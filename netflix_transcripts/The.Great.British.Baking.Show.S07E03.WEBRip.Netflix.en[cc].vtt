[Amelia] <i>I've got to be careful</i>

306
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so it's not obvious
that they're very different sizes.

307
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosie] They're smaller than normal.

308
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

309
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

310
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Henry] I'm doing art,
I'll have you know.

311
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am borderline thrilled with that.

312
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Amelia] Let's go in the proving drawer.

313
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michelle] This is the prove
before it gets baked.

314
00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Priya] It doesn't need long.

315
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
20 minutes may be fine,
but I'll just keep checking.

316
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

317
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

318
00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have one hour left!

319
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One hour!

-[Priya] What?
-[Noel] It's bread week, kids.

321
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry] It's like a sauna in there.

322
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, it is doing something.

323
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So the yeast is working.

324
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I could give it an extra five,
ten minutes.

325
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

332
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I totally know what I'm doing.

333
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, gosh. It's tense, isn't it?

334
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

335
00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amelia] Got to come out.
It looks all right.

336
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

337
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

338
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

339
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] It's definitely puffed up.

340
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosie] It's not proved very well.

341
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It will rise in the oven.

342
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's quite disappointing.

343
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've only got half an hour left!

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. Just the voice broke at the end.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, I'm just gonna bake them now.

350
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna say half an hour,
but I'm gonna check on it

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just gonna sit here

361
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

down here. [chuckles]

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Come on, balls. Cook nicely.

370
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All I can smell is cheese, Michelle,
and I hate cheese so much.

372
00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

378
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause I would normally
take them out of the oven now,

379
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's that finger that prods in the middle.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

not proving.

385
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I can't wait to tell my friends
and my mum. [laughs]

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's official,
Paul Hollywood likes my bread.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am a baker.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not looking forward to Technical.
I never do.

520
00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does anyone enjoy the Technicals?

Time for your Technical Challenge,
and in a shock twist,

525
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it has been set for you
by the bread king, Paul himself.

526
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] It'll be judged blind.

527
00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll have to ask these two lovelies
to leave the tent.

528
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Before they go, Paul, any words of wisdom?

529
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not as easy as you think.

530
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] That's comforting. Right,

531
00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

532
00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

533
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a poodle that Paul cannot wait

534
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'd better move along.

535
00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul would like you to make
eight white burger baps.

537
00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, what is a burger bap
crying out for, people?

538
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-No, a burger.

539
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul would also like you to make
four veggie burgers

540
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to go inside four of your floury baps.

541
00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You have two and an half hours.
-On your marks...

542
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get set...
-Bake!

543
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michael] Oh, dear.

544
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It sounds easy,
but I've never done them before.

545
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michael] I have never made
a floury bap before.

546
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If this works, then it'll be
a new thing I can make.

547
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it doesn't, I'll just buy them
like everyone else.

548
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Burger buns, Paul.

549
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I said,
"It's not as easy as you think,"

550
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it really isn't.

551
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got to develop the gluten properly.

552
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you don't, it'll be very cake-like
and not stringy.

553
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So, good kneading?
-Good bit of kneading,

554
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then leave it to prove
for half an hour, 40 minutes.

555
00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at the texture. See how light it is?

556
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's lovely.
-The burgers are important, to a degree.

557
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
90% of our judging
will be done on the rolls.

558
00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, this is bread week, not burger week.

559
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amelia] Number one, for the floury baps,
"Make the dough".

560
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cheers, Paul.

561
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He might as well have said,
"Make a bap."

562
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've got the usual ingredients,

563
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is yeast, salt, flour and water,

564
00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but then on top of it,
we've got vegetarian lard.

565
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have you made floury white soft baps?

566
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Floury white baps?
I've never made baps before.

567
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't imagine
you're a bap kind of character.

568
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What sort of character am I?

569
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wholemeal pitta bread?

570
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'll take that.
-Prue's a crumpet. [chuckles]

571
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

572
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This has gone weird. Prue--

573
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's take that out.

574
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

575
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Step two, "knead the dough".

576
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My kneading technique is...

577
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't have one.

578
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, God. I think I'm nearly there.
I'm getting a bit tired.

579
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] It's elasticky, smooth. Done.

580
00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Knead the dough", "prove the dough".

581
00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Henry] I'm gonna prove it
for half an hour, see what occurs.

582
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, veggie burgers.

583
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Phil] Never made a veggie burger
in my life.

584
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a meat man.

585
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Number five is, "Tip the black beans
into the bowl of a food processor

586
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and pulse to a rough mash."
-You didn't see that.

587
00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Priya] I want it to be lumpy,
otherwise it is just mush.

588
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've had these veggie burgers,
the bad ones can be slop.

589
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I'm making man-size burgers,
half-a-pounders.

590
00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It could be like a fast food burger,
where it's thin.

591
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or like a good burger
where it's really thick.

592
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I'm gonna go for in the middle.

593
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, freeze.

594
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Bakers, in Morse code, you have...

595
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the hell?

596
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're halfway through, my beauties.

597
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's weirdly pleasurable.

598
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Feel nice?
-Yeah.

599
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Phil] I'm having a look at my dough.

600
00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] It's doubled the size...

601
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's all I can ask for, really.

602
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

603
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Feels nice.

604
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi laughing]

605
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a new game that we invented.

606
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks like a bread dough.

607
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michelle] I'm about to shape my buns.

608
00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to divide into eight pieces,

609
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then shape into burger buns.

610
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I...

611
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
don't know where to begin.
Let's make it an even number.

612
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maths.

613
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Phil] Eighty-five grams per ball.

614
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I've got this much dough left,
which is roughly

615
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
seven grams of dough per bun.

616
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I'm working out

617
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
whether it's worth putting seven grams
of dough back into each bun.

618
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't want them to be too small.

619
00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it's less than 10%.

620
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, less than 10%, sod it.

621
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Gently flatten each ball of dough
and place on prepared trays."

622
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To me, if I have a burger,
I want a big bap.

623
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like quite a pert bun.

624
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna give it another prove
for about 15, 20 minutes.

625
00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Priya] Where's my proving bag?

626
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] This is it, isn't it?
-No.

627
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Where's it gone?
-Is that your proving bag?

628
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
David, can I take this proving bag?
Are you using it?

629
00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll sell that later.

630
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna prove them for half an hour.

631
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
An hour and ten left.
I'll prove them for about half an hour.

632
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Noel, I want a burger in half an hour.
Could you make that happen?

633
00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You got half an hour left!

634
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Half an hour!
-Thanks.

635
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've given my baps half an hour to prove.

636
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm about to have a look.

637
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look quite big.

638
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Amelia] Still small.

639
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the ones at the bottom
have proved slightly more.

640
00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They haven't really changed,
but I'm going with it.

641
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Twelve, lightly dust the baps
with flour, and bake."

642
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Doesn't say for how long.

643
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosie] Hmm.

644
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, they're going in t'oven.

645
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry] Do good things.

646
00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna do 12 minutes
and then keep an eye.

647
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's go for eight minutes
and see what happens.

648
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because, er, these soft ones,

649
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't really know how you tell
when they're done.

650
00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, I'm gonna fry my burgers.

651
00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll cook them until they've browned.

652
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're purple, so it's hard to tell.

653
00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These burgers are not ideal.

654
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michelle] How do I know how long
these are meant to be in for?

655
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at them rising.

656
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're like buttocks.
-[David] Yeah.

657
00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Paul will like that,
'cause he's manly.

658
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about Prue?

659
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] She might be alarmed by the size.

660
00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Posh people tend to like small things,

661
00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-don't they?
-Yeah.

662
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry] Out they come.

663
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoa! Nearly.

664
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michelle] Still too small for my burgers.

665
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am fairly happy.

666
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Phil] Mine are overdone.

667
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

668
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna build them up.

669
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Amelia] The moment of truth.
-Let's hope they're soft and cooked.

670
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michael] The knife is dragging
through the roll.

671
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They want it soft, they're soft.
But so is dough.

672
00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michael] "Assemble the burgers".

673
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Amelia] My burgers are massive,

674
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-compared to my buns.
-And mine.

675
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I didn't use all my dough, did I?
-[chuckles]

676
00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[mockingly] "10% less won't hurt."

677
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm trying to think what goes
first, though? Burger...

678
00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Priya] Lettuce...

679
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rosie] I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't eat burgers.

680
00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After this,
I definitely don't eat burgers.

681
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd be happy to eat that,
even with a veggie burger inside.

682
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need skewers. [exclaims]

683
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up!

684
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Rosie sighs]
-Please bring your burgers and baps

685
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
up to the table and place them
behind your photograph.

686
00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My rolls are tiny.

687
00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>Paul and Prue are looking for</i>
<i>eight beautiful floury white baps,</i>

688
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>with four perfectly cooked burgers.</i>

689
00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>And they have no idea whose is whose.</i>

690
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Right. These are all
pretty much the same.

691
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They could've been a little bit wider,
but they've got some height to it.

692
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Quite chewy.
-[Paul] Mm.

693
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bun tastes pretty good.

694
00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These burgers...

695
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got a nice blend of spices.

696
00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I quite like that.
-[Prue] Yeah.

697
00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] All right,
bringing in the second one.

698
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a quick look inside.

699
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Breaking a bit.
That comes down to the mix.

700
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Nice flavour.

701
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Now, the burger itself, it's nice.

702
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Moving on to number three.

703
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The burgers are too big for the bun,

704
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the buns are irregular
and quite small.

705
00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice flavour, though, on that bun.

706
00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's a massive burger.

707
00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's not very tasty.
-No, it's not.

708
00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Moving on. Too dark.

709
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got too much of a heavy colour.
It is a bit tight inside.

710
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] This is a very crumbly burger.

711
00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Mm. Moving on to the next one.

712
00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The colour of this is good.

713
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bottom of that one, it's quite doughy.

714
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That line that sits underneath,
proof they're underproved.

715
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Again, the burgers
are much too big for the buns.

716
00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] These...
-[Prue] Nice shape.

717
00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's got a bit more size to this.

718
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. See how much more
open it is and irregular?

719
00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Yes.
-[Paul] That's a nice roll.

720
00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A quick taste of this.

721
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not a bad burger either.
-[Prue] Very nice.

722
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] This one's been
very kindly cut already.

723
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Quite tight and down the bottom,

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

there's not a lot of flavour in that.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I've scored one of them too deeply
and it's opened up a lot.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Two hours left.

1038
00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Rosie] The key to getting this right
is the angle of the cuts.

1048
00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's been much better at home.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Helena] I've put the pumpkin loaf
in the oven, in a cast-iron pot,

1072
00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it gives you the perfect humidity
for a really crusty crust.

1073
00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I can de-paper these breads.

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is that it can cover up
what they can see in the grooves.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

over substance.

1080
00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could've done with a bit more salt.

1132
00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't be afraid to add a bit more flavour.

1133
00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think this is delicious.

1134
00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] They're baked beautifully.

1135
00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look great. Very artistic.

1136
00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And lots of perfect scoring.
-Thank you.

1137
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Well done.
-[Paul] Thank you.

1138
00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the definition in that one.
It's a nice-looking loaf.

1139
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] This one's really clever.

1140
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, that's a pretty good,
recognisable globe.

1141
00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's very nice. The nuts and the seeds
give it a lovely flavour, too.

1142
00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It could do with a bit more seasoning.

1143
00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Hm, it's a bit bland,

1144
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the cuts are very good.
It's a nice-looking loaf.

1145
00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Overall, you haven't done too bad.

1146
00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Thanks. Well done.

1147
00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are obviously African masks.

1148
00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But this one, which is sort of broken,
it looks brilliant.

1149
00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks like some artistic rendering
of a scary mask.

1150
00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But that wasn't the challenge,

1151
00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the challenge was to do
really good scoring.

1152
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's barely done.
-Mm-hmm.

1153
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The idea was sound enough.

1154
00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Disappointed.

1155
00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And there's not enough salt in it.

1156
00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All style and no substance.

1157
00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Cool, thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you very much.

1158
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales sharply]

1159
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The whole thing is so imaginative
and so wonderful.

1160
00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fantastic.

1161
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've lost a lot of definition
in the cuts with these.

1162
00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that's because
I baked them in a pot.

1163
00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Could've left them
in the pot a little bit longer.

1164
00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a dense old loaf, that.
-[Prue] And quite heavy.

1165
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The only flavour you get is from
the crust where it's caramelised,

1166
00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the cuts are not good enough.

1167
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know,
I wanted more emphasis on the cuts.

1168
00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got a nice bit of, erm...

1169
00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Little bit of paper?

1170
00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very typical fougasse, quite tough.

1171
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got great flavour.

1172
00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I have seen more decorative fougasses.

1173
00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fougasse is not really conducive
for heavy scoring.

1174
00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it quite soft?

1175
00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That means more in the oven.

1176
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry] Yes.

1177
00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] More proving,
more time in the oven.

1178
00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice flavour.

1179
00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The flavour's good.

1180
00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cuts are a bit ripped
rather than slashed through.

1181
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a shame.
-Yeah.

1182
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Henry.
-Thank you.

1183
00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's highly effective.

1184
00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It hasn't blown anywhere.

1185
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could've left it in longer.

1186
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was scared of that after yesterday.

1187
00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The rosemary flavouring is just right.

1188
00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've well-baked
and well-proved your loaf.

1189
00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your structure's beautiful inside.

1190
00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Love the cuts. Love the design.

1191
00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's excellent, Steph.
-Oh, bless you.

1192
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Yeah, well done. That's very good.
-Thank you.

1193
00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] You can see the cuts,

1194
00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you want to see
more definition in there.

1195
00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you could've done more scoring
and less painting.

1196
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Great structure inside.

1197
00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could've been more potent
with the flavours,

1198
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the cuts a bit deeper.

1199
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But nevertheless, two nice loaves.
-Okay.

1200
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very ingenious.

1201
00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The scoring on the laurel leaves
around the edge is beautiful.

1202
00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That's beautifully baked.

1203
00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Mm.
-[Paul] Wow, it's light.

1204
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all baked well and you have got
some scoring going on.

1205
00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not a huge amount.

1206
00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you've made up for it
because the bread is so delicious.

1207
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1208
00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's really effective.

1209
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Some of your scoring is really neat
and beautiful.

1210
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I quite like the way
you've coloured the bigger scores.

1211
00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've lost some of the definition
in this.

1212
00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[inaudible]

1213
00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's quite smooth.
You expect these to be slightly risen up.

1214
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michelle] Mm-hmm.

1215
00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the flavour.
I would've liked it a bit crustier.

1216
00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I quite like the crust.
It goes all the way around about the same.

1217
00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Let's try the hedgehog.

1218
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So, this is rye, is it?
-[Michelle] Yeah.

1219
00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stodgy.
-[Paul] Quite dense.

1220
00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, rye is always going to be.

1221
00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-However, they taste delicious.
-[Paul] Thank you.

1222
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It does look a bit clumsy, your scoring.

1223
00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no finesse to it.

1224
00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Love the design.
The design's very good,

1225
00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the baking is terrible.

1226
00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, dear.

1227
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why did you bring them out so early?

1228
00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See this one here, how soft they've gone?

1229
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've always been quite soft
when I've practiced them.

1230
00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Is there any flavour in this?
-That one's plain.

1231
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you sure this is underbaked?

1232
00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It needs more colour.
How long was it in there for?

1233
00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Twenty-five, half an hour?
-Yeah, twenty-five minutes tops.

1234
00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow, a loaf that big.
It's 40 minutes before you start.

1235
00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's not much flavour to any of these.
Nothing.

1236
00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need to put flavours with them.
Put big, punchy flavours in there.

1237
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] This one's had
a bit of a burst out, hasn't it?

1238
00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's burst quite badly there.

1239
00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cut it slightly deeper
and it blew the whole thing out.

1240
00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This one looks much nicer.

1241
00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think, overall, the actual image
of what you're trying to do is amazing.

1242
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The red in there looks attractive.

1243
00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You painted that in.
It looks really nice.

1244
00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Looks good.
-[Paul] Nice loaf.

1245
00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour is nice.

1246
00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Design's good. The bake's all right.

1247
00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like it, even though
you've blown out there.

1248
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales heavily]

1249
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It didn't go horribly, which is good.

1250
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] <i>He said</i>
<i>it was style over substance.</i>

1251
00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's pretty brutal.

1252
00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:38.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amelia] I'm definitely at risk to go home
this week, which is absolutely gutting.

1253
00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Keeping everything crossed.
I don't know if that'll be enough.

1254
00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's start with the upbeat stuff.
Steph did very well.

1255
00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Great display.
The scoring on everything was fantastic.

1256
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] Michael?
-[Paul] Michael's done well.

1257
00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He managed to colour the inside,
but he had definition there.

1258
00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You could see there were flames.
-He did really well.

1259
00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Who's at the bottom?
Who are we worrying about?

1260
00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Henry.

1261
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Henry. You can't discount it,

1262
00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
even though he won
the Technical Challenge.

1263
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Amelia.
-I think Amelia's in trouble.

1264
00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you can put
Alice in there as well.

1265
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Still the possibility
two people will go home?

1266
00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think so.

1267
00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Hello, bakers.

1268
00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got the great job this week

1269
00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of announcing the person
who's won Star Baker.

1270
00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The person who's won Star Baker
this week is...

1271
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Michael.

1272
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[clapping]

1273
00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel laughing]

1274
00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have the horrible job
of sending somebody home.

1275
00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It gets tougher and tougher each week.

1276
00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm afraid the person
who is leaving us is...

1277
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Amelia.
-I knew it.

1278
00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] I'm so sorry.
-I knew it.

1279
00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Amelia] <i>I'm absolutely gutted.</i>

1280
00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've always, always said,
bread week for me will be about survival,

1281
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I just didn't survive.

1282
00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:21.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] <i>Amelia's a decent baker,</i>
<i>it showed in her Showstopper.</i>

1283
00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The idea was sound enough
but it wasn't executed well.

1284
00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>She struggled in the Signature</i>

1285
00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and she was low down in the Technical.

1286
00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Phil] I'm sorry to see you go.
-Thank you.

1287
00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry it wasn't a good Showstopper.
I did try.

1288
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bread can take a hike.

1289
00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I live to fight another day. Phew.

1290
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] That was good.
-Thank you very much.

1291
00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a little overwhelmed.

1292
00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Phil] Good man. Well done.

1293
00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe I will try making bread again.
Maybe I'll do it a couple more times.

1294
00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I'll never score it again. [chuckles]

1295

1296

<i>He did well in the Technical,</i>

1297
00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He deserved Star Baker.

1298
00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can go home now. Tick, done.
Bake-Off, sorted. Finished. [chuckles]
