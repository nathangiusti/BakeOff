00:15:14.645 --> 00:15:16.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the avocado on there as well?

303
00:15:16.205 --> 00:15:19.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, um, avocado, asparagus,
chorizo and quails eggs.

304
00:15:20.565 --> 00:15:23.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s a real celebration of rye,
particularly in that one.

305
00:15:23.085 --> 00:15:24.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good.

306
00:15:24.165 --> 00:15:26.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s very good. It’s like the
Mediterranean meets Denmark. Thank you.

307
00:15:26.365 --> 00:15:28.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Well done.
-God, I’m sweating.

308
00:15:34.325 --> 00:15:35.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I’d like to have seen
more colour in that.

309
00:15:35.725 --> 00:15:37.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Manon] Okay. Inside, yeah?

310
00:15:37.485 --> 00:15:40.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Um, and more dense and filled
with seeds preferably.

311
00:15:40.165 --> 00:15:41.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Right.

312
00:15:42.645 --> 00:15:45.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we have goat cheese with
roasted beetroots,

313
00:15:45.485 --> 00:15:47.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
some strawberries, some glazed vinegar.

314
00:15:47.965 --> 00:15:49.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour of your rye is not strong.

315
00:15:50.365 --> 00:15:54.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Also I think it lacks savouriness.
It’s so sweet.

316
00:15:54.085 --> 00:15:54.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, sweet. Uh-huh.

317
00:15:55.045 --> 00:15:56.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It almost needs seasoning, doesn't it?

318
00:15:56.565 --> 00:15:59.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Otherwise it’s just like um, pudding.
-Cheesy.

319
00:16:04.405 --> 00:16:08.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chutney, the walnut, the cheese,
as a sandwich, it’s great.

320
00:16:08.565 --> 00:16:10.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But as a Danish open sandwich?

321
00:16:10.165 --> 00:16:13.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know what bread that is?
Pain de campagne.

322
00:16:13.805 --> 00:16:16.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh really?
-Yeah, you’ve made a French loaf.

323
00:16:24.485 --> 00:16:26.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ve definitely got a rye in there
and it is baked well.

324
00:16:26.805 --> 00:16:27.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

325
00:16:27.805 --> 00:16:29.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And this is a very
beautiful looking texture.

326
00:16:29.365 --> 00:16:31.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope it tastes as good as that.

327
00:16:31.285 --> 00:16:32.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul]
They are beautiful looking sandwiches.

328
00:16:35.405 --> 00:16:38.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flavours are good.
I can really taste the rye.

329
00:16:39.285 --> 00:16:41.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think
the dill makes it authentic

330
00:16:41.405 --> 00:16:44.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and so does the fish,
the avocado and the capers.

331
00:16:44.645 --> 00:16:46.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just... It just needs to be
a little bit stiffer,

332
00:16:46.765 --> 00:16:49.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
more seeds and I think you would have been
nearly there, to be honest.

333
00:16:50.845 --> 00:16:52.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it was all right. It’s fine.

334
00:16:57.085 --> 00:16:59.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can you imagine Prue...
-Yes.

335
00:17:00.325 --> 00:17:03.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
...walking into a, uh,
little coffee shop...

336
00:17:03.125 --> 00:17:04.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that Prue’s walking?
-Is that how she walks?

337
00:17:04.805 --> 00:17:06.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That’s her walk. She walks in and says...
-Yes.

338
00:17:06.365 --> 00:17:08.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Excuse me,
would you mind making a sandwich?"

339
00:17:08.885 --> 00:17:11.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So... And you turn round
and give her that.

340
00:17:12.485 --> 00:17:14.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. Yeah? To be honest with you,
I just... Yeah,

341
00:17:14.205 --> 00:17:16.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I appreciate they’re too big.
I do apologise on that front, yes.

342
00:17:16.965 --> 00:17:18.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know, okay. They’re too big.
Let’s try and judge them anyway.

343
00:17:18.885 --> 00:17:20.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] What is this?

344
00:17:20.084 --> 00:17:22.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Chorizo, Ibérico ham and sweet potato
with a fig jam.

345
00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:28.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I tasted the white rye by itself
and it doesn't taste much of rye.

346
00:17:28.725 --> 00:17:29.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, okay.

347
00:17:29.645 --> 00:17:31.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s more like a malted loaf than a rye.

348
00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:32.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

349
00:17:32.965 --> 00:17:35.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is even more difficult to...

350
00:17:36.725 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like building my own sandwich here.

351
00:17:41.485 --> 00:17:43.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would have thought the smoked mackerel

352
00:17:43.525 --> 00:17:45.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
would have been perfect
but it’s quite dry.

353
00:17:45.205 --> 00:17:46.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, okay.

354
00:17:46.445 --> 00:17:48.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s not rye enough,
it’s not dense enough,

355
00:17:48.125 --> 00:17:53.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it’s not at all like an open sandwich
bread. So you’re in another challenge.

356
00:17:53.125 --> 00:17:54.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It’s a shame.

357
00:18:03.445 --> 00:18:05.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It just gone really soggy.

358
00:18:05.445 --> 00:18:08.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s so dense
it’s almost like a cake there.

359
00:18:08.085 --> 00:18:09.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There’s no air holes in it at all.

360
00:18:09.125 --> 00:18:12.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it does look, to be honest, Rahul,
a bit of a mess.

361
00:18:12.405 --> 00:18:13.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

362
00:18:20.645 --> 00:18:22.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um, oh, dear.

363
00:18:23.485 --> 00:18:24.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no.

364
00:18:25.765 --> 00:18:27.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not for me, mate. The bread’s awful.

365
00:18:28.845 --> 00:18:30.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s like it’s turning back into
a dough in my mouth.

366
00:18:31.045 --> 00:18:31.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul is right, it’s...

367
00:18:32.485 --> 00:18:34.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very stodgy.
-...very heavy and gluey.

368
00:18:34.525 --> 00:18:36.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was the proving and you know that.

369
00:18:36.325 --> 00:18:37.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. I knew that it was the proving.

370
00:18:41.085 --> 00:18:44.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually that reminds me of a flavour
of a sandwich I had in Copenhagen.

371
00:18:45.405 --> 00:18:48.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m avoiding eating the bread because
I don't think it’s entirely edible.

372
00:18:49.645 --> 00:18:52.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you just did too much.
You tried too hard.

373
00:18:53.645 --> 00:18:57.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[whispering] It’s okay, baby.
They’re really harsh today.

374
00:19:01.045 --> 00:19:04.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s not a bad, is it? A real
celebration of rye. Cheers for that, Paul,

375
00:19:04.405 --> 00:19:07.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
on a rye bread challenge.
I mean, what more could I want?

376
00:19:07.565 --> 00:19:13.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It just shows how bad it is that Paul
do not eat the bread because it’s so bad.

377
00:19:14.805 --> 00:19:16.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it was not my best.

378
00:19:16.965 --> 00:19:19.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I’m middle but middle
below kind of thing.

379
00:19:19.965 --> 00:19:24.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I think that I felt like my comments
were the worst, I think I’d be crying.

380
00:19:25.005 --> 00:19:26.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[crying] That was a bit brutal.

381
00:19:28.525 --> 00:19:29.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was harsh, yeah.

382
00:19:31.365 --> 00:19:35.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Get back up. Get back on it.
That’s just who I am.

383
00:19:39.485 --> 00:19:43.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi]<i> For the first challenge the bakers</i>
<i>could practice as much as they liked,</i>

384
00:19:43.165 --> 00:19:46.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>but they’re going into</i>
<i>this second one blind.</i>

385
00:19:46.365 --> 00:19:48.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. Bakers, welcome back
to the Technical challenge,

386
00:19:48.565 --> 00:19:50.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which today has been set for you by Paul.

387
00:19:50.485 --> 00:19:53.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although I’m pretty sure he got the idea
from my house, just saying.

388
00:19:53.445 --> 00:19:54.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, Paul, any advice?

389
00:19:54.685 --> 00:19:58.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s a technique in this recipe you’re
gonna have to learn and learn quickly.

390
00:19:58.605 --> 00:19:59.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, wow.
-[Sandi] Right, thank you very much.

391
00:19:59.925 --> 00:20:01.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Off we go.

392
00:20:02.005 --> 00:20:03.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, for your Technical challenge today,

393
00:20:03.885 --> 00:20:09.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul/Sandi, would like you to make
14 Danish Æbleskiver.

394
00:20:10.365 --> 00:20:15.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your 14 Æbleskiver need to be perfect
with a distinctive spherical shape.

395
00:20:15.725 --> 00:20:20.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your Æbleskiver must be filled
with cinnamon spiced apple

396
00:20:20.245 --> 00:20:23.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and served with a strawberry jam
dipping sauce.

397
00:20:23.605 --> 00:20:25.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have one hour for your challenge.

398
00:20:25.605 --> 00:20:27.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks...
-Get set...

399
00:20:27.085 --> 00:20:27.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake.

400
00:20:29.685 --> 00:20:33.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Ooh. This looks fun.

401
00:20:35.045 --> 00:20:36.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I actually know what they are.

402
00:20:38.045 --> 00:20:40.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have I heard of these before? No.

403
00:20:40.845 --> 00:20:42.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have I seen them before? No.

404
00:20:45.125 --> 00:20:47.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Paul, why Æbleskiver?

405
00:20:47.645 --> 00:20:50.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ve never had one and I’ve never made one

406
00:20:50.285 --> 00:20:52.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I think they sound
incredibly difficult.

407
00:20:53.005 --> 00:20:57.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The best way to show you what an
Æbleskiver is, is cut one open.

408
00:20:58.485 --> 00:21:02.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what you have
is an aerated dough inside,

409
00:21:02.565 --> 00:21:05.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then you have this pocket
of apple and cinnamon.

410
00:21:05.445 --> 00:21:10.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want these beautiful, smooth,
spherical pancakes, if you like.

411
00:21:10.405 --> 00:21:12.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s a lovely, light batter, isn’t it?

412
00:21:12.525 --> 00:21:14.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, it’s delicious

413
00:21:14.725 --> 00:21:18.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the tricky bit. They’ve all got
these metal plates with indentations,

414
00:21:18.645 --> 00:21:22.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
like semicircles. What you’ve gotta do
is pour this batter mixture in.

415
00:21:22.125 --> 00:21:25.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once you see the edges firming up,
you’ve gotta rotate it.

416
00:21:25.325 --> 00:21:28.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once you rotate, you end up with a hole
in the middle

417
00:21:28.485 --> 00:21:31.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and this is where
you put your apple and cinnamon.

418
00:21:31.325 --> 00:21:33.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then you finally rotate
and the batter covers that.

419
00:21:33.965 --> 00:21:35.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sounds hugely difficult.

420
00:21:35.885 --> 00:21:37.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just hope for their sake
that they are cooked

421
00:21:37.445 --> 00:21:39.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
‘cause Sandi’s gonna kick off big time.

A jam dipping sauce.

428
00:21:57.965 --> 00:22:01.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Get it up to 105 degrees
is generally the best thing to do.

433
00:22:13.925 --> 00:22:15.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

436
00:22:20.085 --> 00:22:21.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

a Danish guy for, like, two years.

00:22:30.765 --> 00:22:34.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sounds like a porn star, I’m not gonna
lie, and he made this? So you’ve seen it?

443
00:22:34.685 --> 00:22:35.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Don't wanna knock out too much

00:22:42.405 --> 00:22:44.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

451
00:22:57.605 --> 00:22:59.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

452
00:23:01.165 --> 00:23:02.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't really know what I’m doing.

453
00:23:02.645 --> 00:23:05.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It just says, "Spoon the batter into the
holes until they are three quarters full."

454
00:23:05.405 --> 00:23:08.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is that three quarters full?
Is that too full?

455
00:23:08.365 --> 00:23:09.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m just gonna start and learn as I go.

456
00:23:10.165 --> 00:23:11.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

"Begin to firm."
So it’s not letting it cook fully.

Is 90 degrees like that?

460
00:23:23.565 --> 00:23:24.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Turning 90 degrees.

461
00:23:25.245 --> 00:23:27.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So what does it mean turn it 90 degrees?
-What does it... What do you think?

462
00:23:28.045 --> 00:23:31.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Turning, so I guess like that?
But that’s 180 degrees, innit?

463
00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:34.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What does "turn" means?

464
00:23:35.925 --> 00:23:38.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.
Right, so you go like that.

465
00:23:44.365 --> 00:23:47.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Spoon a little of the spiced apple into
the hole in the batter

466
00:23:47.925 --> 00:23:51.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then turn it another
90 degrees to close.

467
00:23:51.165 --> 00:23:53.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:57.005 --> 00:24:01.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

thing in. Oh, these are not going well.

00:24:02.205 --> 00:24:05.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

471
00:24:07.125 --> 00:24:08.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

472
00:24:09.325 --> 00:24:12.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I mean, it’s a little spherical
pancake with apple stuff inside.

473
00:24:12.845 --> 00:24:16.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

474
00:24:16.685 --> 00:24:18.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

have that much batter.

00:24:18.965 --> 00:24:21.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

afterwards. They will never know. Ouch.

00:26:10.765 --> 00:26:14.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Interesting.
Right, shall we start with this one?

508
00:26:14.205 --> 00:26:15.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm-hmm.

509
00:26:17.165 --> 00:26:18.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hang on a minute.

510
00:26:18.525 --> 00:26:20.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-Hang on a minute.

511
00:26:21.365 --> 00:26:24.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now these look as if they’ve
been torn open to be filled...

512
00:26:24.405 --> 00:26:25.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They have.
-...like doughnuts, you know?

513
00:26:25.885 --> 00:26:28.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cutting it and putting
apple in is not the way.

514
00:26:31.005 --> 00:26:33.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s a bit stodgy.
Someone struggled really rotating them.

515
00:26:34.205 --> 00:26:38.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hmm. Very nice cinnamon flavour though,
and apple.

516
00:26:38.405 --> 00:26:40.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the sauce is not a dipping sauce.

517
00:26:40.805 --> 00:26:44.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, this is a bit too thick.
It's a shame.

518
00:26:44.725 --> 00:26:46.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now moving on, these look a bit neater.

519
00:26:50.005 --> 00:26:51.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There’s the apple filling.

520
00:26:51.525 --> 00:26:54.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Quite chunky apples, which I don't really
mind that much, to be honest.

521
00:26:57.325 --> 00:26:58.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s good dipping sauce though.

522
00:26:59.165 --> 00:27:02.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They’re pretty good. It’s quite aerated
as you can see from inside.

523
00:27:02.565 --> 00:27:03.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. Just the right texture.

524
00:27:03.965 --> 00:27:05.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Hmm. You’ve got a bit of bite
there, haven’t you?

525
00:27:06.845 --> 00:27:08.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at the colour, the colour difference.

526
00:27:08.965 --> 00:27:10.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yeah. They’re not a perfect set.

527
00:27:10.805 --> 00:27:12.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They’re not.
So if we go for one in the middle.

528
00:27:13.965 --> 00:27:14.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Little bit of aeration.

529
00:27:14.965 --> 00:27:16.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got a lot of apple in there actually.

530
00:27:18.405 --> 00:27:19.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bit stodgy inside.

531
00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:22.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the amount of filling though.
It’s rather good.

532
00:27:22.445 --> 00:27:24.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The strawberry dipping sauce
isn’t too bad at all.

533
00:27:26.005 --> 00:27:27.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These have had serious issues.

534
00:27:29.245 --> 00:27:31.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s split. This is to do with the heat.

535
00:27:31.725 --> 00:27:36.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What’s happened with this is it’s browned
very quickly without the batter cooking.

536
00:27:37.525 --> 00:27:39.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. You can taste the
burnt on that as well.

537
00:27:39.565 --> 00:27:41.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s very like a burnt pan... Pancake.

538
00:27:42.845 --> 00:27:46.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Moving onto our last one.
Bit of a difference here in size. Um...

539
00:27:46.845 --> 00:27:49.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Yeah that one is walnut-sized one.

540
00:27:49.525 --> 00:27:52.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Loads of apple in there, Prue.

541
00:27:54.845 --> 00:27:57.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s aerated enough, I just think they
struggled with, with the... Again,

542
00:27:57.765 --> 00:28:01.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with the temperature
and the consistency. Okay.

543

544
00:28:06.725 --> 00:28:10.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In 5th and last place are these.

545
00:28:11.365 --> 00:28:14.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rahul, you can taste the burntness.
Unlucky.

546
00:28:14.445 --> 00:28:15.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

547
00:28:15.365 --> 00:28:17.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In 4th place is this one.

548
00:28:18.445 --> 00:28:22.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Manon, they were sort of all
different sizes, but they tasted good.

549
00:28:23.045 --> 00:28:25.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In 3rd place is this one.

550
00:28:25.925 --> 00:28:28.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They were a little bit stodgy,

551
00:28:28.165 --> 00:28:31.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the overall appearance is better
than the other two.

552
00:28:31.285 --> 00:28:32.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

553
00:28:32.205 --> 00:28:35.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, cutting them with a knife
and filling them with a bit of apple sauce

554
00:28:35.965 --> 00:28:38.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could not understand what hole
you were talking about,

555
00:28:38.125 --> 00:28:39.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I was just, like, just get it in there.

556
00:28:40.965 --> 00:28:44.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So in 2nd place is...this one.

557
00:28:45.925 --> 00:28:50.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kim-Joy, um, they were nice and even.
Really they were a pretty good shot at it.

558
00:28:50.525 --> 00:28:51.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which means in 1st place.

559
00:28:53.885 --> 00:28:56.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, you've got a nice bit of
aeration there,

560
00:28:56.365 --> 00:28:57.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a good bit of apple in there as well.

561
00:28:57.565 --> 00:28:59.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

565
00:29:04.325 --> 00:29:05.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It can be as stodgy all as it likes,

566
00:29:05.605 --> 00:29:07.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean it got me third place.
I didn't, I didn’t come last.

‘Cause, you know, we’ve had Danish Week.

hilarious Hawaiian shirts,

00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:51.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
very jolly and I think suddenly
reality actually set in.

580
00:29:51.645 --> 00:29:55.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it’s semi-finals next week.
We have to be slightly harder.

00:29:59.485 --> 00:30:02.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, Ruby and Kim-Joy are both in
the Star Baker position at the moment.

584
00:30:02.525 --> 00:30:03.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:03.805 --> 00:30:08.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

leave or could be Star Baker.

was perfect, but it wasn't right.

-It’s absolutely sweet.
-Oh.

919
00:47:04.765 --> 00:47:05.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It really is.

[Paul] Danish pastries
looks like Danish pastries.

921
00:47:08.085 --> 00:47:09.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
See the layers,
how tight they are together.

922
00:47:09.765 --> 00:47:11.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There’s butter still in there.

923
00:47:11.805 --> 00:47:14.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s crispy on the outside. If you’d
glazed it, it would have been nicer.

924
00:47:14.725 --> 00:47:15.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, really?

925
00:47:16.005 --> 00:47:16.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] With apricot jam.
[Ruby] Apricot jam?

926
00:47:16.925 --> 00:47:18.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Apricot jam.
[Ruby] Right, okay. Fine.

927
00:47:19.765 --> 00:47:23.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the pastry’s lovely, but Paul is
right about the apricot glaze.

928
00:47:23.725 --> 00:47:26.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not just for its look...
-Yeah, for the taste.

929
00:47:26.205 --> 00:47:27.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
...but because you need a little
bit more sweetness in it.

930
00:47:28.045 --> 00:47:29.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

931
00:47:29.085 --> 00:47:30.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it’s buttery.
I can feel that on my tongue.

932
00:47:30.605 --> 00:47:32.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hmm, yeah.
-You have your honeycomb.

933
00:47:33.645 --> 00:47:34.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm, hmm.

934
00:47:34.565 --> 00:47:37.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah the ginger works.
-That’s delicious.

935
00:47:37.405 --> 00:47:38.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

936
00:47:38.485 --> 00:47:41.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overall I think it’s really nice.
I think the design’s effective.

937
00:47:41.085 --> 00:47:43.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s really nice.
-Yeah, simple and effective.

938
00:47:51.925 --> 00:47:53.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I must say,
I think the way that you’ve

939
00:47:53.725 --> 00:47:56.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
done the skirt with the plaiting
of the marshmallow

940
00:47:56.285 --> 00:47:59.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the face and the bow on top is
all beautifully done. Lovely.

941
00:47:59.965 --> 00:48:01.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what filling have you put
inside your Danish?

942
00:48:02.285 --> 00:48:05.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I just have a bar of chocolate
and the rest is just plain.

943
00:48:07.365 --> 00:48:08.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like it plain.

944
00:48:08.485 --> 00:48:10.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hmm, is that a Danish
or is that a pain au chocolat?

945
00:48:13.925 --> 00:48:15.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One, two, three.

946
00:48:15.325 --> 00:48:16.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all] Ahhh!

947
00:48:16.965 --> 00:48:18.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

948
00:48:21.885 --> 00:48:24.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is a little undercooked in the middle
and overcooked on the outside.

949
00:48:24.765 --> 00:48:27.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Your oven was too high and you kept
it in there for too long.

950
00:48:28.125 --> 00:48:30.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The first thing that happens
in a Danish pastry

951
00:48:30.245 --> 00:48:31.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is butter leaks away from the Danish,

952
00:48:32.325 --> 00:48:36.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
soaks onto the tray, gets drawn up from
the bottom of the pastry

953
00:48:36.285 --> 00:48:37.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then that flashes with the heat.

954
00:48:37.805 --> 00:48:40.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it fries at the bottom.
The bottom fries.

955
00:48:40.125 --> 00:48:41.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. So that’s, that’s
what’s happened there.

956
00:48:41.725 --> 00:48:45.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it’s not just happened on this,
it’s happened on all of them.

957
00:48:45.445 --> 00:48:46.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

958
00:48:48.485 --> 00:48:51.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean that’s been sitting in a pool
of butter and now it’s solidified.

959
00:48:51.765 --> 00:48:52.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s congealed. Mmm.

960
00:48:54.285 --> 00:48:55.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And these chocolates.

961
00:48:56.805 --> 00:48:57.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. It’s good.

962
00:48:57.765 --> 00:49:01.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sweets are very, very good.
Very professional looking, actually.

963
00:49:01.685 --> 00:49:03.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your pastry, however,
I have a big issue with.

964
00:49:03.925 --> 00:49:06.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think your baking was,
was pretty poor on this.

965
00:49:13.925 --> 00:49:17.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I don't think I’ve ever
seen more exquisite piping.

966
00:49:18.405 --> 00:49:20.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-It’s amazing.

967
00:49:20.405 --> 00:49:25.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Um, so it represents my friend Charlotte
and it’s her wearing, like, a gown.

968
00:49:25.925 --> 00:49:29.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The design of it is impeccable.
I mean it’s very, very good.

969
00:49:30.685 --> 00:49:34.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, for me, you’ve had issues
with the butter. It’s all gone.

970
00:49:34.885 --> 00:49:35.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

971
00:49:35.805 --> 00:49:39.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s dry. You see the big gaps?
That’s where the butter’s gone.

972
00:49:39.285 --> 00:49:40.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah.

973
00:49:40.285 --> 00:49:42.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what you’re left
with is just the dough.

974
00:49:42.285 --> 00:49:46.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s definitely, sort of,
under-baked or soggy.

975
00:49:46.845 --> 00:49:48.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’ve under-proved this thing.

976
00:49:48.485 --> 00:49:50.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I worried that, um,
it was quite warm

977
00:49:50.885 --> 00:49:54.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so the butter might be getting
too warm, so I baked it sooner.

978
00:49:54.965 --> 00:49:55.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

979
00:49:59.045 --> 00:50:00.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Shall we do the other filling? This one.
-Hmm.

980
00:50:01.005 --> 00:50:03.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What have you got in that, um...
Is that crème pat?

981
00:50:03.485 --> 00:50:05.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm-hmm.
-What’s in there?

982
00:50:05.325 --> 00:50:06.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um, with...

983
00:50:09.445 --> 00:50:10.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Almond liqueur crème pat?

984
00:50:11.405 --> 00:50:12.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[crying]

985
00:50:12.885 --> 00:50:13.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s okay. It’s okay.

986
00:50:15.405 --> 00:50:16.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s very nice and strong.
I love that.

987
00:50:18.485 --> 00:50:23.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Marzipan’s good. Chocolate’s good.
The jellies are nice. The pastry not so.

988
00:50:24.285 --> 00:50:25.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm-hmm.

989
00:50:25.405 --> 00:50:26.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, Kim-Joy.

990
00:50:26.405 --> 00:50:27.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much.
-Can I help you?

991
00:50:27.925 --> 00:50:29.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me help you.

992
00:50:30.765 --> 00:50:33.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[whispering]
It’s okay, sweet. It’s all right.

993
00:50:34.165 --> 00:50:35.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You did great. Looks beautiful.

994
00:50:39.725 --> 00:50:41.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m good now. I’m fine.

995
00:50:42.285 --> 00:50:43.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just let it out.

996
00:50:53.285 --> 00:50:57.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In the Danish pastries you’ve got ginger
crème pat with some dried blueberries.

997
00:50:57.285 --> 00:51:01.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then it’s got vanilla marzipan
and then there’s some sherbet.

998
00:51:01.245 --> 00:51:06.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And some toffee on her shoes at the bottom
and a marshmallow necklace as well.

999
00:51:06.965 --> 00:51:09.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s not a beard. It’s a necklace.

1000
00:51:14.925 --> 00:51:16.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s got a lovely flavour.
-Oh, good.

1001
00:51:16.885 --> 00:51:19.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Quite like the blueberries in there
and the colour’s nice.

1002
00:51:19.245 --> 00:51:20.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
See the colour, that’s the colour
you’re looking for.

1003
00:51:21.045 --> 00:51:22.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Good.
-And this is sherbet, is it?

1004
00:51:22.925 --> 00:51:24.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes that’s sherbet on the bag, yep.

1005
00:51:25.925 --> 00:51:27.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony laughs]

1006
00:51:28.045 --> 00:51:30.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is, yeah.
-It’s good, isn’t it?

1007
00:51:30.605 --> 00:51:32.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Overall, it’s got a nice flavour.

1008
00:51:32.085 --> 00:51:34.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re the closest one
to get the Danish pastries.

1009
00:51:46.925 --> 00:51:49.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s just burnt. You left it in the oven
ten minutes too long.

1010
00:51:50.165 --> 00:51:51.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Probably yeah, just yeah.

1011
00:51:52.365 --> 00:51:56.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I love the way you’ve used the round
ones for the buttons

1012
00:51:56.245 --> 00:51:59.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it looks positively
Indian and jewelled.

1013
00:51:59.165 --> 00:52:00.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh-oh, here we go. Are you ready?

1014
00:52:00.605 --> 00:52:02.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all] Ahhh!

1015
00:52:03.565 --> 00:52:04.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bring this over.

1016
00:52:08.805 --> 00:52:09.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s tough.

1017
00:52:10.405 --> 00:52:12.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very dry. Really dry.

1018
00:52:13.485 --> 00:52:15.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um, marzipan’s lovely.

1019
00:52:15.165 --> 00:52:17.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very nice.
-It’s got a nice flavour.

1020
00:52:17.525 --> 00:52:19.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Shall we have a jelly sweet?
-Yeah.

1021
00:52:21.925 --> 00:52:24.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Perfect. Ooh, yeah.
-Very nice.

1022
00:52:24.605 --> 00:52:26.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that one is summer mixed berry.

1023
00:52:27.645 --> 00:52:28.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s nice, too.

1024
00:52:28.765 --> 00:52:32.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the hard buttons are basically,
uh, filled with raspberry jam.

1025
00:52:32.405 --> 00:52:33.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

1026
00:52:34.965 --> 00:52:37.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, I love all your sweets.
-Yeah.

1027
00:52:37.405 --> 00:52:40.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The pastry is a bit disappointing.
-Yeah.

1028
00:52:41.485 --> 00:52:44.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Rahul.
-Yeah, thank you.

1029
00:52:47.965 --> 00:52:51.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need a hug. I’m going home today now.

1030
00:52:51.645 --> 00:52:53.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stop saying that.
-Everyone’s the same.

1031
00:52:53.325 --> 00:52:56.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, no, no, Rahul.
Don't say that yet, okay?

1032
00:52:56.205 --> 00:52:59.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't deserve to be here any more
so I just need to be kicked out.

1033
00:53:00.965 --> 00:53:05.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know if I can talk about it. Um...

1034
00:53:07.045 --> 00:53:09.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s fine. [sniffles]

1035
00:53:18.925 --> 00:53:20.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s been a lot of movement,
hasn't there?

1036
00:53:20.765 --> 00:53:22.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, in terms of the rankings?

1037
00:53:22.765 --> 00:53:26.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think some did better than others.
I think Briony’s picked herself back up.

1038
00:53:27.045 --> 00:53:28.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I also think Ruby’s done well.

1039
00:53:28.685 --> 00:53:32.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Kim-Joy’s slipped down
in contention of leaving,

1040
00:53:32.325 --> 00:53:34.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
as well as Manon and Rahul
are in serious trouble.

1041
00:53:34.725 --> 00:53:35.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In trouble.

1042
00:53:35.885 --> 00:53:41.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, I mean Manon did spend, for me,
far too much time making beautiful sweets

1043
00:53:41.205 --> 00:53:43.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and not enough time filling her pastry,
which would have made a huge difference.

1044
00:53:44.565 --> 00:53:46.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] What about Rahul?

1045
00:53:46.165 --> 00:53:47.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] He burnt ‘em basically, yeah.

1046
00:53:48.165 --> 00:53:50.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] If you over-bake the pastry
and all the butter runs out.

1047
00:53:51.005 --> 00:53:53.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I know who’s gonna be Star Baker.

1048
00:53:53.165 --> 00:53:55.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We need to talk about that,
but to who’s going home...

1049
00:53:55.925 --> 00:53:57.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You guys have another cup of tea.
-I’ll put the kettle on.

1050
00:53:57.685 --> 00:53:59.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yep. I’ve got a bottle of fizz for myself.

1051
00:53:59.925 --> 00:54:00.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

1052
00:54:13.565 --> 00:54:16.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right my lovely bakers,
I have loved Danish Week.

1053
00:54:16.405 --> 00:54:21.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought it was great. And I have the
pleasure of announcing the Star Baker.

1054
00:54:21.085 --> 00:54:23.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, this is getting harder
and harder I have to tell you,

1055
00:54:23.485 --> 00:54:25.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but there can be only one,
like, there can

1056
00:54:25.725 --> 00:54:27.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
only be one mermaid in Copenhagen Harbour.

1057
00:54:28.205 --> 00:54:30.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So the Star Baker this week is...

1058
00:54:30.765 --> 00:54:31.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ruby.

1059
00:54:31.765 --> 00:54:33.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all cheering]

1060
00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:38.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Aw!
-Oh, man!

1061
00:54:38.245 --> 00:54:42.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That means that I’ve got the horrible job
of sending one of you home.

1062
00:54:43.005 --> 00:54:46.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And, um, yeah,
this is gonna be a nightmare.

1063
00:54:47.725 --> 00:54:52.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The person who’s leaving
us this week is...

1064
00:54:57.885 --> 00:55:00.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Manon. I’m sorry.

1065
00:55:01.765 --> 00:55:02.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

1066
00:55:06.725 --> 00:55:08.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[crying]

1067
00:55:08.685 --> 00:55:11.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Manon, you know what?
You should be proud of yourself.

1068
00:55:11.405 --> 00:55:14.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, you know,
to get this far is amazing.

1069
00:55:14.205 --> 00:55:15.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know.

1070
00:55:16.085 --> 00:55:18.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] It’s gonna be okay.

1071
00:55:20.165 --> 00:55:21.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Manon.

1072
00:55:21.765 --> 00:55:22.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s just baking.

1073
00:55:23.965 --> 00:55:28.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You did really well, Manon. I’m so sorry.
-Thank you.

1074
00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:31.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ironically it was on a pain au chocolat.

1075
00:55:32.045 --> 00:55:33.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ve learnt so much.

1076
00:55:33.765 --> 00:55:36.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So many things I didn't even thought
I’d be able to actually make.

1077
00:55:36.725 --> 00:55:41.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m a stronger and a stronger baker,
and hopefully a stronger person.

1078
00:55:42.125 --> 00:55:45.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am sad to see Manon go,
she’s a really good French baker.

1079
00:55:46.125 --> 00:55:47.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just not a very good Danish one.

1080
00:55:49.445 --> 00:55:52.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Next week, Rahul.
Start upping it up.

1081
00:55:52.845 --> 00:55:54.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll, I’ll try. I’ll promise you I’ll try.

1082
00:55:54.965 --> 00:55:58.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't expect that.
Just, just, like... Yeah.

1083
00:55:58.925 --> 00:56:01.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Congratulations.
-Thank you. Thank you.

1084
00:56:02.285 --> 00:56:06.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That sounds so silly in my head that I’m
through to the semi-finals, like, what?

1085
00:56:06.485 --> 00:56:09.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See you next week. Oh, my God.

1086
00:56:09.725 --> 00:56:11.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done, Ruby.
-Thank you.

1087
00:56:11.245 --> 00:56:13.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1088
00:56:13.285 --> 00:56:17.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ruby’s done it. I’m very happy for her.
If there was a time to get Star Baker,

1089
00:56:17.645 --> 00:56:20.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this is when you get it, going into the
semi-finals, it gees you up.

1090
00:56:20.525 --> 00:56:21.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got Star Baker.

1091
00:56:21.805 --> 00:56:24.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[screaming on phone]

1092
00:56:25.525 --> 00:56:28.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I told you I’m the quiet one.
I told you I’m the quiet one.
