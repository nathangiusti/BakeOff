66
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The sponges are made with Cox apples,

309
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then the buttercream
is Pink apples with spices.

310
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not getting any apple flavour.
I am getting the spices.

311
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a shame,
I think the sponge is lovely.

312
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the texture
of the buttercream is lovely.

313
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the idea of the puree.
But again, the spices have killed it.

314
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So if this was a spice cake challenge,
you'd win it.

315
00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Misses the brief.
-[Paul] Yeah.

316
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, misses the apple.

317
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[laughter]

318
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Noel.
-Thank you.

319
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Er… Janusz.

320
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Dawn] It's a very light sponge.

321
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I put some toffee apples
and some whipped cream on top, and it…

322
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Dropped?
-…sunk a bit, yes.

323
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'd say quite a bit.
-Quite a lot.

324
00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] How did you put the apple in here?

325
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dawn] I put a layer of apple,
another layer of apple to distribute it.

326
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm not getting a lot of apple.
-Okay.

327
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Got it down the bottom. I actually
really like the apple on the top.

328
00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

329
00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Toffee apples are so powerful.

330
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They make the rest
of the cake rather dull.

331
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

332
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-It does look a bit of a mess.
-It promised a lot.

[Kevin chuckling]

334
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You did it when it was warm.
That's the reaction between cream cheese

335
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the hot cake,
and it just pours out like lava.

336
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, yeah.

337
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] So tell us about your apple cake.

338
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kevin] Well, it's an apple streusel cake
flavoured with almond.

339
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Apples are beautiful in it
with the almond, especially with cream.

340
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Erm…
-[chuckling] Yeah.

341
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It tastes amazing.
It's a bit like a trifle.

342
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just delicious, isn't it?
-We wanted a cake, not a pudding.

343
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

344
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] If I'd walked into a room
and saw that, I'd know that was your cake.

345
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got Maxy written all over it.

346
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is neat as a pin.
-[Prue] I love the decoration on the top,

347
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-the little apple strips.
-Thank you.

348
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, I have made a apple and walnut cake

349
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I've topped the top player
with some caramel.

350
00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That's a really good cake.

351
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Really good.
-Thank you.

352
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The apple comes through beautifully.

353
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Walnut, is that texture at the end.

354
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've
done the apple justice actually.

355
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Oh, my God. Thank you.

356
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[applause]
-Thank you so much.

357
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done, Maxy.

358
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Thank you.

359
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] I'm not sure about the face,

360
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-it's gone all over the place, hasn't it?
-[Prue] I love the face.

361
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, for heaven's sake, it's a witch.
Of course she can be crooked.

362
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Paul] Yeah.

363
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

364
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is my favourite snack
of apples, sour plum and chilli.

365
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love it. Really powerful flavours.

366
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sour plum is perfect.

367
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That cake is beautiful.
-[Prue] It's so light.

368
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was gonna say I didn't get the chilli.
It's just come in.

369
00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not sure about the face.

370
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But nevertheless…

371
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, thank you. [chuckling]
-I'm really glad. You deserve that.

372
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Chilli is the thing that gets me.
It's a real triumph. Flavour's back.

373
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Thank you.

374
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm very pleased. First, the handshake,
and they said my flavour's back!

375
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

376
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just feel super, super happy.
I'm over the moon.

[Maxy and Syabira mumbling excitedly]

378
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm pleased for Maxy and Syabira.
Syabira's first handshake.

379
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just a shame.

380
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Apart from the obvious construction issue,

381
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they said a lot of nice things about it,
which was really sweet of them.

382
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dawn] I don't think it was
a disastrous judging,

383
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I'm really worried that at this stage,

384
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you really need to nail it, and I didn't.

385
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And my technicals
have been very up-and-down,

386
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I've got to throw everything at this.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Matt] On your marks.
-Get set--

[shrieks]

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake?

414
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Goodness.

415
00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] S'mores.

416
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[emphasises] S'mores. S'mores.

417
00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Alrighty.
-[Kevin] S'mores.

418
00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're a distinctly American confection.

419
00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never had one,
but seen it in the movies.

420
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never made
marshmallows or digestives.

421
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckling] I'm completely lost!

422
00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, Paul, s'mores.

423
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a great challenge, actually.

424
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the reason why I said
about the two contrasting textures

425
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is obviously the marshmallow.

426
00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then, the actual biscuit itself.

427
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The biscuit's straightforward enough.

428
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's about rubbing
all the dry ingredients with the butter,

429
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
adding the liquid, bringing it together.

430
00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The next thing is obviously
the marshmallow,

431
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is basically
whipped Italian meringue.

432
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you gotta add gelatine.

433
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The key thing is, once you've added
the gelatine, is leaving it to set.

434
00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, if they don't,
the whole thing could collapse.

435
00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We want it to be as neat as possible.

436
00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We want the chocolate
in there as well, not too much.

437
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't want it flooding down the side.

438
00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But then, you want this blowtorch
around the outside of the marshmallow.

439
00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, they could go wrong with this
because if they add too much heat,

440
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's going to melt.

441
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So very lightly.
-And it just looks beautiful.

442
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ultimately, you're meant to
eat it like this.

443
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing] I don't know if I can.

444
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You get covered in chocolate, marshmallow

445
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and a little bit of crumbs of biscuit.
It's lovely.

446
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is good.
-But, hold back.

447
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've got another seven to try.

448
00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
First, I need to make
the biscuits' dough and chill.

449
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dawn] I have made
digestive biscuits before,

450
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but no, you just buy them.

451
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kevin] I'm looking for a biscuit dough
that holds together and isn't too crumbly.

452
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So when I roll it out,
it will still hold its shape.

453
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Hello.
-Hello.

454
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you get a handshake?

455
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did. Right hand.
I haven't washed it since then.

456
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Can I touch it?

457
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-Ahh!

458
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I need some of that power.
-That Paul power?

459
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did it feel like?

460
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was surprised.

461
00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you look into his eyes
when he shook your hand?

462
00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I didn't,
I was just like, "Thank you."

463
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm more happy because
they said my flavours is back, so…

464
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Wow!

465
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dawn] I think this is about right.

466
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dough is done and I'm going to chill it.

467
00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. I'm going to crack on
with the marshmallow now.

468
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Marshmallow is really
just an Italian meringue.

469
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm guessing it's with gelatine.
I don't really know how to make it.

470
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] Whip your egg whites
up with sugar,

471
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
keep on whipping. Done.

472
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you a fan of s'mores?

473
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I've never had a s'more.
-[Matt] Too sweet for me.

474
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know the sweetest thing I've ever eaten.

475
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-When I was a little kid,

476
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
my mum had sweeteners
that you put in your coffee,

477
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and I ate a couple of those.
-Ooh!

478
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-All my hair fell out.
-I-- [chuckles]

479
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] Stiff peaks. I think we're there.

480
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] I need to bloom the gelatine.

481
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>Gelatine is key</i>
<i>to the marshmallow's structure.</i>

482
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dawn] Let's hope this works.

483
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>But adding it</i>

484
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abdul] I'm now putting
the syrup inside the meringue.

485
00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>Unless their gelatine</i>

486

<i>the bakers could end up</i>

487
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, shoot. I forgot my gelatine.

488
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did I forget something?
I feel like I've forgotten something.

489
00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I forgot to put gelatine in there. Damn!

490
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I forgot to put the gelatine in.
What happens now?

491
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was going to put it in the syrup.
I don't know if I've ruined it.

492
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hello, Dawn of the Dead.
-You all right?

493
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you get a handshake?

494
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. Made good toffee apples apparently,

495
00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the cake was rubbish.

496
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dentist's nightmare, though,
the toffee apple.

497
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, God, yeah,
that's why I've got so many fillings.

498
00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got fillings that go right down
my back teeth and all down one leg.

499
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Really? That's impressive.
-Yeah.

500
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Into my long toe.
-That's very good. That's very impressive.

501
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which is my second toe
'cause I'm an amphibian.

502
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kevin] We're just about there.

503
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Righty-ho, that's setting.

504
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] Looks nice and bouncy.

505
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] I don't know what I'm looking for.

506
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just gonna stick with it.

507
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Next, I'm going to roll out biscuit dough.

508
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] Pleased with my dough.

509
00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kevin] We're looking for 16
of these bad boys.

510
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] One, two, three, four, five, six…

511
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're sticking to the paper.
I'll reroll it.

512
00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, what a mess!

513
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And now the stamping will be fun.

514
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] It's very delicate.

515
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Maxy] They're all different shapes,
but, you know, it'll be fine.

516
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That one can be hidden at the bottom.
Let me bake them.

517
00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The instructions doesn't say how long.

518
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] Good luck, biscuits. Do me proud.

519
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Noel, are you okay?

520
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, my gerbil died.
-I'm so sorry to hear that.

521
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not bothered about that.

522
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's just, he's haunting me.
-[exclaims]

523
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, hello.

524
00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ow! Still bites.

525
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you are halfway through.

526
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-Oh, my goodness.

527
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What am I doing? Ganache, ganache.

528
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Classic ganache is half and half, so
it's half double cream and half chocolate.

529
00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] The ganache should be set,
not a watery ganache.

530
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it needs time to be in the fridge.

531
00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it's so liquidy.

532
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pop that in the fridge for a minute.

533
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Maxy] What's going on
with these biscuits?

534
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still looking a bit pale and squidgy.

535
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just a bit more.

536
00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] Paul is going to say
it's not golden enough.

537
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Been trying to get more to his tan,

538
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'm going to give it
another two minutes.

539
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They look ready.
-Yeah.

540
00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] I feel like
they are digestive-y biscuits.

541
00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are starting to go golden round
the edges, I think that's the sweet spot.

542
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They could have been more uniform.

543
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] They're looking pretty good.
Have you made digestives before?

544
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, this is the first time.

545
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, they're so cheap.

546
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like, "Hmm, I'll just go buy it."

547
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's your passion
as a baker coming out.

548
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] Yes.

549
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

550
00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my goodness.

551
00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dawn] Panic, panic.

552
00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Turn the marshmallow out,
cut out eight rounds of it."

553
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] My marshmallow's definitely wrong.

554
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not as stable as it should be.

555
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abdul] It's set from the outside,
but I think from the inside,

556
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's still very wet and sticky. Hmm.

557
00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles] Risky.
-[sighs]

558
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dawn] I'm gonna
get it done in time if it kills me.

559
00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, this isn't easy.

560
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kevin] So sticky.

561
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] Come on, baby. Get out.

562
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] This ain't looking too great!

563
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Syabira] Chocolate.
-It's assembly time.

564
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just giving the ganache a spread.

565
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] I wish I set the chocolate first.

566
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They did the right thing by cooling
theirs because mine is quite soft.

567
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh.

568
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] Oh, no, no.

569
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a pain in the ass to assemble.
-[Sandro] They don't like mess.

570
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Maxy] That one's not great.
They're just not looking uniform.

571
00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have one minute left.

572
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, I have to be careful now.

573
00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] I'm looking for a golden colour.

574
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] Is this one on fire?

575
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kevin] Doing a bit of touch up.

576
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, too much!

577
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] No, they're all burning.

578
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just, just don't start dripping.
I wish I set my ganache.

579
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abdul gasps] No!
Why are you doing this to me, man?

580
00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up.

581
00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] Not bad.

582
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] A mess is what this is.

583
00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please bring your s'mores
down to the gingham table

584
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and place them behind your photograph.

585
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] Thank God, it's over.

586
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] I think I've cooked it too much.

587
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue</i>
<i>are looking for eight s'mores</i>

588
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>with crisp digestive biscuits,</i>

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

590

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Start with this one. Straight off,
lost the definition in the biscuit.

592
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

593
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I like the biscuit.

594
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] But the marshmallow
just melts a bit too readily.

595
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's more meringue than marshmallow.

596
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Okay.
-[Paul] This one.

597
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice bit of colour on that biscuit.

598
00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] They look nice.
I like how it's torched.

599
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This has got much more
definition on the biscuit.

600
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Got a bit more chew.

601
00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bit more goo to the marshmallow as well.
-A little bounce.

602
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Moving on. Bit all over the place.
Colour looks a bit light as well.

603
00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Not identical, are they?
-[Paul] No.

604
00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bit rubbery, that biscuit.
-[Prue] Marshmallow's too soft.

605
00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Hmm.
-And the biscuits also slightly too soft.

606
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It is.

607
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] This is definitely chocolate drips,
which we didn't intend.

608
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, the chocolate's gone everywhere.

609
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All down the side.

610
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The biscuit's all right.

611
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very soft marshmallow.
It disappears almost instantly.

612
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

613
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The colour is perfect on the side.

614
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And also, they all look exactly the same

615
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the definition is really good.

616
00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just that one's lost a bit.
-[Paul] Mmm.

617
00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The chocolate is the right consistency.

618
00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Texture's perfect.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

621
00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A little bit messy.
The colour's all right on the side.

The biscuits are really nice,
but they're quite well baked, aren't they?

623
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Any longer, and it would've been too much.

624
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're not the best-looking things,

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

650
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although Paul say it's 95%,
it's A-plus still.

Not great, not good enough.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Potentially, I'm in trouble.
The competition is just incredibly fierce.

659
00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't feel
in a particularly strong position

660
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because the morning was rough,

661
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I don't think there was much in it.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Structurally, has to be sound,
but it's got to taste good as well.

690
00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has to be robust enough to hang,

691
00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but fragile enough to crack it
with one bang of a rolling pin

692
00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so that sweet treats
can tumble out like a piñata.

693
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

timing will be really crucial

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it'll be tricky enough to make
and bake sweet treats and the lanterns,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they have to have time
to do it exquisitely.

of melted chocolate on.

927
00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How's it all going?

928
00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tried to do too many things,
and I've run out of time.

929
00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've gotta join this together,
but it's extremely wonky-looking.

930
00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kevin] I'll take off the rough edges
and it'll pop together.

931
00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dawn] I've got to just see
if I can make it meet.

932
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

933
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God.

934
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's some gaps, but what can you do?

935
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abdul] I am flattening the tops
just to make sure that it lies flat.

936
00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What I don't want is,
it's going to be all wonky.

937
00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] I'm coating this with chocolate,

938
00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
like a texture of a spider skin.

939
00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandro] That looks good, Syabira.
-Thank you, Sandro.

940
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] That is
a perfect ball right there.

941
00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I plan to completely cover
the entire ball with skulls.

942
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] This just isn't sticking.

943
00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dawn] We're struggling. Just gonna make
some buttercream really quickly.

944
00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need options, at the moment.

945
00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very dodgy.

946
00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

947
00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] Ah, it cracked!

948
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a big old crack right there.

949
00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What crack?

950
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

951
00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna pipe the centre
of these macarons.

952
00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sweet peanuts
just need to come out of the mould.

953
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then I need to ganache
the spider and put it together.

954
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

955
00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gonna break.

956
00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dawn] This isn't going to be
hanging on anything.

957
00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It'll be hanging by a thread.

958
00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

-[Sandro] These smell gorgeous!

960
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flake, lamination…

961
00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A bit chewy.

962
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] It's falling apart.

963
00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[clicks tongue] Oh.

964
00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

965
00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] I'm cutting through
to make the hole.

966
00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm really trying.
I think I need a drill.

967
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

968
00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah.

969
00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know whether to
be shocked or turned on.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

971
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I could just get it to hold together,

972
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can get the eyes on, at least

973
00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not gonna hang.

974
00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[inhales sharply] It's not going to hang.

975
00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yeah.

[Janusz] It's popcorn
with white chocolate.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] Ooh! Look at those!
Are they moustaches?

979
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. They're supposed to be spider legs.

980
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

990
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I decided to cut the Florentines in half,
because they won't go in as a whole.

991
00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1008
00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1012
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to go in your lantern.

1015

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can't eat anything else,
won't be able to taste anything else.

1033
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's clever. The box is very neat as well.

1034
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And I love the popcorn
and the eyes look really well made too.

1035
00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

1036
00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Let's try the biscuit first.

1037
00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The biscuit has a lovely almond flavour.

1038
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Lovely. Quite short as well.

1039
00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's trick truffles.

1040
00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the one with the cricket flour?

1041
00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And a whole cricket inside as well,
for a crunch.

1042
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1043
00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just casually threw that in there.

1044
00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit too sickly sweet for me.

1045
00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] You should have
had more crickets in there.

1046
00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The crickets have got
quite a nice savoury flavour.

1047
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would've balanced it better.

1048
00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] Next you've got pumpkin spice.

1049
00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. Over-spiced.

1050
00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Which is a pity,
because I like the textures.

1051
00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just concerned about some
of your flavours going wayward.

1052
00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm.

1053
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shame.

1054
00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
What happened to the lid?

1055
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unfortunately, a zombie
came into the tent, and smashed it.

1056
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughter]

1057
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] We saw them, actually.

1058
00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Maxy] Yeah.
-They are Noel's family though.

1059
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's a bit of a mess,
but it is hanging.

1060
00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I like the biscuit.
It's not too sweet, and it's very orangey.

1061
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bake's got a nice crunch to it.

1062
00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Almost shortbread-like. Right.
-[Prue] Give it a whack.

1063
00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The treat's pumpkin spiced macaron.

1064
00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It's delicious macaron.
-Thank you.

1065
00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Soft in the middle,
crunchy outside.

1066
00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And just the right amount
of pumpkin spice.

1067
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] I also made brownie monsters.

1068
00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Chocolatey, nutty. Extremely dense.
You couldn't have too many of them.

1069
00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're very rich. Tasty, but they are
massive for what you need.

1070
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they'd been tiny,
the denseness wouldn't have mattered.

1071
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] The lantern looks neat as a pin.

1072
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well-constructed.

1073
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seems pretty solid. Shall we have a taste?

1074
00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Softer than I thought it would be.
-[Abdul] Okay.

1075
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it could have been baked
a little bit longer.

1076
00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the flavour is delicious.

1077
00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you ready?
-[Abdul chuckles] It might be ready.

1078
00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Prue] Right.

1079
00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Again.
-[Matt laughs]

1080

1081
00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dramatic. [laughs]

1082
00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that's so satisfactory, I tell you.

1083
00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, so we've got witch's fingers.

1084
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Brandy snaps covered

1085
00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely flavour with the matcha.

1086
00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not normally a great matcha fan,

1087
00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I think that is perfect.

1088
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's nice and thin
and the almond is delicious.

1089
00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Right. This is the dates.
-[Abdul] Yes, the date ball inside.

1090
00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The texture is good,
but all I'm getting is rose water.

1091
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-It's too strong.

1092
00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you'd pull that back a bit,
allow all the other flavours,

1093
00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the pistachios to come through
the dates to come through,

1094
00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you would have
been onto something.

1095
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's just overwhelming.

1096
00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-[Prue] Well, it's quite scary.
-[Noel] Really scary.

1097
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But it's very messy.
-[Paul] Okay.

1098
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do your worst.

1099
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Go on, Prue, give it some.

1100
00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Hey!

1101
00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Is it gingerbread?

1102
00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kevin] No, it's sugar cookie
with orange and five-spice.

1103
00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ganache is delicious.
Biscuits, lovely and crisp.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Eating the macron?
-[Prue] Mmm-hmm.

1105
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very sweet, but good flavour.

1106
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit crispy, though.
You want it to be a bit chewy inside.

1107
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They weren't my strongest macarons.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] What's this made of?
-[Kevin] Butterscotch with salted peanuts.

1109
00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Sweetness rather than flavour.
-Yeah.

1110
00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it needs to be finished properly.

1111
00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Something with the nuts
sort of hanging out.

1112
00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-I think it's all right.

1114
00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

1115
00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] Normally Prue's territory,
saying things like that.

1116
00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-[Paul] Erm, the whole thing

1117
00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
just needed more time, more effort
'cause each bit is not perfect.

1118
00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm-hmm.

1119
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Dawn] It may not hang. You can try.

1120
00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, please.
-[Sandro] Yay!

1121

-[Syabira] Hey!

1122
00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, it's a bit messy, isn't it?

1123
00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, it is.

1124
00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The two halves aren't perfectly together,
but the general idea is impressive.

1125
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Let's look inside.

1126
00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, that worked.

1127
00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:32.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's black cocoa powder biscuit.

1128
00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got a bit of cardamom as well,
but only a very small amount.

1129
00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Very hard.
-Can't really taste anything.

1131
00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, okay.

1132
00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's nice and thin, which is just as well,
because it is rock hard.

1133
00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Now, my issue with the macarons,
they're a little bit too simple.

1134
00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wanted to do
a lot more detail on the face.

1135
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's just chocolate ganache?
-[Dawn] Yeah, with a bit of brandy.

1136
00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Again, that's quite simple.
-Yes, yes.

1137
00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chewy in the middle, shiny on top.

1138
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Good.
-[Paul] Hmm.

1139
00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eyes.

1140
00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The jelly eyes
are really beautiful.

1141
00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'Cause the jelly is unsweetened,

1142
00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's just texture,
but you do get the chocolate.

1143
00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just think it's all a little bit,
dare I say, basic?

1144
00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it looks amazing.
I mean, really stunning.

1145
00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even down to the green light
coming from the mouth.

1146
00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is astonishing to look at,

1147
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and everything
is very neatly and delicately done.

1148
00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's unbelievable.
Your dark chocolate is bitter enough

1149
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to work really nicely
with the ginger biscuit itself,

1150
00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is exceptionally crunchy.

1151
00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do you want to smash this one, Prue?
-[Prue] Yeah.

1152
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Whoa!

1153
00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Whoa!
-[Paul] And it's still holding.

1154
00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Sinister finger.

1155
00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Peanut biscuit's lovely.

1156
00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crumbly, the peanut kick is just perfect.

1157
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Beautiful.

1158
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So this is orange…
-And white truffle.

1159
00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cream cheese filling.

1160
00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. Oh.

1161
00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Too much truffle.
-Oh.

1162
00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-Why did you put truffle in there? Why?

1163
00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not working?

1164
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It had flavour, I'll give you that.

1165
00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Syabira, you're off your head, honestly.

1166
00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1167
00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Orange and truffle
does not go in a biscuit.

1168
00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I accept they didn't like
the white truffle and an orange.

1169
00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's fine. [chuckles]

1170
00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[softly] Well done.

1171
00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
White truffle. [laughs]

1172
00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is very good comments,
and I'm very happy with it.

1173
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't want to jinx it,
but I was hoping for Star Baker this time.

1174
00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

1175
00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kevin] That went pretty much as expected.

1176
00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I reckon
I'm not only in danger of going home,

1177
00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's a pretty foregone conclusion.

1178
00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dawn] I'm bracing myself, to be honest.

1179
00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm kind of, you know,
trying to get my head around the idea

1180
00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that I might not come back next week.

1181
00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

1182
00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] We learned something
from that showstopper

1183
00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is that
when Dame Prue has too much sugar,

1184
00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we need to keep
that rolling pin away from her

1185
00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because she'll whack anything in sight.

1186
00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And will eat any creature.

1187
00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Loves a cricket.

1188
00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I thought that, overall,
one person did better than anybody else.

1189
00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And I would say Syabira.
-[Prue] Yeah.

1190
00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] When you look at the circumstance
we were coming into today…

1191
00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause she'd had a handshake
and won the technical.

1192
00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She won the technical.
-There you go.

1193
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's unstoppable.
That's the long and short of it.

1194
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does she have competition for Star Baker?

1195
00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:43.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For the first time, no.
There's not gonna be a shock.

1196
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The ideas of all of the bakers were sound.

1197
00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just thought there was a little bit
of a rush job on some of these bakes.

1198
00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, Kevin's spider looked such a mess.

1199
00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:56.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's Kevin and Dawn in a bit of trouble.
Didn't think Dawn really did enough.

1200
00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Coming into today, I would've said,
at the bottom of a very tight group,

1201
00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it was Dawn and Kevin at the bottom,

1202
00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I think
we're still looking at those two now.

1203
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Hello, bakers.

1204
00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Luckily, I've got the great job
of announcing Star Baker this week.

1205
00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that person has had an amazing week.

1206
00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Handshake, first in technical,

1207
00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
great showstopper.

1208
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Syabira.

1209
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[applause]
-[Maxy exclaims]

1210
00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[indistinct chatter]

1211
00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now I have the less fun job
of announcing who is leaving us.

1212
00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we obviously
are growing closer to all of you,

1213
00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and so this person
will really be missed actually.

1214
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry to say that the person
who is leaving us this week is…

1215
00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dawn.

1216
00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's fine.

1217
00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

1218
00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Dawn sniffles, sighs]
-Aw, poor Dawn.

1219
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Dawn chuckling]
-[Paul] Well done, Dawn. You did well.

1220
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Game over. [chuckles]

1221
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really don't want to shed tears over it

1222
00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it's just been
the most amazing experience, really.

1223
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One of the absolute
best experiences of my life.

1224
00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't wish for more than that.
You know, and there's a tear, look.

1225
00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't let anyone see that.

1226
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My kids will be like,

1227
00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Mum doesn't do emotion.
What the hell's going on?"

1228
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

1229
00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm really, really proud
of what I've done.

1230
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I've had fun.

1231
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Such fun.

1232
00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you okay?
-I don't understand.

1233
00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In my head, I was already gone.

1234
00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And yeah, mmm…
I didn't expect that at all.

1235
00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now I'm in the top half of the bakers.

1236
00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

1237
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's another weird feeling.
I wasn't expecting that either.

1238
00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And well done, Syabira.
