that buttery coating on the outside,

the sandwich filling must be unctuous too.

the texture right so that you can pipe it.

55
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because they'll begin to melt.

57
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

thick and difficult to eat.

-Yeah.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-No, don't.

511
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Oh, I love them.

512
00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-So cute.

513
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the definition is all there.

514
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This one's very nervous.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sumayah] There was an accident.

516
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sumayah] So they're
a rosemary and lemon biscuit

517
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with a blackberry and rosemary jam
and a goat's cheese and honey buttercream.

518
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Beautiful. The blackberry
really works with it.

519
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cheese gives it a nice sourness
to it as well, it balances that out.

520
00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I really think it's a little triumph,
and they're funny as well.

521
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] That's good.

522
00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So we've had ducks and we've had swans.

523
00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mm-hmm.
-Will we get flamingos at some point?

524
00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] Who knows?

525
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done. Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

526
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm really happy with how it went.

527
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel surprised
that they found it really nice

528
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because I hated the flavour.

529
00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For Prue to say that I was an alchemist,
I thought that was a good compliment.

530
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That wasn't very good.
I didn't think I panicked,

531
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I obviously did. I left the icing out.

532
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Illiyin] I knew biscuits
were a challenge,

533
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and to fulfil the prophecy
is a bit gutting.

534
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Andy] Getting them comments,
just fantastic.

535
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not like taking a biscuit
round to your mum for a cup of tea.

536
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry. Flipping hell, what's come over me?

537
00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just dreading the technical.
I dare say, I'll be awful at that.

538
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, don't. I mean, let's hope
they give us a recipe this time.

539

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Hi, guys,
your technical challenge has been set

555
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Baroness of Biscuits, Prue Leith.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue Leith,
have you got any crumbs of wisdom

557
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, this challenge is judged blind,
so, Paul and Prue,

561
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
pop off to your sleeping bags
and dream of sweet, biscuity dreams.

562
00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, our judges would love you
to make a batch of 12 mint cream biscuits.

563
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

564
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your mint cream should consist
of a buttery biscuit

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

in a tempered dark chocolate.

576
00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Peppermint cream biscuit.
I know what all of those words mean.

577
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

578
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It tastes like toothpaste.

579
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're great dunked in a coffee.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[birds chirping]

582
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mint cream biscuits,
my nan had these in the house.

583
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A real treat
if we got a chance to have one.

584
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They had shiny, green foil. Remember?
-Yeah.

585
00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] There's a shortbread biscuit,
mint cream, then tempered chocolate.

586
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All of that's difficult.

587
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They can overwork the biscuit dough
and then they'll have a tough biscuit

588
00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and, of course,
tempering chocolate, that's tricky.

589
00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously if it's too thick,
it'll be a right mess.

590
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Yes.
It's really important that it's neat.

591
00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because it's a very elegant treat.
They need to get the proportions right.

592
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Just the right level
of mint cream to biscuit.

593
00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not too much chocolate.
That's what I remember as a kid.

594
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's one of those things,
you got the biscuit barrel,

595
00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
took the lid off, looked inside,
you went "A-ha!"

596
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You see that foil-wrapped biscuit.
"That's the one."

597
00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It didn't last. [laughs]
-No, it didn't.

598
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the first method,
"Make the biscuit dough."

599
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lots of detail in that, isn't there?

600
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Illiyin] It's a shortbread, crumbly.

601
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna just use my hands
without overworking the dough, right?

602
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Hazel] They need a little bit longer.

603
00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like the number one criticism
they're gonna have of the biscuits

604
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is that they're overworked.

605
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Last week I came last in technical.

606
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually there were only 11 of us
last week, now there are 12.

607
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I could be 12th. So it could get worse.

608
00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Christiaan] It stresses me out.
-You had a good signature.

609
00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It doesn't mean anything.
-'Course it does.

610

1431
01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to then find themselves
in this beautiful flower meadow

1432
01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
where there is like a big white tent.

1433
01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And inside,

1434
01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they find this biscuit wonderland

1436
01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's utterly charming.
It's really detailed.

1437
01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know how you managed
to do it in the time.

1438
01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never seen anything like that
in the tent. Very professionally done.

1439
01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1440
01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The spice level in that is perfect,
and it snaps, there's a crunch to it.

1441
01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Delicious.

Spritz curtains, which are flavoured
with saffron and grapefruit.

1444
01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1445
01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Honestly.

1448
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Absolutely.

1449
01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:12.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's one of the best things
I've ever seen in the tent. Ever.

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:15.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1454
01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Christiaan] I did not see that coming.

1455
01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These moments that you wanna
really be, like, in the moment,

1456
01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I wasn't,
because I was completely gobsmacked.

1457
01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's absolutely insane.

1458
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it went okay.

1459
01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They really liked my design,
so I'm happy with that.

1460
01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I'm definitely in the bottom three
and I think I could go home.

1461
01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Hazel] I'm expecting them
to send me home.

1462
01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd be more surprised if I'm in.

Guys, it's been an eventful
couple of days.

Jeff left the tent again. Illiyin fainted.

-[Prue] Christiaan was fantastic.

1470
01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is one of the best bakes
I've seen in the tent for 15 years.

1471
01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Somebody else did well. There's Sumayah.

1472
01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

we need to talk about.

1474

Georgie lacked slightly in her showstopper
and she was ninth in the technical.

1475
01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Illiyin's showstopper tasted pretty good.

1476
01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Problem was it was slightly underbaked.

1477
01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was about her and her husband,
neither of whom featured.

the Punch and Judy characters
were a little bit basic.

Well, bakers, luckily,
I've got the great job of announcing

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, unfortunately,
I've got the real sad news.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the tent today is…

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did expect it.
All my bakes have gone wrong.

any more. [laughs]

that that is going to keep happening,

1508
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was a total surprise. I'm so happy.

1509
01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One million percent,
I thought it'd be Christiaan.

I've got a showstopper handshake
in the bag and I cannot believe it.
