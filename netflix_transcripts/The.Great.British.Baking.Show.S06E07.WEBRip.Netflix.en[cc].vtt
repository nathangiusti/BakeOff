vegan signature challenge,

45
00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:08.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the judges would like you
to make eight savoury tartlets

00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:11.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with two different fillings.
So you need four tartlets with one filling

47
00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:13.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

48
00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:15.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

49
00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:18.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

57
00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:38.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

58
00:02:38.845 --> 00:02:41.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] We set this challenge,
basically, because it’s difficult.

59
00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:43.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Traditionally, you would use butter,

60
00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:46.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you would use eggs to create
a beautifully short pastry

61
00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:48.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but that isn’t an option here.

62
00:02:48.445 --> 00:02:50.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So this is really gonna challenge
the bakers to create flavours,

63
00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:52.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to create textures.

64
00:02:52.445 --> 00:02:55.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The most important thing
is that these bakers

65
00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:58.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
deliver on flavour
and we know they can all do that.

66
00:02:58.285 --> 00:02:59.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can they do it vegan style?

00:03:07.725 --> 00:03:10.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you always need some fat.

72
00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:19.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So olive oil or coconut oil.

73
00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:22.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Coconut oil resembles butter in many ways.

74
00:03:22.605 --> 00:03:23.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

75
00:03:24.445 --> 00:03:26.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Instead of butter,
I’m just using vegetable shortening.

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:29.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

and little bit of chilli.

77

78
00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:35.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I also have some vegan margarine,

79
00:03:35.525 --> 00:03:36.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

80
00:03:36.645 --> 00:03:37.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I’m just bringing it all together now.

81
00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:42.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is flour, avocado oil,
I’ve also put some poppy seeds in.

00:08:49.965 --> 00:08:51.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Neat absinthe.
-[coughs] Wow.

203
00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:53.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

204
00:08:54.525 --> 00:08:57.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I’m making a vegan béchamel.
This is cashew milk.

205
00:08:57.885 --> 00:09:01.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like it’s the closest consistency
and taste to milk.

206
00:09:01.605 --> 00:09:03.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ruby] This is my
roasted butternut squash.

207
00:09:03.765 --> 00:09:07.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve snuck in some chilli flakes
but maybe I'll just add in a touch more.

208
00:09:07.725 --> 00:09:08.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want it to be punchy.

209
00:09:10.485 --> 00:09:12.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you running out of time?
Do you want me to freeze time for you?

210
00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:14.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, if you could?
Could you do that for me?

211
00:09:14.565 --> 00:09:15.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can do that. I’m a time lord.

212
00:09:15.725 --> 00:09:17.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could you reset the clock or something
that they’re using.

213
00:09:17.925 --> 00:09:18.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can do this.

214
00:09:19.005 --> 00:09:19.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

215
00:09:20.805 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] Now I need
to start making the curry,

216
00:09:22.725 --> 00:09:25.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
called Kubani, which is chickpea curry.

217
00:09:26.525 --> 00:09:29.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Ruby] Something smells so good.
-Sorry.

218
00:09:29.565 --> 00:09:31.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] What’s this mound?
-Mound? Leave the mound alone.

219
00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:33.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s the mound doing? Is it resting?

220
00:09:33.725 --> 00:09:34.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s just chilling.

221
00:09:35.045 --> 00:09:37.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s like a creature. If you’re a vegan,
your mouth will be watering.

222
00:09:39.405 --> 00:09:40.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m just taking out the beans.

223
00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:44.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] Ah. Oh, no.

224
00:09:44.565 --> 00:09:45.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beans everywhere. So hot.

225
00:09:46.045 --> 00:09:47.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] Doesn't really look that good
to be honest.

226
00:09:48.045 --> 00:09:51.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can’t tell why.
I just have a feeling it looks funny.

227
00:09:51.885 --> 00:09:54.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kim-Joy] They look okay.
They’ve shrunk back a little bit more

228
00:09:54.445 --> 00:09:55.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
than they would at home.

229
00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:56.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] I’m going back in.

230
00:09:57.005 --> 00:09:59.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the second stage
of my blind baking.

231
00:09:59.525 --> 00:10:01.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So now this will help dry out the bottom,

232
00:10:01.405 --> 00:10:04.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
hopefully, now that I’ve removed
the baking beans.

233
00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:06.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are going in for, like,
another eight minutes.

234
00:10:06.925 --> 00:10:08.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How long we got left?

235
00:10:11.685 --> 00:10:13.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just need to fry my falafel.

236
00:10:13.125 --> 00:10:14.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just got some just gone in the fryer now.

237
00:10:14.885 --> 00:10:18.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They seem to be holding.
I’m making my hummus now.

238
00:10:18.205 --> 00:10:21.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is basically plum chutney.
This is tamarind paste.

239
00:10:21.525 --> 00:10:24.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like, a tiny bit.
It’s a very tart flavour.

240
00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:29.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kim-Joy] This is for the tofu part.
Just add Indian black salt.

241
00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:32.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It smells, like, you know, like, sulphur.
[laughs]

242
00:10:33.565 --> 00:10:35.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um, yeah. Gives sort of an eggyness.

243
00:10:36.325 --> 00:10:39.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have half an hour,
just half an hour.

244
00:10:40.645 --> 00:10:42.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. No, that’s mine.

245
00:10:42.325 --> 00:10:43.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Straight through.

246
00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:46.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Too hot.

247
00:10:48.045 --> 00:10:51.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So there is a bit of shrinkage.
I hope that’s cooked.

248
00:10:52.805 --> 00:10:55.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So that’s looking okay.
I think they have a bit of colour.

249
00:10:56.165 --> 00:10:57.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think that’s soggy bottom.

250
00:10:57.845 --> 00:10:59.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kim-Joy] They’re nicely brown.
The only problem is,

251
00:10:59.885 --> 00:11:01.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
like, they’re not so even.

252
00:11:01.885 --> 00:11:03.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m just going to put
the fillings in next.

253
00:11:04.805 --> 00:11:06.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Trying to make a vegan tart look pretty.

254
00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:09.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Basically, I feel they would say,
ah, it’s a bit simple

255
00:11:09.925 --> 00:11:13.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but French food is simple, right?
And it’s delicious.

256
00:11:13.245 --> 00:11:14.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] Who would have thought, eh?

257
00:11:14.165 --> 00:11:16.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could get a cheese flavour
without actual cheese.

258
00:11:16.565 --> 00:11:18.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am pleasantly surprised.

259
00:11:18.245 --> 00:11:20.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] I’m just popping in the filling,

260
00:11:20.485 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is the caramelised onion
and then in the bottom is, like,

261
00:11:23.805 --> 00:11:26.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a bit of the goats’ cheese alternative.

262
00:11:26.325 --> 00:11:29.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] This is the plum chutney
I made earlier going in now.

263
00:11:29.925 --> 00:11:34.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the Kubani
that’s going to go on the top.

264
00:11:34.685 --> 00:11:35.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are these little guys?

265
00:11:36.085 --> 00:11:38.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are mushrooms,
chestnuts and béchamel...

266
00:11:38.885 --> 00:11:39.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wow.
-little tarts.

267
00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:42.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like those little trays.
They’re like little mouse beds.

268
00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:44.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Little mice beds, yeah.

269
00:11:44.405 --> 00:11:45.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Little bed for mice.

270
00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:47.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, these are going back in.

271
00:11:49.445 --> 00:11:51.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] And back in the oven.

272
00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:54.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Those will go in probably
until a few minutes before the end.

273
00:11:54.125 --> 00:11:56.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just a little bit more.

274
00:11:56.165 --> 00:11:57.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bye-bye. [laughs]

275
00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:00.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looking okay actually.

276
00:12:01.085 --> 00:12:04.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not too bad,
but I’m really rushing it today.

277
00:12:04.285 --> 00:12:06.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I’ve done a few too many elements.

278
00:12:06.165 --> 00:12:07.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know
what’s happened to my filling.

279
00:12:07.565 --> 00:12:08.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought I’d done a lot more than that.

280
00:12:08.885 --> 00:12:12.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s supposed to be quite filled out.
I’ve literally run out of filling.

281
00:12:14.005 --> 00:12:15.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can imagine this is going to be good
for you, vegan week, no?

282
00:12:16.085 --> 00:12:18.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hopefully, yeah. I feel like everyone
keeps saying that to me.

283
00:12:19.085 --> 00:12:21.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You look like you might know your way
around a vegan restaurant.

284
00:12:22.445 --> 00:12:24.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But you’re not a vegan, are you?
-No.

285
00:12:24.445 --> 00:12:26.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, but you just have that air about you.

286
00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:27.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

287
00:12:27.565 --> 00:12:29.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jon] I don't know whether you can put
hummus back in the oven

288
00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but we’ll soon find out, won’t we?

289
00:12:30.445 --> 00:12:32.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I really don't think I’ll be getting
Star Baker this week.

290
00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:34.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Purple mashed potato.

291
00:12:34.405 --> 00:12:36.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

292
00:12:37.205 --> 00:12:39.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just 15 minutes remaining.

293
00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jon] Dropped them on the floor.

294
00:12:42.485 --> 00:12:44.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These are not even bloody cooked.

295
00:12:45.285 --> 00:12:47.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just leave them in the oven
for as long as I can go.

296
00:12:48.285 --> 00:12:49.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] Tarty.

297
00:12:50.125 --> 00:12:51.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[beeping]

298
00:12:52.365 --> 00:12:53.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good. I wanna get them out the tins

299
00:12:54.165 --> 00:12:56.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they’re just too hot
to handle at the moment.

300
00:12:56.245 --> 00:12:57.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ow. Ow. Ow.

301
00:12:57.325 --> 00:12:58.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] Ah, no, we can't do that.

302
00:12:58.965 --> 00:12:59.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Think I may have burnt my fingers.

303
00:13:00.965 --> 00:13:03.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, we just making sure
that they’re looking good.

304
00:13:03.805 --> 00:13:05.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ruby] Let’s think about
how I am going to decorate.

305
00:13:06.445 --> 00:13:07.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rahul] Just a little bit of yoghurt.

-Thanks, mate.

[Noel] Bakers, you have five minutes left.
Five minutes.

309
00:13:14.565 --> 00:13:15.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Damn it.

00:13:15.765 --> 00:13:19.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, I need to start assembling now.
It is going to be really rushed.

311
00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:22.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, coming out now
whether it’s cooked or not.

312
00:13:22.605 --> 00:13:25.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s made of acetate so it’s, like,
an invisible squirrel.

313
00:13:25.965 --> 00:13:27.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't taste the paprika too much.

00:13:27.805 --> 00:13:30.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] Just a little bit of
chopped coriander and chopped onion.

315
00:13:31.445 --> 00:13:35.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How to make something pretty.
Buy a stamp and put it on top.

316
00:13:35.845 --> 00:13:37.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] I’m just going to blowtorch them.

317
00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:40.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't really think about this.

318
00:13:40.845 --> 00:13:42.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In my head, it seemed like a great idea,

319
00:13:42.245 --> 00:13:43.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but of course, the green stuff’s burning.

320
00:13:44.245 --> 00:13:45.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jon] Pastry case is not cooked.

321
00:13:45.645 --> 00:13:47.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What’s the point of making them
look pretty if they’re inedible?

322
00:13:48.685 --> 00:13:50.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not done very well

323
00:13:50.965 --> 00:13:53.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but with all the others it will look okay.

00:13:56.245 --> 00:13:58.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have one minute.
Just one minute.

326
00:13:58.725 --> 00:13:59.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One minute?

327
00:13:59.685 --> 00:14:00.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One vegan minute.

328
00:14:29.845 --> 00:14:31.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, bakers, your time is up.

329
00:14:31.565 --> 00:14:34.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is the end
of your first vegan challenge.

330
00:14:35.645 --> 00:14:37.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. Whatever.

331
00:14:37.245 --> 00:14:39.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know what happened.
Just absolutely lost time.

332
00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:40.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the colour though.

333
00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:41.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s so beautiful.
-Oh, thank you.

334
00:14:41.445 --> 00:14:42.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Give me a plus point.
Give me a plus point.

335
00:14:42.845 --> 00:14:43.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Manon] Yes. Yes.

340
00:15:07.605 --> 00:15:09.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Manon] So we have the summer tartlet,

341
00:15:09.485 --> 00:15:10.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is ratatouille

342
00:15:11.085 --> 00:15:12.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then we have the winter tartlet,

343
00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:15.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is a vegan béchamel

344
00:15:16.565 --> 00:15:18.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It does look very attractive.

345
00:15:18.525 --> 00:15:19.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pastry looks nice and even.

346
00:15:19.965 --> 00:15:21.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s well baked all the way through.

347
00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:22.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s nice.

348
00:15:24.765 --> 00:15:26.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cuts beautifully through.

349
00:15:30.365 --> 00:15:32.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s very mild...
-[Manon] Hmm-mm, yeah.

350
00:15:32.565 --> 00:15:33.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it is very delicious.

351
00:15:34.205 --> 00:15:35.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Have you got coconut in there?

352
00:15:35.245 --> 00:15:37.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm-mm. In the pastry.

353
00:15:37.845 --> 00:15:39.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Coconut really works, doesn't it?

354
00:15:39.645 --> 00:15:41.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] That is excellent.
-[Paul] A very good pastry.

355
00:15:41.285 --> 00:15:43.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I’m glad.
-[Paul] Okay.

356
00:15:43.525 --> 00:15:45.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Let’s look at this ratatouille one.

357
00:15:45.325 --> 00:15:46.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Manon] Yes.

358
00:15:49.205 --> 00:15:51.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mm. It certainly tastes like
the south of France.

359
00:15:52.405 --> 00:15:56.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pastry’s a bit hard
but it’s good and it’s holding its shape.

360
00:15:56.445 --> 00:15:57.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overall, I think you’ve done
a very decent job.

361
00:15:58.125 --> 00:15:59.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

362
00:16:07.965 --> 00:16:09.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

363
00:16:09.125 --> 00:16:11.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shapes are identical,
which is a good start.

364
00:16:11.205 --> 00:16:12.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

365
00:16:12.645 --> 00:16:14.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] How did you get on
with the cheese mixture,

366
00:16:14.485 --> 00:16:16.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-‘cause you put in that nutritional yeast?
-Yes.

367
00:16:16.805 --> 00:16:19.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It tasted good.
Fingers crossed it comes across well.

368
00:16:24.445 --> 00:16:25.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I can taste the broccoli

369
00:16:27.205 --> 00:16:28.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I can taste the, um,

370
00:16:29.445 --> 00:16:30.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
broccoli.

371
00:16:30.565 --> 00:16:31.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

372
00:16:32.405 --> 00:16:34.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bit underwhelmed actually.
-Right, okay.

373
00:16:34.725 --> 00:16:36.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I was expecting it to have
more flavour in there.

374
00:16:36.605 --> 00:16:38.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Right, okay.
-I mean, the pastry’s nice and thin.

375
00:16:39.005 --> 00:16:40.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Ruby] Yeah.
-It’s crisp

376
00:16:40.405 --> 00:16:44.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the only thing you can really taste
is the broccoli and a bit of chilli...

377
00:16:44.325 --> 00:16:45.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-...at the back of your throat.

378
00:16:45.285 --> 00:16:46.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let’s have a go at the other one.
-Okay.

379
00:16:47.205 --> 00:16:48.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] One thing that winds me up,

380
00:16:48.765 --> 00:16:49.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
green on the top of tomato.

381
00:16:50.085 --> 00:16:51.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just thought it looked better, you know.

382
00:16:51.645 --> 00:16:53.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It looks really nice
without them anyway.

383
00:16:53.365 --> 00:16:54.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

384
00:16:57.165 --> 00:16:58.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. Quite sweet.

385
00:16:58.645 --> 00:16:59.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And chilli.

386
00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:00.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just a little bit.

387
00:17:00.805 --> 00:17:02.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs] I think a bit more
than a little bit.

388
00:17:02.365 --> 00:17:03.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I honestly... I only put in just a touch.

389
00:17:03.925 --> 00:17:05.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was, like,
I don't want to go in too much.

390
00:17:05.645 --> 00:17:07.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think overall I get the sage.

391
00:17:07.325 --> 00:17:08.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-I get that bit of heat and then

392
00:17:09.205 --> 00:17:10.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-nothing much else.
-Okay.

393
00:17:10.604 --> 00:17:11.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s fine.

394
00:17:19.645 --> 00:17:21.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rahul] This one is like a pesto.

395
00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:26.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s just garlic, coriander leaf,
cashew nut and poppy seed paste.

396
00:17:29.805 --> 00:17:32.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely pastry. Very good flavours.

397
00:17:32.205 --> 00:17:34.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I wouldn't have put
that much filling in.

398
00:17:34.445 --> 00:17:36.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe even half
that would have been plenty.

399
00:17:37.285 --> 00:17:39.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, let’s try this one now shall we?

400
00:17:39.645 --> 00:17:41.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] This one is a ghugni chaat,

401
00:17:41.725 --> 00:17:43.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is chickpea curry
and underneath there is a plum chutney

402
00:17:44.045 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and caramelised onions.

403
00:17:46.605 --> 00:17:48.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] You can see the pastry is crumbly

404
00:17:48.645 --> 00:17:51.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it’s holding together,
which is really the difficult thing.

405
00:17:51.565 --> 00:17:52.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

406
00:17:56.925 --> 00:17:58.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fantastic.

407
00:17:59.685 --> 00:18:00.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Poetry.

408
00:18:01.005 --> 00:18:01.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

00:18:01.925 --> 00:18:03.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] "Poetry"?

410
00:18:04.085 --> 00:18:06.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. Poetry.

411
00:18:06.405 --> 00:18:07.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm.

It’s so delicate.
The pastry melts in the mouth.

413
00:18:10.285 --> 00:18:13.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Crispy. And a little hint of spice
in there as well.

414
00:18:13.205 --> 00:18:15.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the filling with the chickpea
is fantastic.

415
00:18:15.805 --> 00:18:17.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very clever.
-Who would have thought that was vegan?

416
00:18:17.725 --> 00:18:20.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s almost buttery. It’s so delicious.

417
00:18:20.685 --> 00:18:21.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is. Thank you, Rahul.
-Thank you.

418
00:18:22.045 --> 00:18:23.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks a lot. Thank you.
-[whispering] She said, "Poetry".

419
00:18:24.085 --> 00:18:25.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have some.

420
00:18:26.365 --> 00:18:30.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rahul, do... do a dance or something.
Go on.

421
00:18:30.685 --> 00:18:32.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rahul. Rahul.

422
00:18:42.565 --> 00:18:44.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Just feels a bit flexible.
-Oh.

423
00:18:44.645 --> 00:18:45.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Flexible?
-Yeah.

424
00:18:46.045 --> 00:18:46.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flexible pastry.

425
00:18:47.605 --> 00:18:48.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I’m thinking rubbery pastry.

426
00:18:48.845 --> 00:18:50.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, no.
-[Noel] Flexible tartlets.

427
00:18:51.125 --> 00:18:52.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Looks like it’s been overworked.

428
00:18:54.685 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s so weird, the veg on the top is veg

429
00:18:56.925 --> 00:18:58.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but then you’ve got this apple underneath,

430
00:18:58.845 --> 00:19:01.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which makes it sweet,
so no matter what you put on the top,

431
00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:03.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-the apple will always win.
-Okay.

432
00:19:03.605 --> 00:19:04.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It’s an apple pie.

433
00:19:04.525 --> 00:19:06.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dollop of crème fraiche
and it would be delicious.

434
00:19:06.525 --> 00:19:08.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh... sorry.

435
00:19:08.445 --> 00:19:10.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] This looks better.
This is the poppy seed.

436
00:19:10.325 --> 00:19:12.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Gives it a bit of colour too.
-Yeah, it does.

437
00:19:15.485 --> 00:19:18.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very nice and thin pastry.
I mean, that’s amazing.

438
00:19:21.965 --> 00:19:24.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The onions are the sort
of the ones you put on a hot dog.

439
00:19:24.165 --> 00:19:25.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

440
00:19:25.085 --> 00:19:26.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the overall flavour
actually is all right.

441
00:19:26.845 --> 00:19:28.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-I quite like the flavour.

442
00:19:28.085 --> 00:19:30.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the flavour’s lovely.
I think there’s too much onion.

443
00:19:30.605 --> 00:19:32.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. Can I ask about the rubbery
on the flexible?

444
00:19:32.965 --> 00:19:34.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was it rubbery or was it okay?

445
00:19:34.125 --> 00:19:35.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, the pastry on that
was all right.

446
00:19:35.165 --> 00:19:36.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Good.

447
00:19:36.125 --> 00:19:37.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Were your flexible alarm bells ringing?

448
00:19:38.725 --> 00:19:39.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

449
00:19:46.245 --> 00:19:47.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Where’s the rest of it?

450
00:19:47.405 --> 00:19:51.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh, I ran out of filling and I drastically
ran out of time as well.

451
00:19:51.725 --> 00:19:52.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I can see that.

452
00:19:52.845 --> 00:19:53.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jon] Quite unfinished.

453
00:19:54.085 --> 00:19:55.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It’s a bit undercooked under there.

454
00:19:55.885 --> 00:19:56.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

455
00:19:56.845 --> 00:19:58.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, let’s have a look.
They are a little bit untidy

456
00:19:59.005 --> 00:20:01.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because they’re not full
and maybe you chose the wrong size.

457
00:20:01.725 --> 00:20:03.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] They do look a bit of a mess.

458
00:20:07.525 --> 00:20:08.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul laughs]

459
00:20:08.725 --> 00:20:09.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It’s a bit gluey.

460
00:20:10.205 --> 00:20:11.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is very rubbery, the pastry.

461
00:20:11.725 --> 00:20:14.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s the flavour of the tomatoes
I don't particularly like,

462
00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:15.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-it’s very artificial.
-It’s just too heavy.

463
00:20:16.885 --> 00:20:19.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It’s not good.
Let’s have a look at the falafel.

464
00:20:19.205 --> 00:20:20.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Base isn’t too bad.

465
00:20:20.765 --> 00:20:23.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Again, it doesn't look
wonderfully attractive, does it?

466
00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:28.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I quite like the flavour of the falafel.

467
00:20:28.365 --> 00:20:30.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pastry’s still a little bit rubbery.

468
00:20:30.845 --> 00:20:34.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The potato adding to it doesn't really
bring a lot, just a little bit of colour.

469
00:20:34.405 --> 00:20:36.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s not bad. It’s all right, you know.

470
00:20:36.645 --> 00:20:38.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Both the flavours are good but too strong.

471
00:20:39.245 --> 00:20:43.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But also the pastry’s very pale
and it’s really untidy.

472
00:20:43.565 --> 00:20:45.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This has caught you out a little bit.
It’s not your thing, is it?

473
00:20:45.805 --> 00:20:48.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It’s not my thing at all.
I will admit to that.

474
00:20:55.885 --> 00:20:56.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It’s very, uh, neat.

475
00:20:57.485 --> 00:20:59.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very artistic. Baked well.

476
00:20:59.765 --> 00:21:00.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Nice colour.

477
00:21:02.885 --> 00:21:05.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s quite nice the, um, layers.

478
00:21:10.365 --> 00:21:12.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The coconut pastry.

479
00:21:13.245 --> 00:21:15.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s amazing.
I think the flavour’s are great.

480
00:21:15.365 --> 00:21:18.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ve got the cooling that comes
from the tofu before you hit the onion.

481
00:21:18.405 --> 00:21:20.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s absolutely delicious.

482
00:21:20.165 --> 00:21:21.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’d never have said
that would have gone together.

483
00:21:22.045 --> 00:21:22.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I like that one.

484
00:21:22.965 --> 00:21:23.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, thank you.

485
00:21:24.045 --> 00:21:24.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Remind me of this one again?

486
00:21:25.085 --> 00:21:29.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Um, so that’s got tofu, broccoli,
onion, the tomato on top.

487
00:21:29.525 --> 00:21:31.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s got a bit of Indian black salt
for the eggyness.

488
00:21:33.365 --> 00:21:34.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s delicious.

489
00:21:34.325 --> 00:21:36.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The balance of flavour is very good.

490
00:21:36.445 --> 00:21:38.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Again, the tofu is bringing
that little bit of

491
00:21:38.725 --> 00:21:41.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
coolness to it
and the pastry’s flaky, it’s buttery.

492
00:21:41.765 --> 00:21:43.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Very good job on both of them.

493
00:21:43.885 --> 00:21:45.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very good job. Looks good.
-Thank you.

494
00:21:45.485 --> 00:21:46.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, uh...

495
00:21:46.525 --> 00:21:47.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On vegan week?

496
00:21:47.885 --> 00:21:49.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go on, go on, go on.

497
00:21:50.205 --> 00:21:51.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s really good. Well done.

498
00:21:51.885 --> 00:21:53.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. I can’t believe that.

499
00:21:53.965 --> 00:21:57.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s good. If anyone was gonna pull off
vegan week, it was you.

500
00:21:57.245 --> 00:21:58.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

501
00:21:58.965 --> 00:21:59.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my gosh.

502

503
00:22:02.725 --> 00:22:07.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Its more than relief after that.
It’s extreme joy. [laughs]

pick yourself up and carry on.

Hi, bakers. Welcome back
to your technical challenge,

[Noel] So for your
technical challenge today,

518
00:22:50.805 --> 00:22:55.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue would love you to make
a vegan tropical fruit pavlova.

519
00:22:55.365 --> 00:22:56.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] The judges will be looking for two

520
00:22:57.005 --> 00:23:00.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
perfectly piped vegan meringue discs.

521
00:23:00.205 --> 00:23:01.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No egg whites.
-Yeah.

522
00:23:01.605 --> 00:23:04.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sandwiched and topped with
coconut pastry cream and tropical fruit.

523
00:23:04.845 --> 00:23:07.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The meringue must be crispy on the outside

524
00:23:08.005 --> 00:23:10.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but also kind of marshmallow-ey
on the inside.

525
00:23:10.165 --> 00:23:11.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, lovely.

526
00:23:11.205 --> 00:23:13.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ve got two and a half hours
to complete this challenge.

528
00:23:14.605 --> 00:23:15.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:15.645 --> 00:23:16.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Manon] Okay, we’re in business.

530
00:23:17.285 --> 00:23:18.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jon] I’ve made a pavlova.

531
00:23:18.445 --> 00:23:20.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never made a vegan pavlova.

532
00:23:20.125 --> 00:23:22.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Little bit out of my comfort zone
with this, but there we go.

out of aquafaba before

538
00:23:36.405 --> 00:23:37.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:38.845 --> 00:23:41.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

540
00:23:41.165 --> 00:23:42.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

541
00:23:42.925 --> 00:23:47.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you can’t use any egg whites
so they’ve been given aquafaba.

542
00:23:47.445 --> 00:23:48.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

543
00:23:48.485 --> 00:23:50.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It actually works like meringue

544
00:23:50.485 --> 00:23:53.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but takes longer to whisk it
to a stiff peak.

545
00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:56.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The other great difference between this
and egg white based meringue

546
00:23:56.685 --> 00:23:58.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is that this is much more fragile.

547
00:23:58.605 --> 00:24:00.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It actually cuts a little bit
like a traditional meringue.

548
00:24:00.925 --> 00:24:02.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice and light.

549
00:24:02.285 --> 00:24:03.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Right.

550
00:24:04.445 --> 00:24:05.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The meringue is different.

551
00:24:05.805 --> 00:24:06.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:07.125 --> 00:24:10.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Melts in the mouth.

554
00:24:11.485 --> 00:24:12.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s hope they rise to it.

555
00:24:14.165 --> 00:24:16.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

556

I’m sure it’s gonna taste everything
but chickpea.

558
00:24:25.725 --> 00:24:27.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

560
00:24:29.525 --> 00:24:31.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] I like chickpeas
in their own right...

561
00:24:31.365 --> 00:24:32.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Well, then...

562
00:24:32.405 --> 00:24:34.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
...but when they pretend
to be meringue, I’m not sure.

563
00:24:35.885 --> 00:24:37.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ruby] I find it amazing
that someone sat there and thought,

564
00:24:38.045 --> 00:24:40.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m gonna whisk the hell
out of some chickpea juice today.

565
00:24:40.485 --> 00:24:43.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] I have never tried it before
so I’m not sure yet.

566
00:24:43.925 --> 00:24:47.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Increase the speed to high

00:24:47.165 --> 00:24:49.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Briony] I’ve just added the sugar
one tablespoon at a time.

568
00:24:49.965 --> 00:24:51.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know enough about it to know

569
00:24:51.565 --> 00:24:54.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
whether you can over or under whisk it,
like eggs.

570
00:24:54.165 --> 00:24:56.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you bring in
a normal meringue stiff peaks,

571
00:24:56.405 --> 00:24:58.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you can tip the bowl over your head.

572
00:24:58.165 --> 00:25:00.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Essentially, you should be able
to do the same with the aquafaba.

573
00:25:03.205 --> 00:25:04.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s meringue consistency.

574
00:25:05.885 --> 00:25:07.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m pretty happy.
It’s quite thick and glossy.

575
00:25:07.925 --> 00:25:11.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is peaked but it was, like,
peakier before.

576
00:25:11.645 --> 00:25:13.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I don't know if I overdid it a bit?

577
00:25:14.405 --> 00:25:15.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s holding its shape.

578
00:25:16.125 --> 00:25:17.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good sign.

579
00:25:17.525 --> 00:25:18.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m gonna do it again.

580
00:25:19.445 --> 00:25:20.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It won't take too long.

581
00:25:22.645 --> 00:25:25.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Then you have to spoon the mixture

00:25:26.325 --> 00:25:29.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

with a decorative edge."

584
00:25:29.605 --> 00:25:31.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, let’s see what this pipe’s like.

585
00:25:31.445 --> 00:25:33.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Doesn't look like bean water at all.

586
00:25:33.685 --> 00:25:34.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Manon] Um...

587
00:25:35.885 --> 00:25:38.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it seems all right.
It could maybe be a bit stiffer

588
00:25:38.085 --> 00:25:39.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I think that's the thing
with aquafaba.

589
00:25:39.965 --> 00:25:41.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It feels pretty much the same
if I’m being honest,

590
00:25:41.965 --> 00:25:43.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as a normal meringue.

591
00:25:43.205 --> 00:25:44.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't really know
what do to with the edges.

592
00:25:47.565 --> 00:25:49.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not the easiest stuff to work with.

593
00:25:51.365 --> 00:25:53.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know what?
Who doesn't like a little bit of spikey.

594
00:25:54.925 --> 00:25:57.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kim-Joy] That’ll do.
I just want to pipe it now.

595
00:25:57.085 --> 00:26:00.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just can’t do technicals.
I really hate it.

596
00:26:00.925 --> 00:26:03.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Now we’re gonna put it in the oven.

597
00:26:04.085 --> 00:26:06.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The instructions say,
"Bake till crisp and dry

598
00:26:06.965 --> 00:26:09.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and remove from the oven
and dry it completely."

599
00:26:09.245 --> 00:26:12.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Meringue needs to cook for a long time
on a low heat.

600
00:26:13.005 --> 00:26:15.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Definitely baking it
for about an hour, minimum.

601
00:26:16.005 --> 00:26:18.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m putting it for one hour.

602
00:26:18.565 --> 00:26:20.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It might even take longer.

603
00:26:20.285 --> 00:26:23.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My meringues for the aquafaba,
I do for 75 minutes.

604
00:26:23.925 --> 00:26:26.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They want it crispy on the outside
and soft in the middle.

605
00:26:27.245 --> 00:26:30.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kim-Joy] I don't actually know how long
to bake a vegan pavlova for.

606
00:26:30.805 --> 00:26:32.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the same
as a normal meringue I think.

607
00:26:32.485 --> 00:26:35.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Um, I’m just gonna follow
what everyone else does.

608
00:26:35.325 --> 00:26:37.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it’s a pretty tough
challenge they've done.

609
00:26:41.405 --> 00:26:43.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

You’ve got an hour and a half.

00:26:50.685 --> 00:26:52.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:04.005 --> 00:28:06.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I might just turn the oven off
and let it dry out in there.

642
00:28:07.845 --> 00:28:10.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:16.805 --> 00:28:19.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

does it?

647
00:28:19.365 --> 00:28:20.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

648
00:28:21.605 --> 00:28:23.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:23.725 --> 00:28:25.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe it needs a bit more crisping.

00:28:30.485 --> 00:28:32.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

653
00:28:32.325 --> 00:28:33.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

654
00:28:34.085 --> 00:28:37.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m a bit worried, actually,
because it has to set and it’s quite hot.

655
00:28:37.285 --> 00:28:39.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

pretty faster now.

00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:41.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:41.885 --> 00:28:44.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

It’s a pavlova.

658
00:28:44.165 --> 00:28:46.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:49.485 --> 00:28:50.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:51.165 --> 00:28:53.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:04.365 --> 00:29:05.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:15.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:16.925 --> 00:29:19.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

725
00:31:40.725 --> 00:31:41.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Marshmallow-ey inside.

726
00:31:42.285 --> 00:31:44.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crispy on the outside. I like that one.

727
00:31:44.645 --> 00:31:46.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A lot of textures going on in that one.
It’s very neat.

728
00:31:47.085 --> 00:31:49.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, this next one again, the--
Lazy with the piping again.

729
00:31:50.045 --> 00:31:53.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s cracked a bit there.
There is definition there though.

730
00:31:55.685 --> 00:31:57.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Pastry cream
is absolutely delicious.

731
00:31:58.005 --> 00:32:01.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s very runny though.
It does mean the meringue will soften.

732
00:32:01.845 --> 00:32:05.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, moving on. Lost a little bit
of definition on the bottom.

733
00:32:05.765 --> 00:32:06.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yeah. I quite like the way

734
00:32:07.045 --> 00:32:09.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the baker has thought about making one
bigger than the other.

735
00:32:11.725 --> 00:32:14.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Meringue’s good. Crispy. Marshmallow-ey.

736
00:32:14.965 --> 00:32:16.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I love the definition in this one.
-[Prue] Yeah.

737
00:32:16.645 --> 00:32:18.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Nice and equal. Hardly any cracks.

738
00:32:19.845 --> 00:32:20.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s have a look in this.

739
00:32:24.165 --> 00:32:27.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The meringue’s cooked well.
It is very full. Colourful as well.

740
00:32:28.285 --> 00:32:29.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Moving onto this last one.

741
00:32:29.405 --> 00:32:31.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Good attempt at trying to create
something a little bit different

742
00:32:31.725 --> 00:32:33.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they’ve lost the definition,
haven’t they?

743
00:32:33.725 --> 00:32:35.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] However,
it still looks rather nice.

744
00:32:35.325 --> 00:32:36.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Right.

745
00:32:37.485 --> 00:32:38.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The meringue’s very good.

746
00:32:38.405 --> 00:32:40.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s actually quite well cooked
all the way through as well.

747
00:32:40.445 --> 00:32:42.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s nice, isn’t it?
-Very nice.

748
00:32:42.725 --> 00:32:46.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>Prue and Paul will now rank</i>

749
00:32:47.205 --> 00:32:49.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In sixth place is this one.

751
00:32:51.525 --> 00:32:54.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kim-Joy, it was just a little bit boring
on the piping.

752
00:32:54.245 --> 00:32:55.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

754
00:32:57.125 --> 00:32:59.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Briony, it’s all a little bit flat.
-Yeah.

779
00:34:11.405 --> 00:34:12.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:34:14.845 --> 00:34:18.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:35:44.925 --> 00:35:47.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:35:55.085 --> 00:35:57.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:38:53.925 --> 00:38:56.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:38:56.325 --> 00:38:57.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:39:00.325 --> 00:39:01.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:39:01.925 --> 00:39:03.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:39:40.325 --> 00:39:43.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:41:06.965 --> 00:41:08.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

940
00:41:08.405 --> 00:41:10.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:41:10.165 --> 00:41:11.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:41:11.365 --> 00:41:13.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

950
00:41:29.885 --> 00:41:32.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, so I have dowels in there
because obviously it’s quite a tall cake,

00:41:32.405 --> 00:41:34.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

954
00:41:39.005 --> 00:41:40.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:41:41.045 --> 00:41:43.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

There is little cracks on the top

00:41:43.845 --> 00:41:46.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

so I can’t change it.

957
00:41:46.245 --> 00:41:49.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

958
00:41:49.605 --> 00:41:52.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

They have had a little bit of a rise,

959
00:41:52.165 --> 00:41:54.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is what we were looking for.

960
00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:55.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

962
00:41:58.365 --> 00:42:00.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is baked. And look, it’s really spongy.

963
00:42:01.605 --> 00:42:02.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's proper cake.

964
00:42:04.045 --> 00:42:05.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It holds quite nicely

965
00:42:05.245 --> 00:42:07.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so it’s quite moist
but it’s not too stodgy.

966
00:42:09.765 --> 00:42:10.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:42:14.965 --> 00:42:16.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:43:30.005 --> 00:43:33.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So this is my favourite moment,
decorating and icing the cake.

1001
00:43:33.605 --> 00:43:36.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ruby] I’m drenching
my sponges in a sugar syrup.

1002
00:43:36.525 --> 00:43:38.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s a good way to keep your cakes moist.

1003
00:43:38.365 --> 00:43:40.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] I think the cake
should be quite moist anyway

1004
00:43:40.725 --> 00:43:43.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but obviously the chocolate doesn’t have
any coconut flavouring in it,

1005
00:43:43.805 --> 00:43:46.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so this is like a sugar water
and coconut extract.

1006
00:43:46.925 --> 00:43:48.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Briony] I’m putting the jam
in between each layer

1007
00:43:48.765 --> 00:43:50.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then there'll be ganache
around the outside.

1008
00:43:50.965 --> 00:43:54.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jon] I’m just sort of pipping
circles of buttercream around

1009
00:43:54.325 --> 00:43:56.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then I’m pouring orange curd in

1010
00:43:56.645 --> 00:43:57.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it’s nowhere near set,

1011
00:43:57.965 --> 00:43:59.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so hopefully the buttercream
will keep it in there.

1012
00:43:59.965 --> 00:44:02.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Buttercream’s a bit
too stiff at the minute.

1013
00:44:02.485 --> 00:44:03.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] This is a vegan ganache.

1014
00:44:03.925 --> 00:44:07.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it is vegan dark chocolate
with a coconut cream.

1015
00:44:07.525 --> 00:44:10.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kim-Joy] Just gotta get it
nice and smooth as possible.

1016
00:44:10.685 --> 00:44:12.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m doing that sort of,
like, semi-naked cake.

1017
00:44:12.885 --> 00:44:15.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love naked cake.
I think it looks really cool.

1018
00:44:15.485 --> 00:44:16.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] That isn’t looking pretty.

1019
00:44:17.165 --> 00:44:19.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It broke when I was icing it.

1020
00:44:19.525 --> 00:44:21.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I’m just gonna take it off.

00:44:23.245 --> 00:44:24.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:44:24.525 --> 00:44:26.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I just want to crush these.

I just need to try. That’s it.

1042
00:45:16.085 --> 00:45:16.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1057
00:45:51.205 --> 00:45:52.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1063
00:46:00.845 --> 00:46:01.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:49:20.685 --> 00:49:23.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The orange in there is really nice
and sharp, carries it through.

1138
00:49:24.085 --> 00:49:27.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, it looks hideous,
but the flavour of it is, um, very good.

1139
00:49:27.445 --> 00:49:28.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. Cheers.

1140
00:49:28.605 --> 00:49:31.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me, there’s a bit too much orange curd
but I think it’s a good cake.

1141
00:49:31.845 --> 00:49:32.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1142
00:49:46.205 --> 00:49:47.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It’s absolutely beautiful.

1143
00:49:47.565 --> 00:49:50.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very delicately done.
The naked cake is perfect.

1144
00:49:50.725 --> 00:49:52.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you get it right, Manon,
you really get it right, don't ya?

1145
00:49:53.485 --> 00:49:54.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Let’s have a look inside shall we?

1146
00:49:57.005 --> 00:49:58.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very neat coming out.

1147
00:49:58.525 --> 00:49:59.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Looks a bit pudding-ey.

1148
00:49:59.685 --> 00:50:00.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It does, doesn't it?

1149
00:50:07.005 --> 00:50:08.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s really heavy.

1150
00:50:08.445 --> 00:50:09.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1151
00:50:09.445 --> 00:50:10.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Gluey.

1152
00:50:11.405 --> 00:50:13.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s not good. Looks great, tastes awful.

1153
00:50:13.605 --> 00:50:14.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, really?

1154
00:50:14.805 --> 00:50:18.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is like an under-baked cake
and it’s quite rubbery as well, actually.

1155
00:50:18.405 --> 00:50:20.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s like it’s been overworked.
It’s been over-mixed.

1156
00:50:20.325 --> 00:50:21.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Apple, I’m certainly not getting.

1157
00:50:22.365 --> 00:50:23.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s not a good cake at all.

1158
00:50:24.565 --> 00:50:25.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
That’s a shame.

1159
00:50:34.525 --> 00:50:35.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the colours.

1160
00:50:35.805 --> 00:50:38.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think they’re very pretty
and subtle and unusual.

1161
00:50:39.125 --> 00:50:41.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I was to relate a cake
to anyone in this tent,

1162
00:50:41.285 --> 00:50:43.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’d certainly relate this cake to you.

1163
00:50:43.965 --> 00:50:45.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The decoration is exquisite.

1164
00:50:45.965 --> 00:50:48.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ve gone to the trouble
of making biscuits too.

1165
00:50:48.565 --> 00:50:50.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s standing up.
I think it’s a nice looking cake.

1166
00:50:51.045 --> 00:50:51.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1167
00:50:51.965 --> 00:50:53.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Now, this is lavender sponge?
-Yes.

1168
00:50:56.485 --> 00:50:57.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very good.

1169
00:51:04.365 --> 00:51:05.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm.

1170
00:51:05.925 --> 00:51:07.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite powerful lavender.

1171
00:51:10.445 --> 00:51:11.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s very pudding like, isn’t it?

1172
00:51:11.725 --> 00:51:12.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Hmm.

1173
00:51:12.685 --> 00:51:15.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] But nevertheless,
I think the balance between lavender,

1174
00:51:15.325 --> 00:51:16.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is very brave of you to do...

1175
00:51:16.365 --> 00:51:17.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Phew.
-and the lemon,

1176
00:51:17.845 --> 00:51:20.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is again quite sharp,
works together very well.

1177
00:51:21.405 --> 00:51:23.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well done. I think
that’s a really nice cake.

1178
00:51:23.245 --> 00:51:24.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ah, thank you very much.
-[Prue] Well done, Kim-Joy.

1179
00:51:34.205 --> 00:51:35.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

1180
00:51:37.245 --> 00:51:38.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened?

1181
00:51:38.245 --> 00:51:40.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I constructed them,
it was standing okay,

1182
00:51:40.885 --> 00:51:42.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then I put it in the fridge,
and then I left,

1183
00:51:42.565 --> 00:51:44.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and when I come back it was...

1184
00:51:44.445 --> 00:51:45.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay, let’s have a look at it.

1185
00:51:48.645 --> 00:51:51.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I might not put the drizzle as well
because I put a coconut drizzle,

1186
00:51:51.645 --> 00:51:53.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which might have actually softened
the whole thing up.

1187
00:51:53.965 --> 00:51:57.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I think I can see your problem.
I think it could be the drizzle.

1188
00:51:57.165 --> 00:51:58.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s the drizzle,
it just makes it really soggy, yeah.

1189
00:51:59.085 --> 00:51:59.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s weakened the whole thing

1190
00:52:00.525 --> 00:52:02.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you can see
where it’s compressed in the middle

1191
00:52:02.565 --> 00:52:04.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and the whole things just given way.
-Collapsed. Yeah.

1192
00:52:09.445 --> 00:52:10.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The chocolate is good. The coconut one

1193
00:52:11.005 --> 00:52:12.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
has just been drenched. It’s too much.

1194
00:52:12.965 --> 00:52:15.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It actually tastes
of too much coconut too.

1195
00:52:15.285 --> 00:52:17.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re trying too hard
to get too much flavour

1196
00:52:17.925 --> 00:52:19.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
into something that was already big.

1197
00:52:19.845 --> 00:52:21.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You had enough flavour in there
without any drizzle.

1198
00:52:21.605 --> 00:52:22.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That is a pity.

1199
00:52:32.605 --> 00:52:34.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s gonna be a bit difficult
to put the best side forward.

1200
00:52:34.565 --> 00:52:36.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So let’s go that way.

1201
00:52:40.965 --> 00:52:42.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because it’s a collapsed mess,

1202
00:52:42.565 --> 00:52:45.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it looks... I mean,
it looks like a disaster.

1203
00:52:45.605 --> 00:52:46.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Right.

1204
00:52:47.285 --> 00:52:48.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had to put in quite
a few dowels at the end,

1205
00:52:48.805 --> 00:52:50.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so you’ll probably hit a lot of, uh...

1206
00:52:51.085 --> 00:52:51.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Wow.

1207
00:52:52.965 --> 00:52:53.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
More dowel than cake.

1208
00:52:54.045 --> 00:52:54.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

1209
00:52:59.245 --> 00:53:01.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you envisage them being eaten together?

1210
00:53:01.805 --> 00:53:03.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No. Either the chocolate or the lemon.
-Right.

1211
00:53:08.325 --> 00:53:09.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm.

1212
00:53:10.565 --> 00:53:11.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like that.

1213
00:53:12.125 --> 00:53:14.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lemon-ey. Coconut-ey. Delicious.

1214
00:53:18.805 --> 00:53:20.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um, I like the lemon cake.

1215
00:53:20.525 --> 00:53:22.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the flavour of the raspberries
in there as well

1216
00:53:22.965 --> 00:53:24.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and actually I like the chocolate one too.

1217
00:53:24.965 --> 00:53:26.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They’re actually both very good cakes.

1218
00:53:26.725 --> 00:53:27.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you got it the wrong way round.

1219
00:53:27.805 --> 00:53:28.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1220
00:53:28.725 --> 00:53:29.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think if you’d put the chocolate,

1221
00:53:29.645 --> 00:53:31.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is a lot more stable
than the lemon...

1222
00:53:31.405 --> 00:53:32.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-underneath,

1223
00:53:32.325 --> 00:53:33.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it would have been fine.

1224
00:53:33.365 --> 00:53:35.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I think the sponge in the lemon one,
it was really soft.

1225
00:53:35.805 --> 00:53:36.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it was just a, uh,

1226
00:53:37.485 --> 00:53:38.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
bad judgment.

1227
00:53:38.765 --> 00:53:40.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I’m scraping at the positives</i>
<i>at the minute.</i>

1228
00:53:41.165 --> 00:53:43.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m in very dangerous territory.

1229
00:53:53.485 --> 00:53:56.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Vegan week. I mean, Paul,
you weren’t happy before we started.

1230
00:53:56.325 --> 00:53:57.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do you feel now?

1231
00:53:57.245 --> 00:53:58.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A bit disappointed with people.

1232
00:53:58.525 --> 00:53:59.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Mainly Manon.</i>

1233
00:53:59.645 --> 00:54:02.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was an awful cake
and yet it was exquisite to look at.

1234
00:54:03.005 --> 00:54:05.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, so is it going to be
that the look is one thing

1235
00:54:05.805 --> 00:54:08.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the taste is the paramount thing
because Ruby’s...

1236
00:54:08.485 --> 00:54:12.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Exactly. I would have given Ruby’s
higher marks than Manon’s

1237
00:54:12.885 --> 00:54:15.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because Ruby’s was edible.
It was delicious.

1238
00:54:15.165 --> 00:54:18.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] But you can’t discount her
from the possibility of leaving us.

1239
00:54:18.405 --> 00:54:20.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>At the end of the day, it fell,</i>
<i>and it was her fault.</i>

1240
00:54:20.845 --> 00:54:23.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think we’ve got a real problem
with the judging.

Coming into the Showstopper,
we’d put Briony, Ruby,

1242
00:54:27.765 --> 00:54:30.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jon and obviously, you had to put
Kim-Joy in there

1243
00:54:30.525 --> 00:54:31.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because she came last in the technical,

1244
00:54:31.765 --> 00:54:32.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in a little bit of trouble.

1245
00:54:32.965 --> 00:54:35.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Briony’s saved herself</i>

1246
00:54:35.645 --> 00:54:37.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The hazelnut, the mocha.
It was a very neat looking cake.

1247
00:54:38.205 --> 00:54:40.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

<i>We put Rahul and Manon up for Star Baker.</i>

1249
00:54:43.525 --> 00:54:44.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But Rahul has had a hideous...

1250
00:54:45.285 --> 00:54:47.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you’d say that
but actually his cake,

1251
00:54:47.725 --> 00:54:49.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the flavour, actually wasn't that bad.

1252
00:54:49.445 --> 00:54:53.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At the same time, I have to put Kim-Joy up
as Star Baker as well.

1253
00:54:53.685 --> 00:54:55.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Her fox cake looked great
so I thought.

1254
00:54:55.405 --> 00:54:56.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Beautiful colours.
-And you know what, the flavour was good.

1255
00:54:57.165 --> 00:54:59.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I think what you’re looking at, Kim-Joy

1256
00:54:59.445 --> 00:55:03.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I would say, you have to say Rahul
still up for Star Baker.

1257
00:55:03.165 --> 00:55:04.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I would say Ruby and Jon...

1258
00:55:04.965 --> 00:55:06.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Well, well done, bakers.
Really successful vegan week.

[Noel] Ironically, the Star Baker

1261
00:55:22.965 --> 00:55:25.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is someone who brought animals

1262
00:55:26.685 --> 00:55:29.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but in a whimsical, colourful way.

1263
00:55:29.885 --> 00:55:32.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Star baker this week is Kim-Joy.

1264
00:55:35.605 --> 00:55:36.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1266
00:55:40.205 --> 00:55:41.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah.

1267
00:55:43.565 --> 00:55:44.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1268
00:55:46.125 --> 00:55:49.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to say this gets
tougher and tougher

1269
00:55:49.125 --> 00:55:53.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:55:53.605 --> 00:55:55.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it is a really a horrible job.

00:55:56.165 --> 00:56:00.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

who’s going home is...

1272
00:56:10.325 --> 00:56:11.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jon.

1273
00:56:11.845 --> 00:56:12.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m so sorry.

I was immensely proud.

00:56:21.085 --> 00:56:23.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But to make it to week seven,
absolutely amazing.

1279

Star baker of vegan week.
I can’t believe I’m saying those words.

the best on vegan week.
