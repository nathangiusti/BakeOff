00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's important in life
to conclude things properly.

Don't you agree, Noel?

6
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't talk. I'm a tiger.

8
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Er, we're re-enacting the <i>Life of Pi</i>.
-What?

9
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

14
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's a bit of a triumph.

We've gone the wrong way.

17
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's so jarring.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

19
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's an amazing construction.

24
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm having a bit of a problem.

26
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've just realised, actually,
there's only two guys left.

27
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Mmm, I don't mind.

28
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

30
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
and now it's here,
I'm a little bit anxious.

31
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Pastry can smell fear, 100 per cent.

32
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Morning, bakers,
welcome to pasty week.

33
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, it's pastry week. Yeah.
-Is it?

34
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was looking forward to pasty week,
being a goth and all that.

35
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Yeah, anyway,
for your Signature Challenge,

36
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul and Prue,
would like you to make savoury pies.

37
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, the flavour
of the filling is entirely up to you.

38
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] You have to make four pies,

39
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the judges would love
to see how you fashion shortcrust.

40
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They have to be beautifully decorated.

41
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Think designer pies,
the Coco Chanel of shortcrust.

42
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, you've got two and a half hours
to make your four gorgeous pies.

43
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks.
-Get set.

44
00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake.

45
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, let's get cracking.
Cutting my butter as quick as possible,

46
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want the maximum amount of time
to decorate my pie.

47
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] It is quite a challenge, you have
to come up with all this decoration,

48
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then on top of that,
you've got to have good pastry.

49
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't do it to time
last time I practised it.

50
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] <i>They've got to make</i>
<i>four individual savoury pies, </i>

51
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they must be connected
in some way through the decoration.

52
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all about that little bit of work
with the knife

53
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the egg wash to create something
that looks amazing.

54
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Intricate pastry work
takes a lot of skill,

55
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>and there's a temptation to keep</i>

56
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
fiddling around
with these tiny little bits of pastry,

57
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>and of course the more you fiddle,</i>

58
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the tougher it gets
and it loses its crumbly deliciousness.

59
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] <i>The pies might look amazing</i>

60
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but when you put that fork in
and put it in your mouth,

61
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's got to flake,
it's got to taste buttery,

62
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then you look forward to that filling.

63
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've got to think of not just
the outside, but also the filling too.

64
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Hello, Yan.
-Hello.

65
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what have you decided
to do for the savoury pie challenge?

66
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The theme of my pie is science,

67
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's based on
British scientists.

68
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay. Er...
-The nerd pie.

69
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, it's fine.
-This is a nerd pie.

70
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Geek pie.

[Sandi] <i>Steven Hawking, Charles Darwin,</i>
<i>Alan Turing, and Franklin and Crick</i>

[Yan] For the Turing pie,
I'm cutting out binary code,

74
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
ones and zeros sealing the pie.

75
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ah!
-Around the, um, DNA helix...

76
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm plaiting so it looks like a DNA helix,
and then, and then pushing it down.

77
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That decoration alone would take me a day.

78
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Almost more difficult
than splitting the atom.

79
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Done, 400.

81
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Every themed signature pie</i>

82
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] Shortcrust is three ingredients,
plain flour, butter, lard.

83
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you put them together correctly,
you end up with just beautiful pastry.

84
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't tell it I'm frightened of it.

85
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] I've enriched it by two eggs

86
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

87
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got baking powder in my pastry,
puffs up a bit in the oven, which I like.

88
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Get this into a bit of a ball.
You do have to be a bit light-handed.

89
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Yan] If you play with it too much,
it'll work the gluten and become tough.

90
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a fine balance.

A little glaze, a little shine, ugh.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] So, I've got a milk wash,
a normal egg wash,

308
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I'm going to use an egg yolk,

309
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it just gives it different depths
of browns.

310
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Julia] I've put it in a really hot oven,
240 degrees,

311
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
just to make sure
that everything is cooked through.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Putting one in.

320
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] I wasn't going to stagger them,
I wanted to get them all in at once.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I hate rushing, it's not me.

329
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Oh, I've just ruined John Lennon's eyes.
Looks a bit more like Noel Gallagher,

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is gonna go in

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then I'm going
to get them out right at the last minute.

334
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't want John to look a bit,
you know, anaemic.

335
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They might all be anaemic.

336
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have five minutes left
to finish your feast for four.

337
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mine are going to be actually raw.

338
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] What have you got it on?

339
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Two hundred.
-Whack up the temperature.

340
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] I've turned it up to 200
instead of 190,

341
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is what I do it at home.

342
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] Maybe I should've
compromised on the design

343
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and allowed them to cook for a bit longer.

344
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's definitely pie.

345
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] It's a raw pie.

346
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cook, you rotters.

347
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Julia] It is browning up a bit too much,
so, I'll put a bit of foil,

348
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
hopefully it will work.

349
00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could you let me know
when there's 30 seconds left?

353
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've collapsed a bit,
the designs aren't as I had described.

354
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, cool, time to take out.

355
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

356
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Right, bakers,
that is your pie pit stop.

357
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please place your pies
at the end of your benches.

358
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] One raw pie.

359
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Yan] Me too.
-Awesome, dude.

360
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-That's totally rad.

-Why, it looks...

363
00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] They're raw and messy.

Shall we just... Just don't.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hello, Sophie,
tell us all about your savoury pies.

371
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I have the four seasons

372
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the filling
is a roasted butternut squash,

373
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
spinach, and blue cheese.

374
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love this plaiting around the outside.
That is so neat.

375
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So why didn't you leave it in there
a little bit longer

376
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to get that latticework cooked
a little bit more?

377
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, no, that was intentional,
so that's got a milk wash on it.

378
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Paul] And this one?

379
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, maybe that could have done
with a bit longer. [chuckles]

380
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Gosh, that looks good.

381
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] That pastry,
it's crispy all the way through.

382
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think blind baking
was a definitely a good choice.

383
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it helped.

384
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] And that filling looks perfect.

385
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] You've got enough sauce in there
to stick it together,

386
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but not so that it sogs up the pastry.
-Yep.

387
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A little bit of saltiness
coming from the blue cheese.

388
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Blue cheese is such a great flavour,
but it hasn't killed the butternut,

389
00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it hasn't killed the spinach.
You've got a really good balance.

390
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The whole thing together
is absolutely delicious.

391
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really good.
You've got the right sauce level as well.

392
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] That is a triumph.
-Well, thank you very much.

393
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's a proper Prue pat you got there.
-Yeah, no, a Prue pat.

394
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Congratulations.

395
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-I'll just double check for them as well.

396
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Just take that with me.

397
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thank you.

398
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Nice decoration, and actually
the colours are all fairly even

399
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
except for this one. What happened?

400
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. That was the last one in the oven,
it was just a rush at the very end.

401
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the little hearts around
the edge are absolutely beautifully done.

403
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay.

404
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Steven] Item one.
-[Paul] Nice bake all the way down.

405
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Perfect.
That is very good pastry.

406
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to say it
doesn't look really pretty.

407
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, there's something
quite upsetting about eating pink mash.

408
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The colour's unfortunate.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] The expectations

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

435
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was struggling for time, so I thought
I'm gonna get at least one pie cooked

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the one we are safest with
is trying this one here, with the colour.

444

Yeah, but, and filling
as well, unfortunately.

445
00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And decoration.
And four the same.

449
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Overall actually, I quite like
the colour of the pies,

450
00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
one thing I do like is the dome.

451
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love that classic dome.

452
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a quick look at this one.

453
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it is baked.

454
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

455
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Ooh, that looks good.

456
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very flaky, looks a great filling.

457
00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

458
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That pastry is terrific,
and it's well-seasoned.

459
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think your textures between the
chorizo and the sweet potato is very good,

460
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
very buttery, flaky pastry,
and it is baked.

461
00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's a bit of a triumph.

462
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Liam] Thank you.
-Well done, Liam.

-100 per cent.

464
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Very clever, very neat.

465
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like the colour, like your designs,

466
00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
looks very, very good indeed.

467
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

468
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's cooked underneath.

469
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

471
00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A mouthful of pastry
and mince is quite gluey in the mouth,

472
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

473
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mince can often give out
a lot of moisture,

474
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and actually you've combatted
that quite nicely

475
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause it's got
a lovely colour underneath.

476
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I never done it with rough puff.

514
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have I had a Portuguese tart?
Of course, I have.

515
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know the pastry, it's like a spiral.

516
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yan, how d'you say it, babe?

517
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Pastéis de Nata.
-[Steven] Pastéis de Nata.

518
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[imitating Steven]
Pastiche de Nata.

519
00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Egg tart, love.

520
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, Paul, why have you set
Pastéis de Nata as a Technical Challenge?

521
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's one of my favourite bakes
of all time.

522
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Where do things go wrong?
-From the very beginning.

523
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've got to understand the philosophy
of how a rough puff pastry actually works.

524
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're producing a flat dough with butter
in and on and folding it and chilling it

525
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and folding it again,
which pushes the layers apart

526
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>which creates this beautiful flaky pastry.</i>

527
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Moving on to the filling,
nata meaning cream.

528
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, although, it hasn't got cream in,
the texture is very much like cream,

529
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
silky and smooth.

530
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Can we eat one?
[Paul] You certainly can.

531
00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But look at the base.

532
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have that characteristic
swirl around the bottom

533
00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but when you bite into them...

534
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Go on then.

535
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Crisp pastry on the outside,
slightly chewy in the middle.

536
00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm-hmm.

537
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's really heaven.
-Now, they are worth the calories.

538
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are worth the calories.

539
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It says "Make the rough puff pastry dough

540
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
using the chilled butter."

541
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never made rough puff,
so this will be a challenge.

542
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] I'm just rubbing
the chilled butter into the flour,

543
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then I am going to add in
drops of ice-cold water.

544
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] Everything on this
is supposed to be as cold as possible,

545
00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so just trying to keep my hands out
of the equation as much as I can.

546
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just going to get...
Try and get the right consistency...

547
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Feels a bit dry.

548
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] Just roll out the pastry
and half the frozen butter

549
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
over one turn.

550
00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, that, we are going
to add the other half

551
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and we're gonna bring it back
over like that.

552
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Forgotten how to fold pastry.

553
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, it's like you fold it,
and then you turn it,

554
00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then you do it again.
I think. [laughs]

555
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God.

556
00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Give it half a turn,
do the same thing again

557
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and that creates the layers
between the pastry and the butter

558
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it puffs up crispy and flaky.

559
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sing-songy]
I have no clue if this is right.

560
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And chill.

561
00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going to make
a start on the custard now.

562
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Heat the milk and the flour in the pan,

563
00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
infusing the cinnamon and pared lemon."

564
00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Are you enjoying making it?
[Kate] No, not really.

565
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never made rough puff before.

566
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never made
this type of custard before.

567
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know what I am doing.

568
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So other than that you have no idea
what you are doing, it's going well?

569
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Great.

570
00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's all under control.
-Okay.

571
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am going to go and see if I can, uh,

572
00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
put you on some dating websites.

573
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

574
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Seriously, she's got all the qualities
that you are looking for.

575
00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She has no idea what she is doing.

576
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am going to turn my pastry over again.

577
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, this is after the first chill,

578
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I am just gonna
roll it out a little bit.

579
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Have you ever been to Portugal?

580
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Julia] No, I've actually never been
to Portugal. Have you?

581
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite beautiful-looking people.

582
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't expect it, quite,
quite beautiful-looking people.

583
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All the people there are really beautiful,

584
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never felt so ugly in all my life.

585
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Add the sugar syrup to the milk mixture,
so pour that into there.

586
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Combine with the egg yolks.

587
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So much whisking.

588
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] With custard,
you slowly add hot milk to egg yolks,

589
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and if you don't, you'll curdle the eggs,

590
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I am just doing it
as slowly as possible.

591
00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have never made
a custard with an actual whisker

592
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I'm not gonna really start.

593
00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's looking okay. I don't know
if it's going to bake all right.

594
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Roll the pastry dough to a rectangle,
then roll in to a log... How thick a log?

595
00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think there's
any hidden messages in there.

596
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just going to go with what I know.

597
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] Right, so that way.

598
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How many do we have to make, 12?

599
00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Twelve pieces out of that.

600
00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] I think I see layers.

601
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause it kind of forms
a nice little laminated kind of wheel.

602
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] I'm very confused.

603
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] It doesn't look
a very good disc, does it?

604
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, sugar.

605
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just realised
that I rolled it the wrong way.

606
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There won't be as much rolls.

607
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're right.

608
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

609
00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've gone the wrong way.

610
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I've got the same problem.
-Oh, it's so jarring.

611
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stacey] That is so annoying.

612
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just thought it was so obvious

613
00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to roll it longways to get it wider, but,
no, it should have been the other way,

614
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the short way and thinner.

615
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bigger discs, so now
they're not gonna puff up as much.

729
00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shall we get started
then on this one then, Prue?

730
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] They are about the right colour.

731
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] So this has got a swirl,
it looks quite well baked as well.

732
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Custard is a little solider
than I'd expect.

733
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it's not as light as it could be,

734
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it is creamy,
and actually the shells are okay.

735
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

What we have there are chocolate cupcakes.

736
00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] With a swirl, sort of.

737
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The pastry case isn't too bad,

738
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but that top, you can taste
the burntness coming from it.

739
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Number three,
this is a bit irregular actually.

740
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The colouring there is not too bad.

741
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My issue is, there has been
no lamination on that.

742
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is no swirl
there either, underneath.

743
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huge amounts of issues here.

744
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's half the depth it should be.

745
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is a swirl. Where has all the rest
of the custard gone?

746
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn't look like
a Pastéis de Nata at all, does it?

747
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavour is surprisingly okay.

748
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These shells look much better.

749
00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have the
characteristic swirl underneath.

750
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That's good.

751
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are a little bit better,
but the custard is quite solid.

752
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got great hopes
for this one because it looks good.

753
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] There is a swirl,
the overall feel is good.

754
00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That custard looks to me perfect,
it's creamy, it's got the blotches on it.

755
00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are pretty good, the pastry is good,
the custard is particularly good.

756
00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Right. Last one.

757
00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This looks more like
shortcrust than flaky.

758
00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can hardly see
the swirl at all, very tough pastry.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

'cause there's meat in it.

1060

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I've whacked it up, the lot,
so I've just got to wait.

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

cover it with the fruit.

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like a surprise. [chuckles]

1132
00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] No, it's actually
in the pie, isn't it?

1133
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Stacey] Yeah.
-[Prue] It is actually in the pie, yeah.

1134
00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stacey] When I took it out of the mould

1135
00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it was falling apart,
so I filled it up really quickly

1136
00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the parchment circle
is still in there.

1137
00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so sorry.

1138
00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think if you...
If you were having this as a meal

1139
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it would work.

1140
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've made a dish which tastes good

1141
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and haven't considered
the hot water crust pastry.

1142
00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yep.

1143
00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Look how straight those sides are.

1144
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's neat, it's got a lovely colour on it.

1145
00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It looks really moist
and attractive.

1146
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It does look good.

1147
00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, overall it's a bit bland.

1148
00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The stuffing and the turkey
almost taste identical.

1149
00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Brussels sprouts
are almost immaterial.

1150
00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit of a let down on the flavour.

1151
00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:01.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, this one was done
inside the tin, is that right?

1152
00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yep.

1153
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think it looks all right,

1154
00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the little bit of crimping
looks quite nice as well.

1155
00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm dying
to see that chequerboard inside.

1156
00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1157
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] That does look good. Very nice.
-[Paul] Wow!

1158
00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite stunning,
the pastry is crispy, it's golden,

1159
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
nice rich flavour to it as well.

1160
00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All the sausage meats taste different,

1161
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the fruit works with it.
I think it is absolutely wonderful.

1162
00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

1163
00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Could have been, uh, much neater.
-[Julia] Yeah.

1164
00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where the lid meets the sides,

1165
00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they look a bit
sad sitting on the top.

1166
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, you did this in the tin?

1167
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1168
00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think the asparagus works.

1169
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all been in the oven too long

1170
00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because the chicken is dry,

1171
00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the asparagus is overcooked.

1172
00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On the other hand,
the pastry is undercooked.

1173
00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My conscience kicked in,
so I ended up doing it the traditional way

1174
00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of using outside the cake tin.

1175
00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does your conscience have steely blue eyes

1176
00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a silver-grey beard?

1177
00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughter]

1178
00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Right.

1179
00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Well, it's holding together
quite nicely.

1180
00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the colours are fantastic,
look at them.

1181
00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Considering
it's a quite lean meat, goat,

1182
00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that is succulent, it's juicy,

1183
00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with the plantain
it gives you that lovely smoothness to it

1184
00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and that tropical flavour as well.
But together, it's really nice,

1185
00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and when you get that fruit,
that salsa as well,

1186
00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's spectacular.

1187
00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's absolutely wonderful.

1188
00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your grandma is a genius.

1189
00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get in. Yes, Nan. [laughs]

1190
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's your grandma's name?
-Cynthia.

1191
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Will she come round
to my house and cook this?

1192
00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Any time.

1193
00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just wanted to make my nan proud,
'cause her food is crazy, like crazy good,

1194
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
crazy good. Hashtag Cynthia.
[laughs]

1195
00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] <i>Sadly, I haven't felt like</i>
<i>this since week one.</i>

1196
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will be so gutted, I mean,
desperately gutted if I go home.

1197
00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm very pleased with the comments,
I'm really, really pleased.

1198
00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, yeah, there's just...
Really worried that...

1199
00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not enough really.

1200
00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, we were worried about Julia and Kate,

1201
00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
coming in to the showstopper.

1202
00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are we still worried?

1203
00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I thought Kate's looked amazing,

1204
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
love potato curry,
and for me I think she saved herself.

1205
00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought Julia's was a bit untidy.

1206
00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry was a bit thick
and raw in places.

1207
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And don't forget
she actually did it in the tin.

1208
00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which again, does that fit the brief?

1209
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Stacey is in trouble.

1210
00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at the pie,
the flavours were all over the place.

1211
00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think she struggled on pastry week.

1212
00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, who is in line for Star Baker?

1213
00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Liam, Yan.

1214
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's a good pastry,
and that's a great filling.

1215
00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:49.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And Sophie, yeah.
-I think Sophie is still there, Sophie.

1216
00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The thing about Sophie
was her wonderful fruits

1217
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of the forest on the top.

1218
00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It did look good,
looked very professional,

1219
00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the crimping was great.

1220
00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Liam just astonishes me week after week.

1221
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He is... He's something
of a genius with flavour,

1222
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he's got a sort of instinct
for what goes with whatever.

1223
00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can you see Sandi over the pie?
-Oh, shut up.

1224
00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughter]

1225
00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers,

1226
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the person who is Star Baker this week

1227
00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
used the wisdom of their elders

1228
00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to create a wonderful showstopper.

1229
00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Star baker is...

1230
00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Liam.

1231
00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[applause]

1232
00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So that leaves me with the horrible job.

1233
00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um, you are all amazing,

1234
00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you are down
to the last seven, it's incredible.

1235
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Somebody has to go home,
