I've brought in my friend, Roger Crust.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He can actually talk.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, don't be ridiculous, bread can't talk.

6
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what I thought. But this guy can.

7
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Say hello to Matt.

8
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I will tolerate
your whimsy to a point,

9
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What was that about?
Why didn't you say hello?

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Janusz] Bread Week. Challenging week.

41
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul's favourite. Good luck to everyone.

[Carole] After last week's escapade,
I did lose a little bit of confidence.

43
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I've got my lucky big pants on now,
my apple catchers,

44
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so, ready for anything today.

45
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it was my flavour choices
that got me where I was last week,

46
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I just hope they like these ones.

about my bread decision.

48
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It will either pay off
or it will be catastrophic. [chuckles]

49
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Good morning, bakers.
Welcome back to the tent.

50
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, both Rebs and Abdul
are a bit under the weather this week.

51
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, er, with your permission,
we thought we'd send them both

52
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
straight through to the final.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I hope that's okay.

54
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Only joking.

55
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're just gonna miss a week
and they'll be back next week.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, for your signature challenge,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the judges would love you to make
two sharing-sized pizzas

58
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that need to be delicious.

59
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, should be the kind of pizzas
that make Paul and Prue say, <i>"Mamma Mia!"</i>

60
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or the title of any other film
starring Pierce Brosnan.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can take inspiration

I mean,
he wasn't even starring in that film.

69
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wasn't starring, but he was in it.

70
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pierce Brosnan played

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Should we watch it?
-Let's go.

72
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go and watch it. All right, bye-bye.

73
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake!

74
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

75
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've made pizza more than once,
less than ten.

76
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pizza. Seems simple, doesn't it?

77
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A bit of sourdough starter,
a bit of yeast,

78
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a little bit of beetroot juice.

79
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Two hours is not a huge amount.

80
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would spend most of that
preparing the dough.

81
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The dough's gotta be
a little bit wetter than normal.

82
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] So you get those sort of bubbles.

83
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Those tend to scorch
on the top, which I love.

84
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm very much a firm believer
of pineapple does belong on a pizza.

85
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's like controversy,
that, innit? [chuckles]

86
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Overload with too many fillings
will cause problems to the base,

87
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause it won't be able to bake properly.

88
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, good, strong flavours,
not too many of them.

89
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What we're looking for is golden brown
on the outside, punching with flavour.

90
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at this, it didn't really blend well.

91
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We need two. Ideally identical.

92
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh!

93
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just gonna start again.

94
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope I have enough sourdough starter.

95
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] James, morning.
-Good morning.

96
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Hello, James.
-Tell us all about your pizza.

97
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I went for the controversial option.
I went for having pineapple pizza.

98
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've tried to upscale it a wee bit.

99
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So, I'm using pancetta.
-[Prue] I think you're very brave, James.

100
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

337
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I'm familiar with the concept.

342
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
See, spelt flour is the way forward.
That's how you do it, Mr Hollywood.

343
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got a little grease.
But I'll say it's baked.

344
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Noel] How does one ungrease a pizza?

346
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

349
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

351
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carole] Kevin, I've put
too much cheese on.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it might be in Mr Hollywood's eyes.

354
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

355
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A bit soft underneath.
I'm gonna give it another five.

356
00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll swap them over as well.

357
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The oven must be a bit uneven.

370
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

371
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Stick some figs on and then
drizzle some balsamic glaze.

373
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

377
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Twenty more seconds. 19. 18…

378

379
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

392
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it has a great structure inside.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

411
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah.

412
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Your dough looks a bit dead.
-[Prue chuckles]

413
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chilli on the bottom
works beautifully well with the balsamic.

414
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then that little hint of fig--

415
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Some of it's too sweet.

416
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah, well done.

417
00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The base looks all right.
Got life in there. The shape is awful.

418
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This one's all over the place.
-Yeah.

419
00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Love the colours on the top, though.

420
00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice texture on the crumb on the end.

421
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

422
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You promised us an upscale version
of ham and pineapple.

423
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've done it.

424
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. [laughs]

425
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's a little bit too dry.

426
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You need more tomato.
-Fair do's. Thank you.

427
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Could've added
a bit more water to your dough.

428
00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-To allow a bit of fluffiness to it.

429
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no rise.

430
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Surprisingly bland.

431
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

432
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was that beef mince?

433
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not mince. It's, er, stewing beef.

434
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mince would've been better.

435
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-That would've given you more punch.

436
00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've chosen the wrong meat.
-The chilli is strong.

437
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm disappointed. Never mind.

438
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's lots more time.

439
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Quite a thick base, isn't it?
-[Maxy] Yeah.

440
00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit more like an American pizza.

441
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, flavour is fantastic.

442
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Paul] It's quite rich, the lamb.

443
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got a great blend of seasoning.
It's delicious.

444
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The only issue for me
is that base is too thick.

445
00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It needs to be a bit thinner.

446
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you.

447
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's great shape.
-It really looks so inviting, doesn't it?

448
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it does.

449
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Thank you, darling.

450
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is really messy pizza.
-Yes, it is. [chuckles]

451
00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think your barbecue flavours inside
with the pineapple

452
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the camembert
running all the way through,

453
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it carries such a nice flavour.

454
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Pleased with that.
-[Paul] It's ingenious.

455
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have got quite a lot
of different flavours there.

456
00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But they're still separate.

457
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd have one of them
if I was in a pizzeria.

458
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Great. [chuckles]
-[Paul] Well done.

459
00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Er, you put too much of it on because
it's spewing out all over the place.

460
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You can't really see the pizza at all.
-[Carole] Hmm.

461
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Little on this
is better than a lot.

462
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-You've layered on so much that

463
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that's what's happened to the base.

464
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It should be holding.
-[Carole] Mmm-hmm.

465
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tastes divine.

466
00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's absolutely beautiful.

467
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You only made one mistake.
Too much of a good thing.

468
00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.
-[chuckles] Thank you.

469
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Your worst nightmare.

470
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't even look at it.
I just looked at you.

471
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

472
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carole] Who doesn't want
too much topping on a pizza?

473
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Usually, it's not enough topping.

474
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was bad. It was bad. [chuckles]

475
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[groans]

476
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] I didn't get a handshake,
but I was almost there.

477
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am glowing,
probably the foundation on my skin.

478
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, I'm glowing with happiness.
Super happy.

479
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>The bakers were able</i>
<i>to practise for the first challenge.</i>

480
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But the next one is a mystery.</i>

481
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, it's time
for your technical challenge,

482
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which today has been set
by the priest of yeast, Paul Hollywood.

483
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to be fast
and accurate with this recipe.

484
00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Mmm-hmm. Amen.

485
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, as ever, this challenge
will be judged blind.

486
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have to ask these two poppets
to exit the tent.

487
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For your technical challenge,

488
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul would like you each to make
a dozen identical pain aux raisins.

489
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Your pain aux raisins must be
evenly filled with raisins

490
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a smooth crème pat.

491
00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Each pain aux raisin should have
a crispy, flaky laminated dough

492
00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and should be rolled to a perfect swirl,
which keeps its shape.

493
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One more thing, Paul has specifically said

494
00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he doesn't want tails.

495
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] You have two hours and 45 minutes.

496
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Seems ample.
-Oh, seems like plenty of time.

497
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks…
-Get set…

498
00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[in sing-song voice] Bake!

499
00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kevin exhales sharply]

500
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I have an idea of what we're making.
-Bread with raisins.

501
00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is a challenging one, I must admit.

502
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, Paul, pain aux raisins,
that's not bread.

503
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Basically, it's an enriched dough…

504
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Yeah.
-…with butter folded through it.

505
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've got to make a dough,
knock out your butter,

506
00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
place it onto two-thirds of the dough,
fold over the exposed bit, fold it up.

507
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that is basically one turn.
You have to repeat that process

508
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of folding another three times.

509
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They roll it out again a bit more.

510
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They need to pop that into a fridge,
because if they don't,

511
00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
all the butter just pours out
and it's dry as a bone.

512
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We did mention the tails.

513
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As you roll up the pain aux raisins,
you're left with a little bit at the end.

514
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If the pain aux raisins

it'll pop the end out, it's called
a little tail. We don't want that.

-[Prue] Perfect texture.

517
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. I'd forgotten how good these are.

518
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

"Make a dough,

520
00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which is very open
to interpretation. [laughs]

521
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kevin] I'm going to melt the butter,

522
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so there's a bit of warmth
to get the yeast activated.

523
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, oh, wait, no,
it says place in the freezer.

524
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[James] This is an enriched dough.

525
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's along a similar line,
like a brioche kind of bread.

526
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kevin] There probably is a technique,

528
00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but at the moment,
I'm just bunging it all together.

529
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-[Syabira] No hair.

533
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He wears spectacles, glasses.

534
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is he on the "Guess Who" board?

535
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's actually pretty much done.
I'll place it in the freezer.

536
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's for five minutes.

[Sandro] With the remaining butter,
we'll make a rectangle

540
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] What did Prue say?

553
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] So we're almost
a wrestling partnership.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

561
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like a French custard.

562
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's egg yolks and sugar and milk.
And cornflour, basically.

563
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The key to perfect crème pat,
which I struggle with, is patience.

564
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't be scared of it.
Treat it with absolute contempt.

565
00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

567
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the right consistency.

569
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought it would firm up.
Didn't see this coming.

570
00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] It needs to go
into the fridge fast.

571
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It takes a long time to cool.

572
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So they're halfway through
and it's a two-hour-45 challenge.

573
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't do the maths.

574
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. Bakers, you have
eleventy-five minutes left.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

579
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So now I need to roll it to 30 times 40.

580
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yeah.

581
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
See, kids, if you roll pastry enough,
you can have guns like that.

582
00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Like that.
-Look at that.

583
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Look at that.
-Slightly smaller than mine.

584

587
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now we're rolling up really tightly.

588
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] It'll be a big sausage.

589
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

596
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Man, the crème pat didn't quite work out.

597
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1058
00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the next layer is salmon mousse

1059
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

The egg and avocado
needs a bit more basic seasoning.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would've gone more rye
to balance with the fish.

1068
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
plum sauce and char siu pork

1069
00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and pork belly
done in a sweet chilli sauce.

1070
00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1071
00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Your marbling works.
-I'm quite proud of it.

1072
00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I actually quite like the flavour.
It's a bit one-dimensional.

1073
00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-Feels like the same all the way through.

1074
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Can I just mutilate a panda?

1075
00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, there's not many left as it is.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I wonder what this was? A bloke, innit?
-[Prue] It's a fisherman, yes.

1080
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's clever.
It's wilted a lot around here.

1081
00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not sure this is the correct choice.

1082
00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I roasted them and I overdid it.

1083
00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The fillings
are fish pie and devilled eggs

1084
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and pickled gherkins and radishes.

1085
00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I like the flavours.

1086
00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bread is slightly overbaked.

1087
00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's dry.
-[Kevin] Yeah.

1088
00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And it shouldn't be dry.
-Yeah.

1089
00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit messy,

1090
00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's amusing
and it tastes really good.

1091
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1092
00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must say, it's certainly colourful.

1093
00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's a little messy on the top.

1094
00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] I've got white loaf

1095
00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I've got
a seeded wholemeal loaf as well.

1096
00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fillings are salmon and avocado,

1097
00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
egg and cress, and prawn and crayfish.

1098
00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your three fillings are delicious,
well-seasoned and balanced,

1099
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they actually
all go together quite nicely.

1100
00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The seeded one is a bit too heavy.

1101
00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The white is lovely.

1102
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But I congratulate you
for trying to do two breads anyway.

1103
00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1104
00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It looks absolutely astonishing.

1105
00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's beautifully constructed.

1106
00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's really original. Wonderful.
-[Paul] Hmm.

1107
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] The bottom layer
is eggs with cucumber,

1108
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the middle layer
is the roasted marinated chicken,

1109
00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the top layer
is the sambal anchovy cream with peanuts.

1110
00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Mmm.
The chicken in particular is delicious.

1111
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Isn't it? Really.
-It's really good.

1112
00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The lightness of the cucumber
adds to that, balances everything out.

1113
00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Terrific design.

1114
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really good flavours. Unusual.

1115
00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's lovely.
-Thank you.

1116
00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] That was amazing.
-[Paul] Hmm.

1117
00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've got a little bit of a lean.
-[Sandro] Lean, yeah.

1118
00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not surprised,
with the amount of meat inside.

1119
00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This thing is ridiculous.

1120
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got the shredded beef,
a sirloin steak,

1121
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I've got sloppy joes in there.

1122
00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The bread is baked beautifully.
Soft, light.

1123
00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The frosting balances well with the inside

1124
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause inside, you've got that tang
coming from the barbecue.

1125
00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can't identify any of the food

1126
00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the barbecue sauce
overwhelms everything.

1127
00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't see
a lot of difference between them all,

1128
00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it really is delicious.

1129
00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Well made. Thank you.

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[judges] Well done.

1131
00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dawn, I think it really looks lovely.

1132
00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a very simple design.

1133
00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's hope it tastes as nice as it looks.
-Oh.

1134
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Ooh, look at that.
-[Prue] Ah.

1135
00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the bread's good,

1136
00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but some of the bread slices
are just too thick.

1137
00:52:58.760 --> 00:52:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yep.

1138
00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're missing dried mince,
sesame seed, coriander.

1139
00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:08.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All these key flavours
that in Greece is well known.

1140
00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dawn] Mmm.

1141
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's about identifying the flavours.
It's too bready as well.

1142
00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dawn] Bread Week
has been an embarrassment.

1143
00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think
I'm at the bottom of the pile this week.

1144
00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm quite concerned.

1145
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] I'm really pleased with myself
because I took a big risk.

1146
00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks like fish and chips.

1147
00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They loved it, which I'm very happy.

1148
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kevin] The one redeeming feature
was the little cucumber man.

1149
00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm pinning my hopes on him.

1150
00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] So, eight bakers.

1151
00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did that make the competition
a little tougher?

1152
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Honestly, I think this showstopper

1153
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
has been one of the most difficult
I've judged ever.

1154
00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There were some exceptional things
in that showstopper.

1155
00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Janusz has done exceptionally well.

1156
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But I think
Syabira's was even better.

1157
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Malaysian flavours, they were fantastic.

1158
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sandro should be up there as well.

1159
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
His pizza was excellent,

1160
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
fourth in technical,
and the bread was exceptional.

1161
00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] This morning,
I was pretty sure Carole would be leaving

1162
00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because she did so badly yesterday,
and I think she's saved herself.

1163
00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For me, she's still in that bottom three,

1164
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
along with Dawn.

1165
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That was pretty bland.

1166
00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kevin struggled as well.
It looked a bit of a mess.

1167
00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] You've got to look at
Kevin, Dawn, and Carole.

1168
00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Because they were all so equal,

1169
00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we have to look
at all their scores carefully.

1170
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hello, bakers.
I've got the brilliant job this week

1171
00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of announcing the Star Baker.

1172
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the person
who is Star Baker this week is…

1173
00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Janusz.

1174
00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[cheering]

1175
00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughter]

1176
00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1177
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I have the horrible job
of announcing who's going home.

1178
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the person going home this week is…

1179
00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, this week, nobody's going home.

1180
00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[applause]

1181
00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The judges felt, given the quality here,

1182
00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the fact
that Rebs and Abdul aren't here,

1183
00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that everybody
deserved the chance to bake again.

1184
00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[applause]

1185
00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you so much.

1186
00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] Feeling that you are a Star Baker
is a feeling out of this world.

1187
00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You just cannot believe that someone says,
"No, you're the one this week."

1188
00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Janusz is very artistic,
almost illusion in some of his bakes.

1189
00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's clever,
and certainly one to watch going forward.

1190
00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, I dodged a bullet. [laughs]

1191
00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So relieved.
That was, like, squeaky-bum time.

1192
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carole] For the next few days,
I just wanna sleep.

1193
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But no, it's practise every day.

1194
00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got me online shopping coming tomorrow,

1195
00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going to be on the ball.

1196
00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] They're all thrilled
because nobody had to go.

1197
00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're all friends, they don't
want to see their friends going.

1198
00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But sooner or later,
we have to send two bakers home,

1199
00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that's not nice.

1200
00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[indistinct chatter and laughter]
