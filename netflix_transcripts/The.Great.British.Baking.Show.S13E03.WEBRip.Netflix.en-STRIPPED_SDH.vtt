<c.bg_transparent>It's quite sweet because there's onion.</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>but if you get a bit towards the edge,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>it's absolute perfection.</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>One thing I do like</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>and I've made it into a cream</c.bg_transparent>

448
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

<c.bg_transparent>It should be</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>I like the fact that you've got</c.bg_transparent>

459
00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>but they are slightly misshaped,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>but that's fine.</c.bg_transparent>

460
00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Let's have a look, shall we?</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>Take a slice out of this.</c.bg_transparent>

461
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>So this is</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>an Italian flavour-inspired bread.</c.bg_transparent>

462
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>So we have porcini mushroom and garlic,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>and then red pesto and green pesto knots.</c.bg_transparent>

463
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

464
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

465
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>I think the pesto one's a bit weak.</c.bg_transparent>

466

<c.bg_transparent>I think proving is a little bit shy</c.bg_transparent>

476

<c.bg_transparent>There's an olive and rosemary one,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>and then an 'nduja and basil.</c.bg_transparent>

477
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Not getting the rosemary with the olive.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>I'd like to see more olive.</c.bg_transparent>

478

<c.bg_transparent>Even then, I would have always</c.bg_transparent>

480

<c.bg_transparent>It's just that if I didn't know</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>there were olives in there,</c.bg_transparent>

481
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

<c.bg_transparent>But if you sat down with some friends</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>and that.</c.bg_transparent>

483
00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-Glass of wine. Perfect.</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>At first glance, I would have perhaps</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>It looks good, it's baked well,</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>You've done the lace nicely,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>but it's got a few joins.</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>I added orange zest, rum, vanilla extract,</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>fresh raspberries inside.</c.bg_transparent>

1343
00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>That won't come off your fingers,</c.bg_transparent>

1345
00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

<c.bg_transparent>You'd almost think it was a cake.</c.bg_transparent>

1347
01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>It's very cake-like, but it's light.</c.bg_transparent>

1348

1352
01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<c.bg_transparent>The coconut and sugar is glittery,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>so it shimmers.</c.bg_transparent>

1353
01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>I think the roses have worked out well.</c.bg_transparent>

1354
01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>The pipe work's</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>a little bit all over the place.</c.bg_transparent>

1355
01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Inside, I fill with coconut paste</c.bg_transparent>

1356
01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Really nice and powerful coconut flavour.</c.bg_transparent>

1357
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>And I like the cherries.</c.bg_transparent>

1358
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Glacé cherries wouldn't be one</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>I would choose normally,</c.bg_transparent>

1359
01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-but actually, the glacé cherries…</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-I think it's lovely.</c.bg_transparent>

1360
01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-…work really nice with this.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-Okay.</c.bg_transparent>

1361
01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>And I think the bread is baked</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>quite nicely as well. I quite like that.</c.bg_transparent>

1362
01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-I think you've managed to achieve…</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-Oh, thank you.</c.bg_transparent>

1363
01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>…something that has surprised me,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>which is quite unusual.</c.bg_transparent>

1364
01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

<c.bg_transparent>-Oh, thank you.</c.bg_transparent>

1365

<c.bg_transparent>It doesn't make you want to eat it.</c.bg_transparent>

1366

<c.bg_transparent>No, it doesn't.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>There's certainly a Halloween feel to it.</c.bg_transparent>

1367
01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-Samhain.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-Yeah. Yeah.</c.bg_transparent>

1368

<c.bg_transparent>So it is a sort of winter,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>autumny-spiced, erm, sweet bread</c.bg_transparent>

1369
01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1370
01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>It's underbaked, sadly.</c.bg_transparent>

1371
01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-Is it?</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-It's certainly underproved.</c.bg_transparent>

1372
01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>It's really claggy.</c.bg_transparent>

1373
01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>You cannot put apple in a bread like this</c.bg_transparent>

1374
01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>because apple will leak moisture</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>into a dough as it's trying to prove,</c.bg_transparent>

1375
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>which will make it quite gloopy as well.</c.bg_transparent>

1376
01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

<c.bg_transparent>You know,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>I think it looks absolutely astonishing.</c.bg_transparent>

1379

<c.bg_transparent>I love the couronne</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>because it's exposing what's inside.</c.bg_transparent>

1381
01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>And that's how it should look.</c.bg_transparent>

1382
01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>But let's have a look and see, shall we?</c.bg_transparent>

1383
01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:59.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>The bread is a couronne with pistachio,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>marzipan, cherries, apricots,</c.bg_transparent>

1384
01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>and there is a light rose icing</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>on there as well.</c.bg_transparent>

1385
01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Yes, Aaron.</c.bg_transparent>

1386
01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>That's beautiful.</c.bg_transparent>

1387
01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>The pistachio, marzipan, the fruit level.</c.bg_transparent>

1388
01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>It's really tasty.</c.bg_transparent>

1389
01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>I think you've done</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>a decent job with that,</c.bg_transparent>

1390
01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>and the flavours you've chosen</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>have worked really well on this.</c.bg_transparent>

1391
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>I think that's pretty faultless.</c.bg_transparent>

1392
01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>What a great tribute.</c.bg_transparent>

1393

<c.bg_transparent>-Thank you, thank you.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-Well done.</c.bg_transparent>

1394
01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Yeah! </c.bg_transparent>

1395
01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Well done.</c.bg_transparent>

1396
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>I told you I could bake bread. </c.bg_transparent>

1397

<c.bg_transparent>Thank you.</c.bg_transparent>

1398
01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>I would have to say</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>I think that was probably</c.bg_transparent>

1399
01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>one of the most beautiful things</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>I've ever actually made.</c.bg_transparent>

1400
01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Happy that I did well today.</c.bg_transparent>

1401
01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>But, equally… my Signature was so poor.</c.bg_transparent>

1402
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

<c.bg_transparent>They didn't like flavour,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>they didn't like the bake,</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>That was a wild ride, wasn't it?</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>What a Showstopper.</c.bg_transparent>

1412

1418
01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Going into the Showstopper, it was Pui Man</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>and Nataliia who were in trouble.</c.bg_transparent>

1419
01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>I thought Nataliia's Showstopper</c.bg_transparent>

1422
01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>I thought,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>"This is the comeback kid again".</c.bg_transparent>

1423
01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>She always saves herself</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>in the Showstopper.</c.bg_transparent>

1424
01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Yeah, but in the Technical,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>she's either been down at the bottom</c.bg_transparent>

1425
01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

<c.bg_transparent>So who's in line for Star Baker?</c.bg_transparent>

1428
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1431
01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>That was a great Showstopper.</c.bg_transparent>

1432
01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>And Nadia, Signature she did well,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>second in the Technical,</c.bg_transparent>

1433
01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>and I thought</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>her Showstopper was fantastic.</c.bg_transparent>

1434
01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
