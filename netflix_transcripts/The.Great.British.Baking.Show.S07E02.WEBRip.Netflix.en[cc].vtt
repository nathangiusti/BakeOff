00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Definitely taste like Bakewell.
First thing you get is almond.

366
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

375
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

could've done with
a bit more baking.

379
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Feels like a paste.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

385
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The mousse is right round the--

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Henry] The mousse

387
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needed a bit longer
to set, that mousse.

388
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the flavours are beautiful.

390
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really, you've pulled it off,

391
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-it's just that that mousse hasn't set.
-Yeah.

392
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
They look a bit messy on the side.

393
00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The nougat kind of sloughed out of it.
It didn't work as well...

394

395
00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like when you've got
a sloughy wound,

396
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-all the pus coming out of it.
-Just like that.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I like the blend
of the nougat with the bitter chocolate,

400
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you do get that coconut as well.

401
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It just looks a bit messy.
-Yeah.

402
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But well slacked and sloughed.
-[chuckles]

403
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I mean, they look quite chunky,
don't they? But they look neat.

404
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Hmm.

405
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The textures are good
except for the marshmallow.

406
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The marshmallow's not quite right.

-Yeah.

408
00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I love the lemony middle.

409
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that's genius.

410
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The lemon and the rosemary
come through beautifully.

411
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Marshmallow adds
a little bit of sweetness,

412
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the dark chocolate
that little bit of bitterness.

413
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you have the perfect blend
of all the flavours.

You all right, darling?
Do you want a chair?

417
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispers] Yay. Well done.

418
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah. [chuckles]

419
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] They look fairly neat.
Pretty uniform.

420
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the idea of this coffee biscuit.

421
00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no.

422
00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very crumbly.

423
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've put semolina in there.

424
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

425
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the crumbliness.

426
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm less keen on the coffee flavour,
I think it's a bit too strong.

427
00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

428
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
They do look a bit messy.

429
00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

430
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perhaps they taste better than they look.

431
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul chuckles]
Watch your fingers, Prue.

432
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Remind me what the top is?
-[Phil] It's a fudge.

433
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's certainly a sugar rush.

434
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a pleasant flavour.

435
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right at the end, you get the cranberries,
so you get that little kick of bitterness.

436
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You need that because it is sweet.
-Mm-hmm.

437
00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just don't think
it looks particularly good.

438
00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Take what you can get, Phil.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

439
00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll take that.

440
00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I don't actually want to bite
the end off this finger.

441
00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

442
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm working here, people.

443
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm fearing Paul's reaction here.

444
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit boring.

445
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The biscuit's got that feeling
of being slightly stale.

446
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's almost got that flavour, to me,
of being slightly stale too.

447
00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe you don't like
the flavour of matcha?

448
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I understand. It's like Marmite.

449
00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But they're very original.
-Thank you.

450
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] They look absolutely identical.

451
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're nicely made.

452
00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Let's have a look inside,
shall we?

453
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. Very nice hokey-cokey flavour.

454
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's delicious 'cause you've got
so many textures,

455
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
including the honeycomb.

457
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] I wanted something more,

463
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
even if you'd spun white chocolate on it
or done some effect.

464
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

didn't you?

465
00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

466
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

467
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chocolate's got a nice kick to it,
but it's too thick.

468
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

any flavours 'cause what's happening is,

469
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the chocolate's overtaken everything.

-I put the caramel in too hot.

473
00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like biscuits after an earthquake.

Jamie, that's an awful lot of caramel.

476
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

485
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not too sweet.

486
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the lime and the mint is perfect.

These are a favourite of my dad's,
but remember to be accurate and neat.

513
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

514
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't know if anyone
knows Paul's dad at all?

515

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As ever, the Technical
will be judged blind,

517
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so we're gonna ask these two pretties
to leave the tent. Off you pop.

518
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bye.
-Okay.

519
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Where are they going?

520
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue's crimping Paul's hair
for the judging.

521
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] He likes to look nice.

522
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Ah, it's worth the effort.

523
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For your Technical Challenge,
Paul would like you to make 12 fig rolls.

524
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-"Controversial," I hear you thinking.
-[Sandi] Mm.

525
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are they biscuits or are they cakes?

526
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I can feel a court case coming on.
-[bakers laugh]

527
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your fig rolls must use
a soft biscuit dough

528
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and be filled

529
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Mm-hmm.

530
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-There's something else.
-Identical in shape and size.

531
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They need to be identical in shape and...
-[all laugh]

532
00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a given at this point.
-Who knew? Who knew?

533
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have just 90 minutes.

534
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks...
-Get set...

535
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake.

536
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Phew.

537
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>The bakers have</i>
<i>only an hour and a half</i>

538
00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>and Paul's pared-down recipe.</i>

539
00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God.

540
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] <i>...to create 12 perfect fig rolls.</i>

541
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never even eaten a fig roll.

542
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] <i>It's about getting it</i>

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, obviously,
if it's Paul's dad's favourite,

544
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then they've gotta taste amazing.

545
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jamie] <i>I got the worst comments</i>

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wanna try and redeem myself a bit.

547
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What could go wrong?

548
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, Mr Hollywood, fig rolls,

549
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that's a bit of
a simple challenge, isn't it?

550
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not as easy as they probably think.

551
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>There's several areas</i>
<i>where they could fall down.</i>

552
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One is the biscuit dough
on the outside.

553
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which is quite cakey, isn't it?

554
00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It is. Very soft, very crumbly.

555
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's too crumbly,
the whole thing will fall to pieces.

556
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Two, it's about the accuracy
of how you cut it,

557
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so they all look exactly the same.

558
00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then three,
the temptation is to overbake these

559
00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and try and put a strong colour on.

560
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Nice pale biscuit colour,

561
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-isn't it?
-It is.

562
00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The figs are beautifully balanced
with the cinnamon.

563
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hint of ginger, that stem ginger
right at the back. They're delicious.

564
00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I remember growing up with my dad
eating these,

565
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
watching the wrestling

566
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How many could he eat?

567
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He'd probably go through a packet.

568
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, roll on fig rolls.

569
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

570
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Phil] Here we go.

571
00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It just says, "Using the creaming method,
make the biscuit dough."

572
00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michael] Very simple instructions.

573

"Make the biscuit dough."
This guy sells recipe books, mate.

[Steph] We've got unsalted butter,
muscovado sugar,

575
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and some icing sugar for dusting.

576
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm a bit confused.
I did the dough with the icing sugar.

577
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The muscovado might be
for the figs, but I'm not sure.

578
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

580
00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] They're figs.
They look delicious.

581
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have one.

582
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They don't look like monkey testicles
in any way. [laughs]

583
00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Blitz into a paste with the spices."

585
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How much? It doesn't say that.

586
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul said "lightly spiced",
so I'm not gonna put loads in.

587
00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michael] I think
a tiny bit of spices at a time,

588
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause like Paul said last week,

589
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"You can always add,
but you can't take away."

590
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm putting in a healthy amount, I think.
-Ooh.

591
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going minimal.
He said, "lightly." Light, light.

592
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What I don't want them to say is that
they can't taste any of the spices.

593
00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't taste anything but sweetness.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

You've got 45 minutes left.

604
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

605
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm rolling it like a Swiss roll,
'cause I make Swiss rolls all the time.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cut them in half. Quick. Go.

618
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cut them in half. Oh! That was close.

619
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Half an hour of fig roll fun left, people.

to decorate with visible lines
and to slightly flatten them."

622
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just gonna do a light imprint there.

623
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hm. They're not, like, 100% identical,
but they're not bad.

624
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Helena] Oh, my God.
Looks perfect. You should see mine.

625
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got biscuit in your hair.

626
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Oh.

627
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

628
00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It makes it look like I've tried.

629
00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Phil] Just gotta bake 'em now.

630
00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The question is
how long do you bake 'em for?

631
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll just give Paul's dad a ring.
Do you know his number?

632
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think
they're gonna take very long.

633
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amelia] I might give 'em 20 minutes.
I'm going for golden brown.

634
00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

635
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jamie] I'm egg-washing 'em.

636
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn't say to, but you've gotta
give 'em an extra edge.

637
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

639
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't feel like they're a car crash,
so that's good.

640
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I looked at them,
but I don't know what I was looking for.

641
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-Is that a thing?

643
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yeah. [laughs]

645
00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna take 'em out.

649
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Only one person's got theirs out yet,
so I'm okay.

650
00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no, I am. No, I'm not.

655
00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh. I thought I didn't have
the right number then.

656
00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

657
00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

658
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How did I do that?

659
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm in trouble.

660

662
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never dusted things with such care.

663
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm trying to put similar ones together.

664
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I definitely did 11. I'm a moron.

669
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-[Paul] It's broken up. It's overbaked.

693
00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. Pastry's quite tough, too.
That's because it's been overworked.

694
00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-[Paul] It is a nice shape.
-[Prue] And they're quite nice and full.

696
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

some are flat and some are thin.

700
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's how they've rolled it up.

701
00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hm. And they're not
absolutely the same shape

702
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. It's the flavours.

703
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm not getting any cinnamon or ginger.
-Feels dry.

704
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, these aren't flattened at all.

705
00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] No, they're not flattened.
-[Prue] But they are very beautiful.

706
00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Plenty of filling in it,

707
00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I think that is very delicious.

708
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got just a hint of cinnamon
and ginger.

709
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Now, there's an issue here
with the dough itself.

710
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry's very soft
and it's flattened out.

-This one, actually, has only got 11.
-[Prue] You're absolutely right.

712
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The least of the problems.

713
00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue laughs] That is not a fig roll.

714
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't believe they've egg-washed it.
It's like a sausage roll.

715
00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is like a sausage roll.
But they're very neat.

716
00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's quite tough, that pastry, isn't it?
-It is a bit.

717
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-These are a little bit flat and uneven.
-[Paul] See how rough it is?

718

1032
00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michelle] This is fire
for my dragon's mouth.

1033
00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] I think there's another dragon
in here.

1034

1035
00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1036
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just haven't got the time to speak.

1037
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Yours looks good though.

1038
00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've only done wings.

1039
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's all I've managed
to get out at the minute.

1040
00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1041
00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michael] Stuck them on the wrong sides.

1042
00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks really messy.

1045
00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just don't feel confident
that I can do it now. [sighs]

1046
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Priya] Don't. If you get upset,
I'll cry, honestly.

1047
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't bear it. I can't.

1049
00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Priya] Okay, 'cause I'll start crying
if you start crying. I mean it.

1050

1051
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1052
00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have just half an hour.
You can do this.

1053
00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1054
00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't hear you say "I can't".
I said you can. You can.

1055
00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, what's next?

1056
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Phil] Just about to make the legs,
head and tail from brandy snap.

1057
00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] This is for the tail of my cat.

1058
00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite dark, that.
[exhales deeply]

1059
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gonna start the decoration.

1060
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] This is coconut
and white chocolate buttercream.

1061
00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Helena] I'm painting dark chocolate

1062
00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so then I can sprinkle toasted coconut
and make it look like hairs.

1063
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michelle] This is really important.

1064
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is what makes it look scaly,
my dragon.

1065
00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Phil] Make it stand out in the dark.

1066
00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't want to tread on it,
do you?

1067
00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think
things need to be bright-coloured.

1068
00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Classy is sometimes nicer.

1069
00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gold star for me.

1070
00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1071
00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1073

Everyone's is looking really good.

1074
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm making a spider web with spun sugar.

1075
00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh, God.

1076
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles] I'm just trying
to make some black icing

1077
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I can pipe some hair.

1078
00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1079
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bakers, you have one minute left.
-One minute.

1080
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry] I'm gonna pipe some music notes.

1081
00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amelia] I look like an old lady.
This is hilarious.

1082
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1083
00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Phil] Running out of time rather quickly.

1084
00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jamie] That's never gonna
stay on in a million years,

1085
00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
unless I propped it up with that.

1086
00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just the eggs.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] That is the end of your time.

1089
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please step away from your Showstoppers.

1090

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1093
00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Noel] David, would you like
to bring up your Showstopper?

1098
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] Want a hand?
-No, I'm okay.

1099
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1100
00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] It looks beautiful, the work
you've done with the shortbread,

1101
00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you've done an amazing job.

1102
00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:42.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the decoration is so skilful.
It's beautifully done.

1103
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Delicious.

1106
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The fennel really works
with the citrus together.

1107
00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The tuiles are delicious.

1108
00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They snap.

1109
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've thought that through.

1110
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that's excellent, David.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Well done.

1112
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I think it looks great. It is ingenious.

1113
00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oof. There's some chilli in there,
isn't there?

1114
00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In fact, there's a lot of chilli in there.

1115
00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1116
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I quite like it. It's underbaked,
it's gone really soft.

1117
00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the heat coming through is great.

1118
00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I'm a little disappointed, Henry.

1119
00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had this vision of being able to see
all the pipes soaring up to the heavens.

1120
00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Where's the keyboard?

1121
00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're certainly crisp,
but they're a bit too thick.

1125
00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they're a bit too thick,
them, for sure.

1128
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Yeah.
-You could've done better.

[Paul] It's a cat version of
a gingerbread house. It's very clever.

1130
00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Sandi] Ah.

1131
00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's nice and thin.

1132
00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Snaps beautifully.
Good kick of ginger at the end,

1133
00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but I think it's slightly overbaked.
-Okay.

1134
00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I think it's so clever
the way you've curved the legs slightly

1135
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in the way that tortoises
get along. [laughs]

1136
00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] I love you doing
a tortoise impersonation.

1137
00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's, er... That's made my day,
that has.

1138
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I'd have liked to have seen
more colour on those Florentines.

1139
00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They need to be in the oven much longer.
It's way underdone.

1140
00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Mm, yeah.
-[Paul] It's a shame.

1141
00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I was expecting a bit more
definition on the dolphin.

1142

Amelia, I'm a little disappointed
that you used stacking.

1144
00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We did say we wanted you
to use dough as if it was clay.

1145
00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got a nice snap to it.

1146
00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think they're baked well,
although it could carry more flavour.

1147
00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's okay.
It doesn't blow my mind.

1148

1149
00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispers] Never mind.

1150
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] That's highly impressive, Rosie.

1151
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1152
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

which taste great.

1154

[Prue] That's such a delicate biscuit.
It's really good.

1155
00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The gingerbread is very, very soft,

1156
00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-which is a shame.
-Okay.

1157
00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It needed a little bit longer
in the oven.

1158
00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1159
00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1160
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The whole composition is a triumph.

1161
00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

-[chuckles]

1163
00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I think it's astonishing.

1164
00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's really elegantly done,
and the piping is exquisite.

1165
00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's a work of art.

1166
00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's beautiful.
The colours look lovely.

1167
00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The langues de chat,
they're disappointing.

1168
00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are really tough,

1169
00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
whereas langues de chat
should be very delicate.

1170
00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The look of it is good,

1171
00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but how many times have we said
style and substance?

1172
00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got to have both.

1173
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I must say the dragon looks
a little clumsy.

1174
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I ran out of time.
-[Prue] Yeah.

1175
00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Remind me of the ingredients.

1176
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pistachio, cardamom,
lemon zest and coconut.

1177
00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that's one of the most
interesting biscuits I've ever tasted.

1178
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] Oh, wow.
-[Prue] It really is delicious.

1179
00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is packed with flavour,
and the texture's beautiful inside.

1180
00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you've done Wales proud.

1181
00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, thank you. Mmm. [laughs]

1182
00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-[Paul] Looks great.
-Thank you. [chuckles]

1183
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a very big sheep
in a very small field.

1184
00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing] It's very sweet.

1185
00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think the macarons
have done a fantastic job.

1186
00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Lovely.
-They do taste great.

1187
00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The white chocolate and the coconut
really come through.

1188
00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That shortbread is really citrusy
and sharp and lovely.

1189
00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it does break down beautifully
in the mouth, and it's well baked.

1190
00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I love the whole sculpture,
because it's funny.

1191
00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that's a fine piece of work.

1192
00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you so much.
-[Prue] Really good.

1193
00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] Well, it's unmistakably a guitar.

1194
00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite simple.

1195
00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all a little thick and clumsy.

1196
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And there's too much icing on there.

1197
00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your piping is, erm, not the best.

1198
00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Beautiful biscuit.
-Oh, thank you.

1199
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Delicate, light, lovely lemon flavour
coming through.

1200
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1201
00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Decoration's not bad.
I quite like the colour.

1202
00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's just a little bit clumsy.
-[Jamie] Yeah.

1203
00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] I think you could've done better.
-Yeah.

1204
00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I think that is the most sculptural piece.

1205
00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Artistically it's superb.
The spider looks very impressive.

1206
00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The Earl Grey is interesting,
the leaves in the shortbread.

1207
00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd never have thought of that,
but it actually works.

1208
00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I have to eat
a bit of the spider too now.

1209
00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That works beautifully as well.
It's nice and bitter.

1210
00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Your friend. Are you happy now?

1213
00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] It was crawling
towards you anyway.

1214
00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

an amazing job.

1215
00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've obviously got
a massive artistic flair. It's magical.

-[Sandi] It was fantastic.

1230
00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Powerful.

1231
00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Rosie's doing well, actually.
I think, overall,

1232
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
there's some people that really excelled.
David did well.

1233
00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I thought his Showstopper was amazing.
-It was amazing.

1234
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Those flowers.
-[Prue] It was exquisite.

1235
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] And Alice.
-[Prue] Alice's sheep

1236
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
made me laugh so much. It was such
a sweet sheep, but really well baked.

1237
00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So they're in line for Star Baker.

1238
00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought Helena
coming into this challenge

1239
00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
was in a little bit of trouble,

1240
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but that spider, unbelievable.

1241
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But that is what can happen
in the Showstopper, isn't it?

1242
00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It just bumps them straight up.
-[Paul] Yeah.

1243
00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] It feels as though
Amelia's in some trouble.

1244
00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think Amelia struggled.
Biscuits are not her thing.

1245
00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And Jamie. He was eleventh in Technical
and bad in the Signature.

1246
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] His Showstopper tasted delicious
but quite clumsy-looking.

1247
00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think either one of those could go.

1248
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or two.

1249
00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Or two.
-Or two.

1250
00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could we go?

1251
00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Absolutely.
-Okay.

1252
00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Well done, bakers.
That is week two in the bag.

1253
00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Many congratulations. Now, I do not think
it is going to be a surprise to anybody

1254
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when I announce who is the Star Baker.

1255
00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is somebody who pretty much nailed
in first place every single one

1256
00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of the three challenges.
This week's Star Baker is Alice.

1257
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[cheering and applause]

1258
00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That leaves me with the horrible job
of announcing who's leaving us.

1259
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the person who's leaving us
this week is...

1260
00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jamie. [tsks] Sorry, mate.

1261
00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all right.

1262
00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-[Michelle] Aw.

1263
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's sort of mixed emotions.
Obviously, I'm a bit gutted,

1264
00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I'm also, like, proud of myself
for what I've done.

1265
00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't get in the tent
unless you're a good baker. Don't stop.

1266
00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just a great experience,
that's why I just don't want it to end.

1267
00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I'm just mainly gonna miss everyone, so...</i>

1268
00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a bittersweet moment.

1269
00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm absolutely devastated for Jamie.
Obviously, I'm relieved that it's not me.

1270
00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Through to next week.
That's a relief, definitely.

1271
00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I'm just really determined</i>
<i>to prove it to myself</i>

1272
00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that I'm good enough to be here.

1273
00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amelia] Alice. Well done, mate.
You deserved it.

1274
00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You did really, really well.

1275
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't believe it.
I can't believe I'm Star Baker.

1276
00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you so much.
-[Prue] You deserved it.

1277
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] Thank you.

1278
00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so happy. Just over the moon.

1279
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Hi, Ede, it's me.</i>

1280
00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[woman on phone] <i>Hello, darling.</i>
-[man on phone] <i>How'd you do? How'd it go?</i>

1281
00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got Star Baker.

1282
00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[woman on phone] <i>Oh, wow! Wow! Wow!</i>

1283
00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice laughs] <i>You're on speakerphone,</i>
