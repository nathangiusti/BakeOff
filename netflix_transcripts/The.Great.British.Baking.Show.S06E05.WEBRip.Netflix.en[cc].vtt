-So how many bakers are left?
-Er, nine.

2
00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:16.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we had nine last week?

3
00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:17.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. Well, we would have had
nine last week

4
00:00:17.965 --> 00:00:19.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
except one of the bakers was sick,

5
00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:20.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but he's now returned,
so we're back up to nine.

6
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:23.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we send someone home every week,
so that would take us down to seven,

7
00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:25.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and with a baker coming back,
that would be eight.

8
00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:27.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, except Paul and Prue
went rogue last week

9
00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:29.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and they didn't send anybody home.

10
00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:30.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, will there be eight, next week?

11
00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:32.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, no. 'Cause we're sending
two people home, er, this week

12
00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:34.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and two from nine is seven.

I'm just excited about spice week.

32
00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:34.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Terry] Last week I was not well at all,

33
00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:36.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so, to come back today,
it's a lovely feeling

34
00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:40.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and whatever happens,
at least I'll stay or go on merit

35
00:01:40.845 --> 00:01:42.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
rather than on something
out of the ordinary.

36
00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:44.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] Two people go this week,

37
00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:45.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is on everyone's mind.

38
00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, the odds are high.

39
00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:51.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I were a cat I was maybe down,
to maybe, four lives, maybe less.

00:01:52.285 --> 00:01:53.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just don't know. Maybe three

41
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:55.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

these three challenges go. [chuckles]

44
00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:01.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul and Prue would love you
to make a ginger cake.

45
00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:03.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Your ginger cake
can be made

46
00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:04.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
using any form of ginger that you choose.

47
00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fresh, dried, stem, syrup.

48
00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:08.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can use complimentary flavours--

49
00:02:08.885 --> 00:02:11.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But ginger must be the dominant flavour.

50
00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:12.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You knew that?
-I did know that.

51
00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:16.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yep. Your ginger cake needs to be
a suitable size for a family teatime.

52
00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:17.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't know that.

53
00:02:17.685 --> 00:02:19.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have two hours
to make your ginger cake.

-Get set...

55
00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:22.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

56
00:02:24.285 --> 00:02:27.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ginger is my favourite spice
and we're looking for a ginger cake.

57
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:32.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's about finding that balance of heat,
spice, flavour, warmth.

58
00:02:32.645 --> 00:02:34.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean if you want a sort of fudgy,

59
00:02:34.845 --> 00:02:38.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
sticky kind of cake,
then stem ginger would be good.

60
00:02:38.565 --> 00:02:41.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a mistake to think that the answer
is to use fresh ginger.

61
00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:44.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

62
00:02:44.485 --> 00:02:45.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>it loses its flavour.</i>

63
00:02:45.925 --> 00:02:48.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ginger does compliment well
with a lime or a lemon,

64
00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:49.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but you've gotta find those levels

65
00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:53.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
where ginger is still that gorgeous
flavour that comes pouring through.

00:15:20.605 --> 00:15:24.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:24.525 --> 00:15:26.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:48.445 --> 00:16:50.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Quite annoying really. [chuckles]

385

00:16:52.205 --> 00:16:53.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:53.765 --> 00:16:54.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

388
00:16:59.445 --> 00:17:01.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] It looks quite impressive.
It's a lovely looking cake.

389
00:17:01.485 --> 00:17:02.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

391
00:17:07.525 --> 00:17:09.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It didn't taste very gingery
or very sweet.

392
00:17:09.165 --> 00:17:11.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

393
00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:14.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To be honest, apricot and the ginger
together doesn't necessarily work.

394
00:17:14.965 --> 00:17:15.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

395
00:17:19.045 --> 00:17:20.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

396
00:17:20.245 --> 00:17:22.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it is down to
the temperature of the cake.

397
00:17:24.285 --> 00:17:25.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:29.565 --> 00:17:31.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the ginger's not overwhelming either.

400
00:17:31.525 --> 00:17:34.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's definitely a winter one
with loads of custard for sure.

401
00:17:34.365 --> 00:17:35.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

402
00:17:35.765 --> 00:17:36.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

404
00:17:43.325 --> 00:17:45.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The attention to detail looks fantastic.

405
00:17:49.965 --> 00:17:52.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is the most beautiful textured cake.

406
00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:54.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:54.965 --> 00:17:56.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
from the ginger in the powder
is beautifully balanced

408
00:17:57.125 --> 00:17:58.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

that comes through.

That is, erm...

410
00:18:00.685 --> 00:18:01.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's, erm...

411
00:18:02.325 --> 00:18:03.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] ...beautiful.

412
00:18:04.325 --> 00:18:06.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ah. Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done, Kim.

413
00:18:06.125 --> 00:18:07.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[bakers clapping]

414
00:18:07.845 --> 00:18:09.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kim-Joy] Got such sweaty hands.
[chuckles]

415
00:18:09.765 --> 00:18:12.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you so much. Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done Kim-Joy. Wonderful.

416
00:18:18.525 --> 00:18:20.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, there's
an issue to the lean.

417
00:18:20.565 --> 00:18:22.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] Yep.
[Prue] Leaning tower of ginger.

418
00:18:22.605 --> 00:18:24.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] But I think it comes down to timing

419
00:18:24.085 --> 00:18:26.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the sponge is probably
still too warm.

420
00:18:29.005 --> 00:18:30.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gone more and more condensed.

421
00:18:30.725 --> 00:18:32.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So as you start at the top it's lighter,

422
00:18:32.885 --> 00:18:34.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
slightly less so, slightly more dense...

423
00:18:34.765 --> 00:18:36.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And very.
[Paul] ...and then dense.

424
00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:39.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's such a pity because being too warm
when you were putting it together

425
00:18:39.205 --> 00:18:40.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
has affected everything.

426
00:18:44.085 --> 00:18:46.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Very elegant looking cake.
[Prue] Very elegant.

427
00:18:46.445 --> 00:18:47.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And a little touch of chocolate.

428
00:18:48.005 --> 00:18:50.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Again, you blowtorched it.
-[Prue] Nicely done.

429
00:18:51.645 --> 00:18:53.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh, it got a bit all together.

430
00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:54.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Such a rich colour in there.

431
00:18:54.965 --> 00:18:56.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm...

432
00:18:57.845 --> 00:18:59.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Certainly, get the ginger and the lemon.

433
00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:02.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's so beautiful how soft the sponge is.

434
00:19:02.285 --> 00:19:04.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And because the lemon curd is so strong,

435
00:19:04.525 --> 00:19:06.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-the Italian meringue makes it less so.
-Mmm-hmm.

436
00:19:06.965 --> 00:19:08.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it's one of the best ginger cakes
I've had for some time.

437
00:19:09.045 --> 00:19:11.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[gasps] Yay! [chuckling]
-[all clapping]

438
00:19:12.685 --> 00:19:13.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. Can I have one Prue, too?

439
00:19:13.845 --> 00:19:15.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That actually reminds me of my nan's cake,

440
00:19:15.845 --> 00:19:18.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is full of ginger,
but it's the bake. It's so good.

441
00:19:18.725 --> 00:19:20.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you so much. Thank you.

442
00:19:20.205 --> 00:19:21.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great job, Manon.

443
00:19:23.365 --> 00:19:25.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So happy. Got a handshake.

444
00:19:25.885 --> 00:19:28.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And a Prue pat as well.

445
00:19:28.085 --> 00:19:29.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispers] Kim-Joy.

446
00:19:30.445 --> 00:19:32.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got a handshake.

447
00:19:33.045 --> 00:19:35.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In my head I was like,
"This is really cool.

448
00:19:35.485 --> 00:19:37.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hope they think it's cool."
And they thought it was cool.

449
00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:39.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you happy?
-Yeah, yeah. I'm trying.

450
00:19:39.725 --> 00:19:41.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're just "trying"? [chuckles]

451
00:19:41.365 --> 00:19:43.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll probably give the recipe to my mum

452
00:19:43.365 --> 00:19:45.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so that she can make it.

453
00:19:45.325 --> 00:19:47.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not sure
whether they will like it or not.

454
00:19:47.965 --> 00:19:50.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't want it to look like
you don't know what you're doing.

455
00:19:51.525 --> 00:19:52.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Sandi] <i>Spice week's technical challenge </i>

458
00:20:01.445 --> 00:20:05.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>is twice as mysterious as</i>

459
00:20:05.085 --> 00:20:06.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've got this.

460
00:20:06.845 --> 00:20:10.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, your technical challenge today
has been set for you by Paul.

461
00:20:10.725 --> 00:20:12.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, any words of advice or wisdom?

462
00:20:12.925 --> 00:20:15.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This challenge is
all about delicate baking.

463
00:20:15.645 --> 00:20:16.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That can't be it.

464
00:20:18.445 --> 00:20:19.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's it.
-[Sandi] Okay.

465
00:20:19.765 --> 00:20:21.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As ever it's judged blind

466
00:20:21.285 --> 00:20:23.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'm gonna ask you two lovelies
to leave the tent.

467
00:20:24.285 --> 00:20:25.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're gonna go and play <i>Fortnite. </i>

468
00:20:25.885 --> 00:20:27.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-It's an online survival game.

469
00:20:28.005 --> 00:20:29.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not going well.
Prue keeps killing Paul.

470
00:20:29.685 --> 00:20:30.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, okay.

471
00:20:30.965 --> 00:20:34.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyway, for your technical challenge,
Paul would like you to make

472
00:20:34.085 --> 00:20:36.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
two batches of six maamoul.

473
00:20:36.925 --> 00:20:38.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Come again?

474
00:20:38.285 --> 00:20:41.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maamoul, you know, the delicious
ancient pastries from the Middle East.

475
00:20:41.525 --> 00:20:46.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One batch must be filled with
walnuts and shaped with a mould.

476
00:20:46.445 --> 00:20:49.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The other batch must be filled
with a date paste

477
00:20:49.685 --> 00:20:52.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and must be decorated
by pinching the dough

478
00:20:53.005 --> 00:20:54.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with maamoul tongs.

479
00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:56.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] There you go.

480
00:20:56.325 --> 00:20:58.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Never before have I known less
about what I'm saying right now.

481
00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:00.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laugh]

482
00:21:01.725 --> 00:21:03.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got an hour-and-a-half.
On your marks...

483
00:21:03.445 --> 00:21:04.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get set...
-Bake.

484
00:21:05.285 --> 00:21:06.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Karen] Maamoul. Maamoul.

485
00:21:06.525 --> 00:21:08.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maamoul. Maamoul.

486
00:21:08.525 --> 00:21:10.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know what a maamoul is.

487
00:21:10.445 --> 00:21:11.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] <i>No idea what they look like.</i>

488
00:21:11.845 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>No idea what they taste like.</i>

489
00:21:13.645 --> 00:21:16.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So whatever I make,
I'll be happy with. I hope.

490
00:21:17.645 --> 00:21:19.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, I'm really ashamed to say

491
00:21:19.525 --> 00:21:23.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that I have never heard of maamoul.
What are they?

492
00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:25.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Traditionally,
it's Middle Eastern pastry

493
00:21:25.525 --> 00:21:28.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
eaten at the end of Ramadan
and it's really celebratory.

494
00:21:28.525 --> 00:21:29.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you have two different types here.

495
00:21:29.765 --> 00:21:31.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have the date. You have the walnut.

496
00:21:31.925 --> 00:21:32.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] They're so beautiful.

497
00:21:33.045 --> 00:21:36.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, we've got some pretty punchy flavours
going on inside these.

498
00:21:36.565 --> 00:21:38.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have mastic, basically a resin

499
00:21:39.045 --> 00:21:40.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it smells a little bit like aniseed.

500
00:21:40.885 --> 00:21:43.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now this is mahlab. This is a seed

501
00:21:43.885 --> 00:21:47.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that sits inside the cherry kernel,
but as soon as you grind them down,

502
00:21:47.645 --> 00:21:50.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
this becomes a very potent flavour.

503
00:21:50.165 --> 00:21:52.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite like almonds
and cherries at once.

504
00:21:52.245 --> 00:21:55.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Yes. These two spices
are in the pastry itself.

505
00:21:55.925 --> 00:21:56.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It sounds wonderful.

506
00:21:57.045 --> 00:21:58.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The tricky part is, actually,

507
00:21:58.685 --> 00:22:01.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you want definition on the pastry.

508
00:22:01.125 --> 00:22:02.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, over handle it,

509
00:22:02.365 --> 00:22:04.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it becomes too rubbery,
becomes too oily and you're gonna lose it.

510
00:22:04.405 --> 00:22:06.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If we start with the walnut...

511
00:22:07.245 --> 00:22:09.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's really lovely.
-It's very, very delicate.

512
00:22:09.565 --> 00:22:11.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the orange blossom
and the cardamom.

513
00:22:12.005 --> 00:22:14.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But in the date one,

they've gotta be careful of...

00:22:20.485 --> 00:22:22.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:22:22.365 --> 00:22:25.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We are for the dough,
but not for the filling.

[Briony] So we've got, for the dough,

00:22:33.685 --> 00:22:35.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kim-Joy] I've never cooked

525
00:22:38.725 --> 00:22:42.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's an ingredient in tsoureki,

Add the ghee and rub together

528

00:22:55.885 --> 00:22:56.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then knead until smooth.

531
00:22:57.525 --> 00:22:59.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

532
00:22:59.645 --> 00:23:00.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] What does it look like?

533
00:23:00.965 --> 00:23:02.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

535
00:23:03.565 --> 00:23:06.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll tell you, at no point
did Noel and I know what we were saying.

536
00:23:06.325 --> 00:23:07.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-There's no point.
-So you don't know either? No. Okay.

537
00:23:08.005 --> 00:23:09.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I've absolutely...

538
00:23:09.645 --> 00:23:10.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Jolly good.

539
00:23:10.885 --> 00:23:12.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the recipe says knead
until smooth. I've kneaded.

540
00:23:12.845 --> 00:23:13.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's pretty smooth.

541
00:23:15.205 --> 00:23:17.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm now gonna make the date filling.

542
00:23:17.285 --> 00:23:20.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rosewater. Ground cinnamon. Mahlab.
There's no, like, quantities.

543
00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:23.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:23.125 --> 00:23:24.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:24.725 --> 00:23:27.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Ruby] How much do I add in?

546
00:23:27.085 --> 00:23:28.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll start little and then add.

547
00:23:28.645 --> 00:23:30.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't want to overload it.

548
00:23:31.885 --> 00:23:34.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm putting one quarter of a teaspoon.

549
00:23:34.125 --> 00:23:35.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It doesn't say how much rosewater.

550
00:23:35.965 --> 00:23:37.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very fragrant.

551
00:23:40.325 --> 00:23:42.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sniffs] It doesn't smell unpleasant.

553
00:23:44.285 --> 00:23:47.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's to do with the softness.
It's not fire cracking.

554
00:23:47.245 --> 00:23:50.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got a lot of rose in it.
I'm gonna put some more spices in there.

557
00:23:56.525 --> 00:24:02.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Walnuts. Golden raisins. Orange blossom.
Honey. And some ground cardamom.

558
00:24:02.485 --> 00:24:05.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a funny flavour, cardamom.
It can overpower things.

559
00:24:05.445 --> 00:24:08.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It'll be fine. I'm tasting it
as I'm making the filling.

560
00:24:09.445 --> 00:24:11.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

You're back to make maamoul.

00:24:12.045 --> 00:24:14.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yeah, just what I was dreaming of.

562
00:24:14.165 --> 00:24:15.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] I know what I want,

563
00:24:15.805 --> 00:24:18.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:26:25.765 --> 00:26:26.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

620
00:26:28.685 --> 00:26:30.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, I'm just going to put it in.

than pastry, really,

00:26:34.605 --> 00:26:36.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:29.645 --> 00:27:31.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

My fault entirely.

00:28:02.605 --> 00:28:06.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:43.165 --> 00:28:44.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a look at the date.

672
00:28:44.765 --> 00:28:47.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:49.685 --> 00:28:52.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Doesn't taste of dates.
That spice, it's too strong.

674
00:28:52.565 --> 00:28:54.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

overboard there with the flavours.

00:28:55.085 --> 00:28:56.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

676
00:28:57.085 --> 00:28:58.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:58.725 --> 00:29:00.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:03.605 --> 00:29:05.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:16.245 --> 00:29:18.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:19.685 --> 00:29:20.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

689
00:29:24.045 --> 00:29:25.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] There's no pattern on this.

690
00:29:25.565 --> 00:29:27.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:31.685 --> 00:29:33.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:35.125 --> 00:29:37.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

That's quite well baked.

695
00:29:40.205 --> 00:29:42.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you get that floral hint
coming from the rosewater?

696
00:29:42.565 --> 00:29:43.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:44.645 --> 00:29:46.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:46.605 --> 00:29:48.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

They got the wrong shape.

00:29:54.765 --> 00:29:58.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:58.605 --> 00:30:01.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, a little bit of
definition here. Neat.

704

00:30:03.285 --> 00:30:05.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

706
00:30:08.325 --> 00:30:09.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:12.725 --> 00:30:14.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] And even then, again,
fairly uniform.

710
00:30:14.485 --> 00:30:17.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the real shape on the top.

I don't think you should milk a maid.

Oh, no. It's just looking rubbish now.

00:44:45.725 --> 00:44:47.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jon] I don't know what the hell
has gone wrong with these.

The biscuits are breaking
as I'm pushing them down.

00:44:53.405 --> 00:44:55.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

The ganache has let me down.
Just wouldn't hold.

1041
00:45:06.885 --> 00:45:08.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, not getting sandwiched.

1042
00:45:08.605 --> 00:45:10.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's nothing else I can do about it.

1043
00:45:10.285 --> 00:45:12.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1044
00:45:12.285 --> 00:45:13.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah!

1045
00:45:16.125 --> 00:45:18.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just going to be really tight with time.

1046
00:45:22.205 --> 00:45:23.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:45:26.165 --> 00:45:27.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[stutters] Yeah, yeah.

1049
00:45:29.045 --> 00:45:31.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Eight maids milking. We're down to seven.
One's dropped on the floor.

[Rahul] This looks so messy.

1053
00:45:39.885 --> 00:45:40.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Oh, that doesn't.

1055

-[inhales deeply]

1058
00:45:55.565 --> 00:45:59.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please step away from
your biscuit chandeliers.

1060
00:46:01.405 --> 00:46:03.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're our biscuit chandeliers
in this room,

1061
00:46:03.125 --> 00:46:04.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I didn't even think there'd be one.
-[Briony] Yeah, they are.

1062
00:46:04.525 --> 00:46:05.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] You're so annoying.

1063
00:46:06.365 --> 00:46:07.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What did I do now?
Come on, Ruby.

1064
00:46:07.725 --> 00:46:10.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're so annoyingly good.
-You can't say that to me.

1065
00:46:13.285 --> 00:46:17.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>It's judgment time</i>
<i>for the spiced biscuit chandeliers.</i>

1066
00:46:17.205 --> 00:46:19.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Manon, please will you
bring up your showstopper.

1067
00:46:20.365 --> 00:46:22.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, this is a delicate business.

1068
00:46:22.765 --> 00:46:23.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] What could go wrong?

1069
00:46:29.325 --> 00:46:31.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] I think it looks amazing.
-Thank you.

1070
00:46:32.005 --> 00:46:34.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the detailing
round the top is very good,

1071
00:46:34.165 --> 00:46:36.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but what's impressive is the fact that
you've given it all the same shade

1072
00:46:36.965 --> 00:46:38.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
all the way down.

1073
00:46:38.365 --> 00:46:40.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now the chequerboard effect...

1074
00:46:40.485 --> 00:46:42.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you build it all up
and then chop it--

1075
00:46:42.405 --> 00:46:43.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes... Ooh.

1076
00:46:43.685 --> 00:46:45.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laugh]

1077
00:46:45.365 --> 00:46:46.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then--

1078
00:46:48.165 --> 00:46:49.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Oh. Wow, we're under attack.

1079
00:46:57.285 --> 00:46:58.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all about the spice for me,

1080
00:46:58.685 --> 00:47:01.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I'm not getting much in the way of
massive amounts of flavour,

1081
00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:02.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which I would have expected.

1082
00:47:02.885 --> 00:47:05.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But as the biscuit goes and the design,

1083
00:47:05.645 --> 00:47:06.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's very, very impressive.

1084
00:47:13.845 --> 00:47:16.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The pattern
on the butterflies is exquisite.

1085
00:47:16.605 --> 00:47:18.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But what does it taste like?

1086
00:47:24.685 --> 00:47:26.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't get any cinnamon in that biscuit.

1087
00:47:26.165 --> 00:47:27.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All the flavour comes from the icing,

1088
00:47:27.925 --> 00:47:30.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is almost a synthetic flavour
that I'm getting.

1089
00:47:34.565 --> 00:47:36.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Ruby] They were meant to be sandwiched,
but unfortunately with the heat,

1090
00:47:36.845 --> 00:47:39.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as you suggested, it wouldn't stay.

1091
00:47:42.325 --> 00:47:44.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pistachio's lost,
but the cardamom in there is delicious

1092
00:47:44.325 --> 00:47:45.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it's a beautifully baked biscuit.

1093
00:47:45.725 --> 00:47:46.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1094
00:47:46.965 --> 00:47:49.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Rahul, please bring up
your chandelier.

1095
00:47:49.325 --> 00:47:50.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Don't drop that, please.

1096
00:47:57.645 --> 00:48:00.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think what you've done is, is beautiful.

1097
00:48:00.605 --> 00:48:01.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the colours are amazing.

1098
00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:04.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got the sugar work inside there
as well, which is fantastic.

1099
00:48:04.765 --> 00:48:06.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1100
00:48:06.325 --> 00:48:09.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's almost like time was
against you all the way.

1101
00:48:09.165 --> 00:48:10.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How many biscuits did you make?
A hundred and fifty?

1102
00:48:17.725 --> 00:48:20.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavour of that cardamom,
the way it melts in the mouth,

1103
00:48:20.405 --> 00:48:22.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the butter in the biscuit is beautiful.

1104
00:48:22.245 --> 00:48:23.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've even got
that little bit of blossom,

1105
00:48:23.605 --> 00:48:25.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that little hint at the back as well.

1106
00:48:25.405 --> 00:48:26.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a fantastic biscuit.

1107
00:48:26.765 --> 00:48:28.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You need to pull something back

1108
00:48:28.565 --> 00:48:30.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause it's nearly there.

1109
00:48:30.165 --> 00:48:32.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just a little bit messy in places.

1110
00:48:37.725 --> 00:48:39.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The biscuits look solid, you know, chunky.

1111
00:48:39.765 --> 00:48:41.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We're big girls in Pontefract.
-[all laugh]

1112
00:48:42.725 --> 00:48:44.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still are. Sorry.

1113
00:48:50.125 --> 00:48:53.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's weird is the liquorice
and cardamom together tastes like ginger.

1114
00:48:53.205 --> 00:48:57.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Liquorice is one of those flavours that
has to be quite pure to come through.

1115
00:49:06.005 --> 00:49:07.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm curious about the texture
of this biscuit.

1116
00:49:07.925 --> 00:49:09.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's almost got a skin on the top of it.

1117
00:49:09.525 --> 00:49:10.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] Yeah, it's kinda cracked, yeah.

1118
00:49:10.845 --> 00:49:11.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. I've never seen anything like it.

1119
00:49:12.005 --> 00:49:13.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, okay. Well I hope you like it.

1120
00:49:19.125 --> 00:49:21.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mixed spice, a little bit of clove,

1121
00:49:22.525 --> 00:49:23.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
turmeric...

1122
00:49:24.485 --> 00:49:26.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales] Possibly.

1123
00:49:27.605 --> 00:49:29.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is unusual. I've never had
a biscuit like that before.

1124
00:49:29.805 --> 00:49:30.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1125
00:49:33.285 --> 00:49:36.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kim-Joy, would you like to
bring up your spiced biscuit chandelier.

1126
00:49:43.405 --> 00:49:45.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, that is exquisite.

1127
00:49:45.325 --> 00:49:48.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Aww.
-Your piping is phenomenal.

1128
00:49:48.165 --> 00:49:49.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, these little biscuits
down the bottom.

1129
00:49:49.725 --> 00:49:51.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, look at the detail on that.

1130
00:49:51.805 --> 00:49:52.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's absolutely gorgeous.

1131
00:49:53.005 --> 00:49:55.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the little icicles
with the isomalt as well.

1132
00:49:55.365 --> 00:49:56.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very, very clever.

1133
00:49:56.765 --> 00:49:57.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1134
00:50:04.085 --> 00:50:06.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The spices you've got in there
really work together.

00:50:06.565 --> 00:50:08.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's the classic Christmas combination.

1136
00:50:08.285 --> 00:50:09.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have you got a little bit of
nutmeg in there as well?

1137
00:50:09.805 --> 00:50:10.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, oh, yeah, nutmeg.

1138
00:50:11.005 --> 00:50:14.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got a lovely warmth to it.
That is very, very well thought through.

1139
00:50:14.805 --> 00:50:16.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you so much.

1140
00:50:22.805 --> 00:50:23.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was stunning.

1141
00:50:32.405 --> 00:50:34.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you finish it?

1142
00:50:34.205 --> 00:50:35.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did you get everything done?
-No. No.

1143

[Paul] The biscuits, look quite dark,
some of them.

1144
00:50:37.245 --> 00:50:39.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This tree at the bottom looks a bit...

1145
00:50:40.085 --> 00:50:41.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Black.
-Yeah.

1146
00:50:41.205 --> 00:50:42.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Run by the flavours again for me?

1147
00:50:42.805 --> 00:50:46.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Er, cinnamon, mixed all spice
and black pepper.

1148

1149
00:50:50.605 --> 00:50:52.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's quite bland.
-Really?

1150
00:50:52.725 --> 00:50:55.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Considering what you put in there,
all the spices and the pepper,

1151
00:50:55.885 --> 00:50:58.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I expected it to be full of flavour
and it just isn't.

1152
00:50:58.085 --> 00:50:59.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

1153
00:50:59.325 --> 00:51:00.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The maids here are
a slightly different biscuit.

1154
00:51:05.245 --> 00:51:06.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not getting it again.
-No?

1155
00:51:06.805 --> 00:51:10.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the idea was very good
and you got a lot of the detail on there,

1156
00:51:10.285 --> 00:51:11.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I think you took on far too much.

1157
00:51:12.045 --> 00:51:13.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1158
00:51:13.405 --> 00:51:16.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jon, would you like to bring up
your biscuit chandelier please.

1159
00:51:27.565 --> 00:51:29.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a bit messy.
-It is very.

1160
00:51:29.285 --> 00:51:31.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It feels like it needs finishing off.

1161
00:51:40.605 --> 00:51:43.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As far as the flavour goes,
cinnamon is the king there.

1162
00:51:43.685 --> 00:51:45.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, it is like a shortbread,

1163
00:51:45.445 --> 00:51:46.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
such a delicate, buttery biscuit.

1164
00:51:47.045 --> 00:51:50.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I was blindfolded and ate that,
it would have been fantastic.

1165
00:51:50.885 --> 00:51:52.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

1166
00:51:52.325 --> 00:51:53.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Cheers.
-[Sandi] Thanks, Jon.

1167
00:51:59.805 --> 00:52:02.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, my lovely bakers,
nothing left for you to do

1168
00:52:02.605 --> 00:52:04.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
while Paul has to decide
who is the star baker

1169
00:52:04.805 --> 00:52:09.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and who are the two people
who are going to be leaving us this week.

1170
00:52:10.045 --> 00:52:13.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Briony] <i>That's like, nine down to seven.</i>
<i>It's just such a big jump, you know. </i>

1171
00:52:13.365 --> 00:52:16.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd like to think that I did well,
but yeah, I don't know.

1172
00:52:16.565 --> 00:52:19.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul's very diplomatic,
a gentleman, I think.

1173
00:52:19.725 --> 00:52:21.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Very kind actually. </i>

1174
00:52:21.325 --> 00:52:23.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jon]<i> I can bake better than that. </i>

1175
00:52:23.525 --> 00:52:26.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hopefully with the flavours
in my biscuits,

1176
00:52:26.885 --> 00:52:28.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it'll keep me through to week six

1177
00:52:28.445 --> 00:52:30.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause that's all I'm hoping for
at the moment.

1178
00:52:30.445 --> 00:52:32.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Karen] <i>Clearly, I'm one of them. </i>

1179
00:52:32.525 --> 00:52:34.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am going home.

1180
00:52:34.965 --> 00:52:36.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course.

1181
00:52:36.525 --> 00:52:38.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[quacking]

1182
00:52:43.125 --> 00:52:45.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've lost your double act partner.
How was it for you?

1183
00:52:45.405 --> 00:52:46.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I missed Prue, actually, today.

1184
00:52:47.005 --> 00:52:49.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I missed her. There's too
much testosterone at this table.

1185
00:52:49.405 --> 00:52:51.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What, from you and Paul?
-Yeah.

1186
00:52:51.245 --> 00:52:52.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul and Sandi chuckle]

1187
00:52:52.845 --> 00:52:56.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the showstopper, has that
shifted things dramatically?

1188
00:52:56.085 --> 00:52:57.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think when it comes to star baker...

1189
00:52:57.925 --> 00:53:00.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think, Rahul is in the running.
Again, his biscuit...

1190
00:53:01.285 --> 00:53:02.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unbelievable...
I mean, it melted in the mouth.

1191
00:53:03.325 --> 00:53:05.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to put Kim-Joy
in the mix for star baker

1192
00:53:05.725 --> 00:53:08.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because that showstopper was superb.

1193
00:53:08.925 --> 00:53:11.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Karen and Terry were struggling
a little bit coming into the showstopper.

1194
00:53:11.765 --> 00:53:12.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still struggling?

1195
00:53:13.005 --> 00:53:14.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] There was no real
spice coming through.

1196
00:53:14.965 --> 00:53:16.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Briony did quite well.
[Paul] Yeah.

1197
00:53:16.485 --> 00:53:18.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Has she saved herself?
[Paul] It was a strange one.

1198
00:53:18.245 --> 00:53:20.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She used a lot of
different spices, didn't she?

1199
00:53:20.845 --> 00:53:22.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She did and I think,
probably if I'm honest, too many.

1200
00:53:23.125 --> 00:53:25.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will put Jon in there as well.

1201
00:53:25.125 --> 00:53:27.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was a bit all over the place
and sort of a bit messy.

1202
00:53:27.965 --> 00:53:29.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As Prue's not here,
did you want our help

1203
00:53:29.725 --> 00:53:32.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause we... We can absolutely
help you make your decision?

1204
00:53:33.645 --> 00:53:35.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-[Sandi] Okay.

1205
00:53:35.445 --> 00:53:37.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's a no. I think that's a no.
Is that a no?

1206
00:53:51.205 --> 00:53:54.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, well done, bakers. That's the end
of the very first ever spice week

1207
00:53:54.285 --> 00:53:56.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and what a fragrant success
you made of it.

1208
00:53:56.805 --> 00:53:58.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This week I have the great job
of announcing

1209
00:53:58.885 --> 00:54:01.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
star baker and it was quite tight.

1210
00:54:01.885 --> 00:54:05.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the star baker this week is

1211
00:54:06.405 --> 00:54:08.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Kim-Joy.

00:54:10.525 --> 00:54:12.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's so good. Well done.
So proud of you.

1213
00:54:14.285 --> 00:54:17.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I get the rotten job I'm afraid.

1214
00:54:17.565 --> 00:54:20.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a really unusual week,
we are sending home two people.

1215
00:54:21.325 --> 00:54:23.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the two people
who will be leaving the tent...

1216
00:54:33.885 --> 00:54:35.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are Karen and Terry.

1217
00:54:37.405 --> 00:54:38.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, well. That's all right. No problem.

1218

-[Ruby] Sorry, love.
-That's all right.

[Sandi] It was great.
You got halfway through.

I've had here. [exhales]

1222
00:54:49.045 --> 00:54:50.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

00:54:53.045 --> 00:54:54.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...as a personal achievement,

1225
00:54:55.005 --> 00:54:57.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
nothing will ever top this,
I don't think, obviously.

00:55:06.205 --> 00:55:08.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:55:29.285 --> 00:55:32.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

that void for a long time.

00:55:32.725 --> 00:55:34.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
