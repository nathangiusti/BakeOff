[Janusz] Gonna pipe meringue
to look like latte foam.

200
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But, yeah, my hands are literally shaking.

201
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you been drinking?
-[laughing] No, not for a long time now.

202
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna begin poaching. So I'm gonna
poach my meringues in the milk.

203
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] Let's try the first one.

204
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna poach them
for two minutes on each side.

205
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone will be poaching
their meringues in liquid.

206
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mine rely on steam
because you will destroy the piping.

207
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My meringues have gone wrong.
They're too soft and totally collapsed.

208
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's like the Titanic, little icebergs.
-In what way?

209
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Little mini icebergs.
-I thought you meant the tragic ending.

210
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

211
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you touch them on the outside,
and they look fluffy, it's almost ready.

212
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At least, that's what I think.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] That looks good. It's done.

215
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Matt] What you looking at?

216
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm looking at that magic over there.

217
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

219
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yours look like that.

220
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing] Yeah.

221
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kevin] These are not good. A bit rough.

222
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] Put them in the minty sand.

223
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both] Bakers, you have 15 minutes.

224
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] Putting the custard in.
Prosecco jellies have set.

225
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] It's a minty sand
topped with the crème anglaise.

226
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kevin] Nice bit of
retro kitsch glassware.

227
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] This coffee smells good.
There we are, baby.

228
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna jazz this up now.

229
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Abdul] This is my cherry coulis.
-Right. Meringues next.

230
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] They're very delicate things.

231
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] Float the island.

232
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] Float, baby, float.

233
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, they do float.

234
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kevin] Oh, that's a sorry-looking one.

235
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Syabira] How long do I have left?
-Bakers, you have one minute left.

236
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Abdul] Oh, boy.
-[Syabira] Time pressure.

237
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] Just final decorations.

238
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So this is a raspberry and lychee coulis.

239
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Maxy] Blueberry sauce.
-[Sandro] Add the hazelnuts.

240
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kevin] Oh, coral tuile is ready.

241
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] Caramel decorations.

242
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] Think I'm just rushing a bit.

243
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is looking a mess.

244
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See.

245
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] My hands are literally shaking.
Too much coffee.

246
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

247
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] Oh, my God!

248
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up.

249
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please step away
from your floating islands.

250
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, that's cool.
They look like coated, breaded chicken.

251
00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Maxy] Yeah.
-[Abdul laughing] Coated, breaded chicken?

252
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the last thing
I want to hear, Sandro.

253
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira chuckles]

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

256
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Hi, Syabira.
-[Prue] Hello.

257
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I actually thought
it was a deep-fried chicken.

258
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sitting in béchamel sauce.
-That's delicious as well.

259
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

260
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it is a floating desert island.

261
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's covered in sand.

262
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It does look great.

263
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is a lime crème anglaise

264
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
topped with the meringue,
coated with the minty sand.

265
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As always,
there's nothing wrong with your flavours.

266
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're fresh, they're very distinct.

267
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And your meringue is beautifully poached.

268
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's a great mojito.

269
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The custard is perfect.

270
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The lime's got a sharpness
that cuts through. So it's not too sweet.

271
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very clever.
-Well done, Syabira.

272
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're in some kind of crazy groove.

273
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

274
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look nice. Quite attractive.

275
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The meringue's lost its height
because of the weight of the caramel.

276
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have orange custard.

277
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Look at that custard.

278
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then we have a cherry coulis.

279
00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is absolutely delicious.

280
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very sweet, but the custard's
an excellent flavour. I love the orange.

281
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-I'd like to see the meringue more robust.

282
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks quite appetising.
I'm not sure it's enough for a dessert.

283
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Combination of flavours
is really delicious.

284
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The acidity of the purée

285
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
sets off the meringue's
sweetness perfectly. It's lovely.

286
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The blueberry's
got a lovely tartness to it.

287
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the crème anglaise
could have been a little bit thicker.

288
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's quite effective.
-Looks like a latte.

289
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your crème anglaise texture
is absolutely perfect. It's thick enough.

290
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As a latte goes, it's delicious.
Just enough coffee in there.

291
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very delicate,
and I love the flavour and texture.

292
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's delicious.

293
00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm really tempted to keep going,
but I won't 'cause I've got more to come.

294
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Thanks.

295
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] I think it looks busy.
-[Prue] I do think they look quite pretty.

296
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have the cherry jelly,
bit of Prosecco,

297
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
spiced custard with brandy…

298
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Certainly got brandy in it.

299
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Certainly has.

300
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very alcoholic.

301
00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the custard is perfect
from a texture point of view.

302
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would've been better
not to have Prosecco in the jelly…

303
00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

304
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
…because the brandy is quite enough.

305
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You got carried away.

306
00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thank you.

307
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The puree, it's probably
slightly watered it down.

308
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Slackened off the crème anglaise.
-[Kevin] Mmm-hmm.

309
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The custard is smooth as anything.

310
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the Prosecco.

311
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a lovely, light mouthful,

312
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it does mean that the islands
are a bit squashed.

313
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Meringues have disintegrated
with the Prosecco.

314
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the alcohol
has broken the meringue apart.

315
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The lychee is delicious.
-[Prue] Mmm.

316
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

317
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kevin] That was another mixed one.

318
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bottom of a pretty good bunch
is an okay place to be. [laughs]

319
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul said it looks like
a chicken on béchamel.

320
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But they said the custard was perfect.
I'm very pleased.

321
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Too much going on.
It was too busy, which it was.

322
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Game plan going into the technical
is I'm sitting at the back.

323
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I got the whole view to see
what everyone else is doing. [laughs]

324
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>The Bakers were able</i>
<i>to practise their floating islands,</i>

325
00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>but have no idea what awaits them</i>
<i>in the technical challenge.</i>

326
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, bakers, it's time
for your technical challenge

327
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which today has been set
by Prue-be-doo-be-doo.

328
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prue-be-doo, any words of advice?

329
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take your time and keep your cool.

330
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That cannot be it.

331
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That is it.
-[Noel laughing]

332
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As ever, this technical challenge
will be judged blind.

333
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we're gonna have to ask
these two to hop it.

334
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[angrily] Go on, get out of it.
Don't want you around here.

335
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[normally] For your technical challenge,
we're gonna do something different.

336
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're gonna have a staggered start time
and a staggered finish time.

337
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What? [giggles]
-[Sandro] What?

338
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everybody leave the tent
except for Sandro.

339
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughter]
-What?

340
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Janusz] Bye-bye!
-No, but wait.

341
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] What is going on?

342
00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

343
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No pressure.

344
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The judges would like you to make

345
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
six pistachio and praline ice cream cones.

346
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your cones should be dipped
in chocolate and nuts.

347
00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then topped
with a pistachio and praline ice cream.

348
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have two hours and 45 minutes.

349
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On your marks…

350
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get set…
-Bake.

351
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] This is
the most nervous I've felt.

352
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Normally, the other bakers are here.
So I get to see if I'm on the right track.

353
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But today, all alone.

354
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pistachio and praline
ice cream cone for a technical,

355
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
this is a first.

356
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's Custard Week,
and to make good ice cream,

357
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you have to make good custard.

358
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd like there to be at least
one and a half scoops in there.

359
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I always feel cheated when I get a cone
and there's just a little mound on top.

360
00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They have to make their own cones.

361
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They should be golden brown, not pale.

362
00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if they are too dark,
they'll be too brittle.

363
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And you get that nasty--
-Slightly burnt taste.

364
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] One of the tricky things
about this challenge is the timing.

365
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they don't get their ice cream
frozen properly,

366
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we are going to have pistachio soup.

367
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we're doing staggered starts to
make it absolutely fair when we judge it.

368
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Should we try them?

369
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, that is beautiful.

370
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cone is crispy,
silky-smooth ice cream.

371
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The texture from
the praline inside is lovely.

372
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's really good,
strong pistachio flavour.

373
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even on a cold day,

374
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
having ice cream,
actually, doesn't really matter.

375
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Tastes great.
-I know.

376
00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] Never even heard
of a custard ice cream.

377
00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs to be frozen,
so gotta be pretty quick.

378
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To begin with,
it says to make crème anglaise.

379
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is a mixture
of double cream and milk.

380
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna wait until it starts to simmer,
which is already, it's getting there.

381
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Come join the party, baker two.
-[Noel] Join us.

382
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The judges would like you to make
six pistachio and praline ice cream cones.

383
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have two hours 45 minutes.

384
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On your marks…

385
00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get set…
-Bake.

386
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] It is very empty and very quiet.

387
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think more or less
I know what I'm doing.

388
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm ready for you, ice cream.

389
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These eggs will be creamed
with some sugar.

390
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then mix that in…

391
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Baker three, would you join us?

392
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't look so frightened. You're okay.

393
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The judges would like you to make
six pistachio and praline ice cream cones.

394
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On your marks…

395
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get set…
-Bake.

396
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira chuckling] This is weird.

397
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, just feels like being summoned
into a naughty tent.

398
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just like, we've been naughty, haven't we?

399
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never made ice cream with custard.

400
00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Need to get this crème anglaise
to cool down as soon as I can.

401
00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was weird.

402
00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was strange
being the only person in here.

403
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Made anything like this before?
-Never made ice cream before.

404
00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not a thing, innit?

405
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When the ice cream man
comes over to your road

406
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

You don't go, "Sorry, love,
we make our own."

408
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"We made it already." Yeah.

[Noel] Hello, baker four.

410
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks…
-Get set…

411
00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake.

412
00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know anything
about ice cream, to be honest.

413
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got no idea. Clueless.
[nervous chuckle]

414
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's just start.

415
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The key is to keep an eye
on the custard when it's cooking

416
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so you don't get scrambled eggs.

417
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs to be cooked on the stove
until it gets thickened.

418
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Baker number five.

419
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] On your marks…

420
00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get set…
-Bake.

421
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kevin] I've made ice cream before.
Got an ice cream maker at home.

422
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can do this.
It's just like being at home.

423
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm looking for my custard to thicken up
until it can coat the back of a spoon.

424
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] Going to do it thicker
than my floating island custard.

425
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Baker six,
would you like to join us?

426
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] On your marks…

427
00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get set…
-Bake.

428
00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] Yes, the last one in.

429
00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
First time I'm making ice cream.

430
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
First time I'm seeing this machine.

431
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, let's see. [laughs]

432
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] Crème anglaise is nearly ready.
Happy with the way it looks.

433
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] It's a bit crazy. Staggered.
-[Syabira] I know!

434
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe it's because of the ice cream.
They don't want it melted.

435
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah. That is--
-When the next judges--

436
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite breezy here, isn't it? [chuckles]

437
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, it's very breezy.
-It's like a gale.

438
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] I've made my crème anglaise.

439
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's looking pretty decent.
I'm happy with it.

440
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gonna go to the ice bath.

441
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's cool enough
for the ice cream machine.

442
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>The bakers must reduce</i>

443
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Maxy] In the fridge.

445
00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] <i>But where they cool it is crucial.</i>

446
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can't put a hot crème anglaise
into the freezer.

447
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Er, the temperature difference,
it might cause an issue.

448
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kevin] Into the fridge.

449
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] I chill in the freezer
to get it down as fast as I can.

450

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] Now it can go to the freezer.

453
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandro] It's cooled, which is good.
-[Kevin] Yeah, that's ready.

455
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] I am adding in my pistachio paste.

456
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna add the food colouring.

457
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pistachios shouldn't have too much colour.

458
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It says to churn and then to freeze.

459
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] When it's thick and ice-creamy,

460
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll turn it off,
however long that will take.

461
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Probably take about 45 minutes to churn.
I don't know.

462
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If this works out,
I'll be so proud of myself.

463
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] Now I'm gonna
make the… [snaps fingers]

464
00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
…waffle cones.

465
00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got an idea of how it's done.

466
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

467
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then sift in the flour and icing sugar,
fold in the butter.

468
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

470
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] I'm gonna go for it.

471
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just gonna trust the press.

472

473
00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I give them two minutes
and wait patiently.

474
00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

475
00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

476
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Sandro] Yeah! I'm going for
a golden-y type colour and just roll it.

481
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

482
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] Once done, you need
to roll straight away and let it set.

483
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

485
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

This one is okay. This one also okay.

508
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Make the praline.

pistachio ice cream on holiday.

511
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Matt] From the Algarve.

512
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sort of like, "Oh, they've got pistachio."

513
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

514
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Ron, they've got pistachio, did you want
pistachio. You like pistachio."

515
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"No, just vanilla.
He just wants a vanilla."

516
00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] It's getting there, baby.

517
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just gonna stop churning it.
It's pretty thick.

518
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's done.

519
00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Scrape the ice cream into a bowl
and fold through the praline. Freeze.

520
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Make sure that's all in there.
-Now it can go to the freezer.

521
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] I need this to set quick, quick.

522
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gonna freeze. Should be okay.

523
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abdul] I will be leaving this
in the freezer for as long as possible.

524
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dip the ice cream cone rims
in melted chocolate,

525
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-then in chopped pistachios.
-[Janusz] Pistachios on my wafer.

526
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna put some
melted chocolate in the cone.

527
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-I'll put that in there.

528
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Just gonna do that?
-Yeah.

529
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Like a little secret extra. Wow!

530
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] I hope my ice cream is freezing.

531
00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] I'm gonna see my ice cream.

532
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's too soft.

533
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] It's set, I'm happy, happy.

534
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The freezer is four degree.
It's gonna be melting.

535
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, stress!

536
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm praying really hard silently
so my ice cream set.

537
00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Baker number one,
you have five minutes until judgement.

538
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] It's cold. Everything's cold now.

539
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How many scoops do they want?

540
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll try do two, then I've just gotta
drizzle chocolate sauce.

541
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna do it in the freezer
the rest of this.

542
00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] A little bit of the sauce.

543
00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Baker number two, you have five minutes.

544
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Baker number one, I am coming
to get your bake now for judging.

545
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispering] Happy?

546
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sir. Madam.

547
00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These look quite attractive.

548
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] They've managed
to get two balls on.

549
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The green's right as well,
the colour.

550
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The cone is absolutely lovely. Crisp.
-Hmm.

551
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[mutters]

552
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's nice and creamy,
the ice cream, and set.

553
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The baker has filled the inside--

554
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] With chocolate.
-Stops the ice cream sogging it up.

555
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That is delicious.

556
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales heavily]

557
00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My ice cream didn't set.

558
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy whispering] It's so hard to make.

559
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] It's like water.

560
00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Baker number three,
you have five minutes left.

561
00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Baker number two. I'm coming for ya.

562
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispering] Okay.

563
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

564
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That looks like it's been
in the sun for six hours.

565
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Falling out of the bottom.

566
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cone seems to be crisp enough.

567
00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The praline's good.

568
00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's good flavour, but it's just not set.

569
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] Freezer didn't cool down.
My ice cream is melting.

570
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like I want
to give up this challenge.

571
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If it melts, it melts.

572
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did my best. [chuckles]

573
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Baker number three,
I'm coming to get your bake right now.

574
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[whispering] Thank you.
-Thank you. Ah, it's melting.

575
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll get it there quick.

576
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-There you go.
-[Paul] It's soft. It's not set.

577
00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just like liquid.

578
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Er…

579
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Hmm.
-[Prue exclaims]

580
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's leaking all over. Even down the side.

581
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because the ice cream is so unset,

582
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the praline doesn't have the proper
crunch it should.

583
00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sort of pistachio soup.

584
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] It's fine.

585
00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seems fairly stable.

586
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was gonna do a second scoop,
but I don't think I will.

587
00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Baker number four, your time is up.

588
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The ice cream looks set.

589
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Try a little bit of that cone.

590
00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm, the ice cream tastes nice.

591
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very crunchy praline.

592
00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A shame we didn't get the second scoop.

593
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's a mean ice cream.
Delicious, but not enough.

594
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wonder if the ice cream
is a bit on the soft side.

595
00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm trying to keep it neat.

596
00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Baker number five,
I'm coming for your bake right now.

597
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel whispers indistinctly]

598
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel laughs]

599
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Down to the wire.

600
00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The obvious problem immediately
is that the chocolate

601
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-is just a great ugly lump on top.
-[Paul] Yeah.

602
00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The wafer's good, good texture.
You do get a little bit of praline.

603
00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The ice cream mix itself is good.

604
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is melting very, very quickly.

605
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's melting very quickly. Eesh.

606
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Feels weird, like everyone is watching me.

607
00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Baker number six, your time is up.

608
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

609
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The wafer looks a little too dark
and too brittle.

610
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And they're over-baked.

611
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The ice cream is nice and smooth.
It's just melting pretty quickly.

612
00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[thunder crashing]

613
00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>Paul and Prue will now rank</i>
<i>the ice creams from worst to best.</i>

614
00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whereas Sandro didn't do too well

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

645
00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, you've got these two

646
00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

they're all again smack in the middle.

648
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, you're in this position

Good morning, bakers.
Welcome back to the tent

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for your showstopper challenge.

655
00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Today, Paul and Prue
would like you to bake

656
00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
an exquisitely decorated

657
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Your gateau must consist
of multiple baked layers

658
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and be sandwiched and supported

659
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
by beautifully flavoured,
perfectly set custard.

660
00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can make any style of gateau you like,

661
00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the set custard elements
must be the star of the show.

662
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought Paul Hollywood was the star.

663
00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Used to be, now it's set custard.

664
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Imagine being usurped
by set custard.

665
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a tough business.

666
00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have four hours.

667
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks…
-Get perfectly set…

668
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake!

669
00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] This bake here,
I need this to be perfection.

670
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:11.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's going to be my, like,
"Do I get my Star Baker?"

671
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] It's a personal favourite.

672
00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I'm really excited to make
this and I hope the judges like it.

673
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've had pouring custard.
We've had frozen custard.

674
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, for the showstopper,
we're going to have set custard.

675
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's many different types of custard.

676
00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Crème pat, crème diplomat,
crème mousseline.

677
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There has to be baked elements in there.

678
00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are so many
different avenues they could go down.

679
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, strawberries, I need 400 grams.
I'm gonna just reduce them.

680
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] There are
lots of ways to set custard.

681
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Most people would use flour,
and a bit of gelatine.

682
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It needs to be silky and soft,

683
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it must be firm
so that when you get a slice,

684
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it doesn't bulge out.

685
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am thinking about texture, flavour,
texture, flavour, texture and flavour.

686
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And time. [chuckles softly]

687
00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Custard gateau has to look amazing.

688
00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lots of flavour, lots of colour.

689
00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But custard has to remain the hero.

690
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[laughing] Custard treatment.

922
00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's actually good because all the sugar,
all the butter, is actually moisturising.

923
00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I haven't had a custard treatment

924
00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just set. As long as it's set inside.

927
00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're going to try
and pipe in there, right?

928
00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kevin] Erm, I'm cake-boarding

929
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, like that. All right.
-There you go. Yeah.

933
00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] It's quite wobbly.

934
00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-I'm sharing it with you.

940
00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

941
00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

943
00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

944
00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The dowels aren't keeping it

945
00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Abdul] This is the vanilla custard.

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] If I'm making a cake,
there will be drip on it.

950
00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] Hopefully,
the flavour is piña colada.

951
00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] Really pretty purple roses

952
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] The dried pineapple,
it's gonna be like a flower.

953
00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] Neapolitan ice cream.

954
00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abdul] Trying to decorate

955
00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] I'm very pleased with it.

956
00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kevin] I need more time.

957
00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:03.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] Do you need any help?

958
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kevin] Trying to
pipe that all over. Just…

959
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] I can't stop thinking
of my friend though now.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Janusz] It's three of us. Come on.
-I'm getting a bit overwhelmed.

962
00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a very jiggly cake, babes.
-I know.

963
00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Gonna help Kevin.
-[Abdul] Mmm. Yum, yum, yum!

964
00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've got ten seconds.
What do you wanna do?

965
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Some nectarines.

966
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up.

967
00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] That'll do, that'll do.

968
00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, that's it.

969
00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please step away from your bakes.

970
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, everybody.

973
00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tell me what kind of
witchcraft you used inside.

974
00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro laughs] Witchcraft.

975
00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because that is crazy next-level.

Abdul, would you like
to bring up your showstopper, please?

979
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks absolutely lovely, Abdul.
It looks very professional, quite stylish.

980

981
00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have raspberry and chocolate crème pat,

982
00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
vanilla crème diplomat
with caramelised peaches.

983
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Big enough for you, Prue?
-[chuckles]

984
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Now what are you trying

988
00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The custard in both layers
is definitely the hero.

989
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the texture
of the custard's perfect.

990
00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Okay.

991
00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Probably needed another five minutes
to get a bit of colour as well,

992
00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
more than anything else.

993
00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overall, I like the textures
and the flavours.

994
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've got the idea of
a mille-feuille spot on.

995
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

997
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel whispers] You're welcome.

998
00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul whispers] Thank you. [chuckles]

999
00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1000
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the variety of colours
in the piping. It looks lovely.

1001
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Obviously, the drip.
-And the drip.

1002
00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] There's a chocolate

1004
00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is a ruby chocolate
and strawberry custard

1005
00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and white chocolate and vanilla custard.

1006
00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The proportion of custard
to sponge is good.

1007
00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sponges are nice.

1008
00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the custards are too gloopy
and too dense, too thick on the mouth.

1009
00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's not fresh enough.

1010
00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would've thought all those flavours
would be very fresh.

1011
00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The custard's more like wallpaper paste.

1012
00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't mince words then.
-It is.

1014
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

[softly] You okay?

1017
00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know if it's formal or informal.

1018
00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know whether it's messy
or very attractive or artistic.

1019
00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not quite sure how to look at it.

1020
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I'd say it's slightly messy
and really attractive. [chuckles]

1021
00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] It's eclectic.

1022
00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all] Wow!

1023
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Look at that.
-Look at that.

1024
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think your flavours are great.

1025
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your sponges are good, however…

1026
00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not sure it celebrates
custard and makes it the hero.

1027
00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] This is a beautiful cake.

1028
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sponge is perfect,
the icing is lovely.

1029
00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The problem is, this was supposed
to be about set custard.

1030
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's very little custard
and none of it is set.

1031
00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Maxy.
-Thank you.

1032
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[whispers] Well done, Maxy.
-[Maxy] Thank you.

1033
00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is a piña colada custard cake.

1034
00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I think it looks amazing.

1035
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is so unusual.

1036
00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You actually coated it with custard.

1037
00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's much easier to just
slap buttercream all over it.

1038
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just fantastic.

1039
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Wobble-icious.

1040
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Oh, my goodness.
-[Paul] Wow.

1041
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The amount of custard in there.
-It's great, isn't it?

1042
00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what it's meant to be and it's set.

1043
00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That custard gateau is impressive.

1044
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never had one with so much
custard in it and be that stable.

1045
00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The lime that comes through,
the pineapple and then your coconut,

1046
00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the whole thing together
is just spectacular.

1047
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The other thing that's
impressive about so much custard

1048
00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is that it's not too gluey
and it's not rubbery.

1049
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, you've just hit it right.

1050
00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Look at the wobble on that.
-[Prue] I know, like a jelly.

1051
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, Syabira.

1052
00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Well done.
-[Noel] Well done.

1053
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Smashed it.

1054
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul whispers] Syabira.

1055
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think it looks great, very neat.

1056
00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The piping is absolutely exquisite.

1057
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's both bold and modern
and yet very creative.

1058
00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the bottom tier sponge is coconut
and you've got the mango custard.

1059
00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Well done.

1060
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The second tier in the middle
is a joconde sponge with a coffee custard,

1061
00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the top tier is
a orange sponge… [laughs]

1062
00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
…with a vanilla custard.

1063
00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the bottom one's a triumph.

1064
00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's clever.
The coconut, mango, it's nice.

1065
00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm. I love it.

1066
00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is a wonderfully light sponge.

1067
00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The coffee sponge is very good.

1068
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Coffee custard's a bit glutinous, dry.
-Okay.

1069
00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think every one of those cakes
is highly saleable.

1070
00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely delicious.

1071
00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It would be gobbled up by anybody.

1072
00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-[Sandro] Thank you.

1073
00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Shall I bring this back?
-[Sandro] Thank you.

1074
00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks, mate.
-[whispers] Well done.

1075
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kevin, would you like to bring up your
set custard gateau showstopper?

1076
00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Do you want a hand?
-Yeah, please. [chuckles]

1077
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have we had an earthquake?
-[all laughing]

1078
00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it's literally

1079
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-just dropped as it's opened right up.
-[Kevin] Yeah.

1080
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] All right,
let's have a look at the…

1081
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See if we can get a slice.

1082
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, so what we have here

1083
00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is a dacquoise sponge
topped with honey, thyme, and bay.

1084
00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Set custard topped with raspberry jelly.

1085
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know, that custard is amazing.

1086
00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's so unusual.

1087
00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The more you have it in your mouth,
the nicer it is,

1088
00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it goes beautifully
with the raspberries.

1089
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] The thyme and the bay is amazing.
-[Prue] Hmm.

1090
00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It works really well together.
-[Prue] Mmm-hmm.

1091
00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is delicious.
It's a shame that it looks a mess.

1092
00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah. Thank you.
-Thank you.

1093
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:49.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

1094
00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They were ever so nice about the flavours.
They were really, really nice about it.

1095
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, if there's a bit of hope there,
I'll take it. [laughing]

1096
00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] Feel like I made my friend proud.
I hope I'm in the chance of Star Baker.

1097
00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause you just never really know.
I think Syabira done a really good job.

1098
00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] It's just unbelievable.
I'm just like, "Did I really make that?"

1099
00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like I'm just standing there
and I'm accepting it.

1100
00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But at the same time, I feel like
I'm nearly melting down to the floor

1101
00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause it's just too much to handle.

1102
00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] That didn't went
as well as I planned.

1103
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've made a gloopy custard.

1104
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Definitely that puts me in the bottom.

1105
00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, it's up to judges.

1106
00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Well…
-That was a lot of custard.

1107
00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

1108
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Or not in some cases.
-[Prue] No.

1109
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Janusz was disappointing.

1110
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It wasn't only that
his custards didn't taste great,

1111
00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they were gluey and spreadable.

1112
00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:49.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You said wallpaper paste?
-Yes.

1113
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do you even know?

1114
00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why have you been eating wallpaper paste?

1115
00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughter]
-Shall we talk about Kevin?

1116
00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavour were essentially
the best ones in the tent.

1117
00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They were amazing.
-[Noel] What, thyme and bay?

1118
00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But unfortunately the stability
of the whole gateau

1119
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
was not strong enough, it just collapsed.

1120
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they were set, they were often gloopy,
and if they weren't set, they tasted nice.

1121
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've to get it just right.

1122
00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'll tell you who did,
and that was Syabira.

1123
00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She really triumphed, didn't she?

1124
00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] She had thick custard.
Her flavours were terrific.

1125
00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] It looked great.
-The design was just so modern.

1126
00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about Sandro?

He did a lot of work, didn't he?

1128
00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] He's always ambitious.

1129
00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think two of those cakes
were pretty well perfect.

1130
00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The bottom layer, the mango, stunning.
-Mmm-hmm.

1131
00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who do you think is in trouble?

1132
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think, Kevin.

1133
00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And Janusz is also in line to go now.
-Can't believe that about Janusz.

1134
00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It tasted awful.

1135
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, bakers. That was a tough week.

1136
00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There were some very impressive bakes.

1137
00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But there can only be one Star Baker.

1138
00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the Star Baker this week is…

1139
00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Syabira.

1140
00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1141
00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh! Thank you, guys. Thank you.

1142
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, that leaves me with the horrible job

1143
00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of announcing the person
who will be leaving us this week.

1144
00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you're such a small little gang now,
it's just going to be horrible.

1145
00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The person who's leaving us this week is…

1146
00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kevin.

1147
00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

1148
00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Well done, Kevin.
-Thank you. [laughs]

1149
00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm nothing but proud, really. [laughs]

1150
00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The impostor syndrome is real.

1151
00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And coming into this competition

1152
00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't feel like I deserved a place,
but… [laughs]

1153
00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[imperceptible]

1154
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like I can count myself
as one of this talented bunch.

1155
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like… Oh, my.

1156
00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That custard is just extraordinary.

1157
00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm very sad to see Kevin go,

1158
00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but that custard will remain with me
for the rest of my life.

1159
00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going to go home and do it.

1160
00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think he's invented something wonderful.

1161
00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Syabira got Star Baker again
because that was a proper custard gateau.

1162
00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She just smashed it
on every single department.

1163
00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Aren't you a clever girl? Twice?
-Thank you.

1164
00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn't have imagined
I would get a Star Baker.

1165
00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Second in a row. That's wild.

1166
00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's one crazy journey
that I had this week.

1167
00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:20.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Honestly, insane.

1168
00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] A little bit sad
I didn't get Star Baker

1169
00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because I thought that was pretty close.

1170
00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm feeling good to be back
for another week.

1171
00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're through to quarter-finals, innit?

1172
00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:33.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[woman] Yeah.

1173
00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoo!
