a little bit more crunch.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a real race to get them in the oven
and just to get it in

104
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[James] Right. The main thing is getting
it all done so I've got time to chill it.

107

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Yan] I was going to cut them,
but with this time pressure

109
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's basically easier to pop them out
and slide them off.

110
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not good at cutting,

111
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a little bit easier
and just put them in moulds.

112

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

114
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I don't know if it's the right technique,
but I'm going with it.

116
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's too late to change now.

118
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are literally about that deep,

119
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so it's pretty much a dessert.
It's not a snack.

126
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think we'll do with two hands.

130
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I kind of thought far too long about
the proportions than one really should.

131
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the guide for the shortbread is...
That. Eight millimetres.

132
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About the same caramel.

133
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then it's got just a couple of millimetres
of ganache

134
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then a very, very thin bit
of tempered chocolate on the top.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] And what shape are you doing?

140
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are going to be circles. I'm actually
doing it quite a laborious way.

141
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

142
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then putting a little collar of
acetate around it and then filling it up.

143
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you're making little acetate collars?

144
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's laborious and unfortunately
you tend to get a little bit of leakage.

145
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it is a good idea because you will be
able to see the layers

146
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

what your proportions are.

147
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

to get that amber colour and
it's basically playing caramel chicken.

162
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Sophie] Caramel has a very naughty
habit of crystallising.

165
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So just wiping some water
around the edge of the pan.

166
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[James] So I'm brushing down the sugar
that has gone up the side of the pan

167
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because sometimes if it crystallises
and then gets back into the caramel,

168
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the whole caramel then just starts
to crystallise as well.

170
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it crystallises, it's game over. You've
just got to throw the whole thing away.

171
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

glucose, which helps stabilise

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the sugar molecules, so hopefully
it shouldn't crystallise.

173
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what I've done,
I've made my own peanut butter

202
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then once I've made the caramel,

203
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll add a couple of tablespoons
of peanut butter into that.

204
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How does that react with the caramel?

205
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To be fair, it helps me in the sense
of getting the caramel to set.

206
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like salted caramel is pretty sweet
as it is.

207
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The salty, like peanut butter
sort of balances it out.

208
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got a good feeling about this.

209
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

215
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Kate] Just dragging through
and making little hearts.

301
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] Slightly overdosed
on chocolate layer,

302
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I need to do it all the same now,
which is really annoying.

303
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need it to be even.

304
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tom] I just don't think the caramel
is going to be set.

305
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just tried to pour
my chocolate into it and...

306
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's split.

307
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Bit of a panic.

308
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

309
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] We are really low
on time at the moment.

310
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got to get these in the freezer.

311
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they come out and they sink,
it's not a great deal that we can do.

312
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're on the clock here.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] How long do we have left?

314
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers you have ten minutes left.

315
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ten minutes to bling up
your Millionaire Shortbreads.

316
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] Ugh. Very, very quickly
running out of time.

317
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Let's trial them.

318
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] I'm going to take them out
and put them back in the fridge.

319
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Not sure what's going to happen.

320
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll just give them the full tray.

321
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stacey] Let's have a look.

322
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[James] Please come out in one chunk.

323
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There we go.

324
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Liam] Just worried
they might not pop out.

325
00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

326
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] The caramel's holding.

327
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] I wanted to make sure they set,

328
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
otherwise they will start
oozing out of the sides.

329
00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] It's very, very hot in here
and caramel doesn't like the heat.

330
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How are you doing this, like Banksy?
Like a sort of stencil?

331
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what I want. It's Prue.

332
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow. Maybe you are Banksy.
Because no one knows who Banksy is.

333
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not Banksy.

334
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Only a true Banksy would say
he wasn't Banksy.

335
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] They're still hot.

336
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tom] No, I'm just serving them a slab.

337
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] I'm just going to shove
the rest on the platter just as they are.

338
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Bakers, that is it.
Your time is up.

339
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Meh.

340
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] 12. 14. 16. 18.

341
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tom] Well, I've only got two
to give them.

342
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Two giant sheets of shortbread
as opposed to eighteen.

343
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>It's judgement time</i>
<i>for the signature Millionaire Shortbreads.</i>

344
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hello, Kate.
-Hiya.

345
00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I do like this pattern on the top.
It's quite delicate,

346
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it makes it look quite pretty as well.

347
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's just that they have run
over the edge a bit.

348
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think the biscuit's beautiful
and soft, but it holds its shape.

349
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've got the texture spot on,
actually, and I do like the flavours.

350
00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Get a slight aromatic flavour
from the caramel.

351
00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That aromatic thing is actually the bay.
-[Paul] Yeah.

352
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really like it.

353
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a huge difference between
the shortbread in these two.

354
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's quite doughy.
-Hmm.

355
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavours are sort of there.
The textures aren't, though.

356
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yep.
-[Paul] I think your issue is the base.

357
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hasn't got the texture of a shortbread.
-Yeah.

358
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe it's got too much pecan.
It's a little unpleasant.

359
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I do like the design on top.
I mean you're got some lips there.

360
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Julia] Yeah.
-I'd like to see that nice and flat.

361
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The caramel is bulging out on all of them,
which makes them equal.

362
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the shortbread. Very nutty.

363
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gives it a nice edge, a nice little bit
of crunch to the softness.

364
00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The caramel is a little too salty.
-Okay.

365
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I like the picture of Prue
on the top.

366
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

367
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the flavours.
It's more toffee-like than caramel.

368
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think
the texture of anything is right.

369
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The nutty biscuit is quite coarse
and the chocolate is thick.

370
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's disappointing.

371
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Obviously they're not identical.

372
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've had a bit of an issue
with time as well.

373
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But I can see
it was going to be really interesting.

374
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You had the disc on top of the ganache

375
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
on top of the caramel
on top of the biscuit.

376
00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It's a four layered job.
-Yes, which probably didn't help matters.

377
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very orangey.

378
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The base is a bit dry. However the taste
the soft silky caramel

379
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with the orange as well, together, works.
It is delicious. It is very, very good.

380
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look hideous.

381
00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

382
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] But they taste amazing.

383
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are supposed to be identical
and they look pretty identical.

384
00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can see the layers.
My issue is the thickness of that biscuit.

385
00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-The overall size of it.

386
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it drops through very well though.

387
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Look at that.

388
00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For the first time
I don't like the flavours.

389
00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I don't like the texture
of that caramel. It's far too bitter.

390
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know, but I'll tell you what, Steven,
I mean, for me, I love that caramel.

391
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the bitterness of it. I don't like
really, really sweet things.

392
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the slight bitterness,
the orangey-ness, the macadamia,

393
00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
everything mitigates the caramel.

394
00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are so pretty and they are identical.

395
00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They are very neat.
Very sharp from the side as well.

396
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavours are pretty strong. The rum
comes through very strongly, the chilli.

397
00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a grown up taste.
But I don't really like the rum flavour.

398
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The biggest issue I have is the depth
of that chocolate. It's too thick.

399
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks to me as if you've had
a little time problem?

400
00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I decided to leave them in the tins
because I didn't want to have

401
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Prue] Lovely cracky top.

403
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavour is great.
The caramel is not the right texture

404
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it's too soft
and you didn't finish it.

405
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's all this?

406
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you know Tetris?

407
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.

408
00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I don't know why, but I really wanted
to make a Tetris themed shortbread look.

409
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Love the chocolate on top
because it's nice and neat and flat.

411
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The simplicity of it works.

412
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got a few issues
with the caramel pouring out the side.

413
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The proportions 2 to 1. I like that.

414
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sick.

415
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can you really eat that much caramel?
-Yeah.

416
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The peanut butter in there
is very clever. It's set beautifully.

418
00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's crunchy enough, but again,
soft enough.

419
00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got that nice balance between
the two. But I love that flavour.

420
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is crazy. Oh my God.

422
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Good job.
-Thank you.

423
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Well done, Liam.
-[Paul] Thanks buddy.

424
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

425
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's wild.

426
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, my days. Paul Hollywood shook my hand
because I baked something really good.

427
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was like...crazy. Crazy.

428
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was all right, weren't it?

429
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

430
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I added quite a lot of complexity
to that one, and stupidly,

431
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
obviously I should have just got...
Kept it really, really simple.

432
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tom] I'm still irritated at myself

433
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I know I can finish it
and I know I can do it well.

434
00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know what? The scariest thing
in there was disappointing them because...

435
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the best feeling in the world
when they like it.

436
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So...

Right, bakers,
time for your technical challenge,

439
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

440
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Prue, what caramel trickery
have you conjured up?

441
00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're asking for a Dutch treat.

442
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A Dutch treat.

443
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had one of those once. I can only
remember the first bit of the weekend.

444
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

445
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Off you go. Hold hands. Skip away.

446
00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] So cute.
-Right.

447
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For your technical challenge,
Prue would like you to make

448
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
twelve stroopwafels.
Stroop is the Dutch for syrup...

449
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And waffle means waffle.
-Yeah.

450
00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

451
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got an hour and 45.

452
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] On your marks.
-[Noel] Get set.

453
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both] Bake!

454
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A stroopwafel. Never heard of them
before in my life.

455
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh, well, I know they're Dutch.
That's about it.

456
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, they're very flat,
sort of caramel waffles, aren't they?

457
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Well, I'll give it a crack.

458
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it doesn't work out then yeah, I didn't
really know what it's supposed to be like.

459
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prue, why have you chosen a stroopwafel?

460
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because with any luck,
none of our bakers will have made one.

461
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh, you're cruel.

462
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And they have yeast in them,
which is unusual in a waffle,

463
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but because they're so thin, if they don't
have any yeast it's just too brittle.

464
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they overcook the waffle they will also
be so brittle, they will break anyway.

465
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've got to get it exactly right and
that is the colour they are looking for.

466
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The caramel inside
should be very, very thin.

467
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you break it like that, the caramel
should stretch a bit. That's perfect.

468
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. They're great, aren't they?

469
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The trick is you have to go
low and slow

470
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so that you don't get grainy sugar.

471
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are plenty of things
that can go wrong

472
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and they have only got one to practice on.

473
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wow. Brilliant.
-[Prue laughing]

474
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm beginning to feel a bit mean now.
-No, don't.

475
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've just read the recipe about 12 times.

476
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm making a dough by rubbing the flour
and butter together, which I've done.

477
00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Some yeast, cinnamon and sugar.

478
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Get it in there and give it a mix
and then add the wet.

479
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Going in with my hands now.
I'm going in. I have washed them.

480
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Julia] The waffles I've made before
would be like pancakes

481
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and now we have a dough.

482
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never used a yeasted product
that I haven't kneaded,

483
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'm just going
to give it a little knead.

484
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] Two more for luck.

485
00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm now resting for 30 minutes
and now I'm going to start the caramel.

486
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Make the caramel by melting
the sugar and the butter. Bit sparse.

487
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] Sometimes you can stir it.
Sometimes you can't.

488
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll probably give it a stir anyway.

489
00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's hard to tell if it's up
to the right temperature

490
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
as we don't know
what the right temperature is.

491

[Paul] Let's start with this one.

640
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thickness wise
they are about right, aren't they?

641
00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are all the same colour.

643
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Right texture.

-[Prue] But the caramel's not right.
-[Paul] Caramel's not right. Very grainy.

645
00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Right, shall we look at this one?

646
00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The texture of the waffle is good.
It's quite firm, but it's flexible.

648
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

649
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Same problem. It's very grainy.

650
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. It's identical to the first one.

651
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Now these look like
they've been slightly overdone.

652
00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are quite dry. Breaks very easy,
doesn't it. Doesn't bend at all.

653
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And I think it's very grainy.
Yeah, it is. It's just sugar.

654
00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] They look beautiful,

655
00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but this one has got too much filling in
and it's all on one side.

656
00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Very grainy on the sugar again.

657
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did none of you get the caramel right?

658
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Colour? Quite mottled aren't they?

659
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Much too much filling.

660
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is again too grainy.

661
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm really looking forward
to getting one right.

662
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The waffle's good.
Nice bend to it, that one.

663
00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very grainy on the sugar again.

664
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's a pity
because the waffle is perfect.

665
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Hmm.

666
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Whoever this is struggled
with the cutting.

667
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These ended up being cut by a knife.
How about the middle? Same old problem.

668
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] This is going to be tricky,
judging this lot.

669
00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They are all pretty much even.
There are a couple of darker ones there.

670
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not much of a bend there is there?

671
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Grainy.
-[Prue] This one I pray will work.

672
00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's probably the worst one
we've seen yet.

673
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's an enormous amount of sugar.

674
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Slightly overbaked
and breaks very easily.

675
00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yes. A bit of a mess.

676
00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So even if somebody wins it's not going
to be a complete triumph is it?

677
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] No.
-No.

In ninth place, these stroopwafels.

680
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are overbaked and as you know,
your caramel is very grainy.

681
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Eighth spot is this one. Yan, overbaked
and the sugar wasn't melted.

filled and the caramel is grainy.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Got a little bit of a bend to it,

689
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

She's doing well, I think.

709
00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean,
I loved her Millionaire Shortbread.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the other one I think
that is doing really well is Liam.

711
00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I always love Liam's flavours.

[Sandi] Kate, it sort of feels to me
like she is one of those steady horses

713
00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that sort of comes up on the inside.

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:28.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If Kate pulled off a great showstopper,
she could be Star Baker, couldn't she?

715
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, she could. I mean I think she did,
I think she came sixth in technical,

716
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think her signature was very good.
So yeah, I think she's in a good position.

717
00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

718
00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Tom.
-[Sandi] Not his finest week.

719
00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
His actual Millionaire Shortbread
tasted fine.

720
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The problem is it was still
in the whole tray.

721
00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] <i>James was certainly</i>

722
00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean the base was awful.

723
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, what about Yan? Because I loved her
little Banksy stencils of the Queen.

724
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I think she spends a lot of time
over-complicating things.

725
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] <i>The flavours were fine, but I just</i>
<i>thought the textures were slightly off</i>

726
00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and she came 8th in the technical.

727
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So again, she's in a bit of trouble.

[Noel] Hello, lovely bakers,

730
00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and welcome to your showstopper challenge.

731
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Today, Prue and Paul would love you
to make a caramel cake.

732
00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it needs to be a one tier cake

733
00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with three layers of delicious sponge.

734
00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Any filling you like,
and don't forget, it's a showstopper.

735
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We want to see some powerful decoration.

736
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got to show us
some mad skills on the caramel front.

737
00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And there must be some spun sugar
because we are crazy about the spinning.

738
00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] You've got three and a half hours.

739
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks.
-Get set.

740
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both] Bake.

741
00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After yesterday, caramel is obviously
a sensitive subject for everybody.

742
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've got to bring it home today
because we are all at risk.

743
00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All it takes is for one
unset load of caramel

744
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that's the end of your time here.

745
00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is their chance to really go to town
and show us what they know

746
00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
about that beautiful thing called caramel.

747
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There maybe caramel in the icing.
There will be caramel in the fillings

748
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and there certainly will be caramel</i>

749
00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But there is obviously a danger
that it will be too sweet.

750
00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>You sometimes need another flavour</i>

751
00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so that your palette is distracted
from the pure sugar.

752
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would concentrate on making
a beautiful cake first

753
00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then go to town with the sugar work.
Make that cake dance.

754
00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:25.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] It is Caramel Week, so the emphasis
will be on the caramel decoration.

755
00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Morning James.
-Hello, there.

756
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, tell us all about
your caramel cake.

757
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the sponge is a caramel flavour,
so it's got dark muscovado sugar in there.

758
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've left it a bit gritty so you get
little spots of it through,

759
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so you get that little toffee taste.

760
00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a huge amount of sugar work.

766
00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I can cheat a little bit with
the spun sugar in that I can dip my nuts

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to do the spinning. So...

768
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but still not exactly what I would like.

911
00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

912
00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, bakers, we've got half an hour

913
00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
before we stop the show
to show your showstopper.

914
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Julia] I'm trying to caramelise my nuts.

915
00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, just do whatever I can
with them, really.

916
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] Loads of stuff to do.
I haven't got any room for error here.

917
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] Shall I just do a few more
toffee apples?

918
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] Just filling my egg moulds
with the caramel.

919
00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Yan] The only thing I've got to do
left is spun sugar,

920
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is a necessary requirement.

921
00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] Spun sugar is a bit
of a patisserie chef kind of thing

922
00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and if there is one thing that spun sugar
does not like it's heat and moisture.

923
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So we are all up against it today.

924
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got to be part baker,
part artist, part engineer.

925
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As you flick the fork back and forward
it solidifies in mid-air

926
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and makes a little sugar string.

927
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a weird sensation
considering it's sugar.

928
00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Feels like an old lady's hair
full of hairspray.

929
00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tom] Now this is just not
stringing at all.

930
00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left
to spin spin sugar.

931
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Julia] I'm just going to make a cage
using a ladle.

932
00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[James] Found a bit of plumbing pipe
I found in the garage.

933
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tom] I'm hoping the nest
is perfectly formed

934
00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and that I can prove to the judges
that I'm not bad a caramel.

935
00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very messy job.

936
00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Quite a lot of sugar in your hair.
-Yeah.

937
00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is it supposed to be in there?
-Well, I'm thinning anyway,

938
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but that's a quick way to replace
hair that's lost. Spun sugar.

939
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could just have spun sugar hair, yeah.

940
00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Steven] Yeah.
-[Noel] Spun sugar ponytail.

941
00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We could sell them. Noel and Steven's
Sugar-Spun Ponytails. 3.99.

942
00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, bakers, ten minutes to go.
I know you can do it. Come on.

943
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tom] Right, cakes are cool.
I'm going to ice them.

944
00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tom] It's never going to be super,
super polished because I can't do that.

945
00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I might be a good plasterer, actually.

946
00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Liam] I'm just going to go round
the edges and encourage it to drip.

947
00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sometimes it can just look like
a hot mess, so I don't want that.

948
00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] I'm trying to get
as smooth a finish as I can.

949
00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] It's sexual, isn't it?

950
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] Uh... It's not supposed
to look like that.

951
00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's supposed to be all on the sides.

952
00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] This is my apple
on top of the firework.

953
00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The thing is, it's just getting
so hot it's getting very sticky.

954
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just want it to stick. I just
want it to... I just want to get on.

955
00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My fingers are so sticky.

956
00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Julia] This is going to be fun.

957
00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just stuck. I don't...
Probably because the caramel is so bad.

958
00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not as much of an erection
as I wanted it to be.

959
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Julia] My spun sugar, it just
didn't work, so I need to do something.

960
00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do not move.

961
00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers you have five minutes left. Five.

962
00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Yan] This is going to be the canopy
of the tree.

963
00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stacey] It's not working.

964
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, my gorgeous bakers,
we have one minute.

965
00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't forget that your spun sugar
must be on your cake.

966
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything has gone bleurgh.

967
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[James] Oh, mine's just
sticking and melting.

968
00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] So is mine.

969
00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Bakers, your time is up.

970
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Spun sugar is just going bleurgh.

971
00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>It's time for</i>
<i>the caramel showstoppers</i>

972
00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>to face the judgement of Paul and Prue.</i>

973
00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sophie, would you like to bring up
your caramel cake?

974
00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Very, very elegant.

975
00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

976
00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously humidity
has attacked the caramel

977
00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because the nest was much bigger.

978
00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] But beautiful mirror glaze.

979
00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Hazelnut chocolate.

980
00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's not to like?
-Yeah.

981
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The light buttercream you've got
in there as well is delicious, like silk.

982
00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Delicious. I'm very impressed
with the eggs.

983
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've got salted
caramel inside, have they?

984
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Yes, they have. Yep.

985
00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

986
00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] How can you eat
that much caramel, Paul?

987
00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's a skill. That is magnificent.
Thank you.

988
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a little bit on the simplistic side.

989
00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have spent so much time
on all the extras

990
00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and they're not really part of the cake.

991
00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flavour's lovely. Real caramel taste.

992
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the brittle.
You can feel it in your teeth.

993
00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It tastes likes you've over-mixed
the sponge because it's a bit rubbery.

994
00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it looks really appetising.

995
00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love this drip effect as well.
It works you know.

996
00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great colour on that cake.

997
00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] What's so good is the contrast
of the buttercream and the cake.

998
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gingery, treacly, lovely.

999
00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bake is good. The textures good.

1000
00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you should be very proud
of yourself with that cake.

1001
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the colours, I love
the butterflies, its just wonderful.

1002
00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cake however, the icing on the cake
more specifically is too thin.

1003
00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just run off.

1004
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks slightly slimy
rather than luscious.

1005
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Delicious chocolate cake.
Texture's perfect.

1006
00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got a delicate flavour in there
and it's baked well.

1007
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My big issue is the finish.

1008
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The shards are nicely done. They are nice
and thin and I bet they are crackly.

1009
00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But on the walnuts I think
your caramel was a bit too thick.

1010
00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I actually love the taste of the cake,
I think it's beautiful.

1011
00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um, the poppy seed really works in it.

1012
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've created
quite an elegant cake.

1013
00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've ticked all the boxes. Well done.

1014
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you so much.

1015
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that is fantastic.

1016
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The spun sugar, the cinder toffee,
the caramel river. Ingenious. Yeah.

1017
00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very original.

1018
00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we've got an animal print
in the middle of our cake?

1019
00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Wow.
-[Prue] It's very clever.

1020
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The sponge is a little bit tough.

1021
00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Love the flavours. That blend between
the chocolate and the orange

1022
00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
works really well.
It is slightly overbaked.

1023
00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It looks like something out
of Game of Thrones. It is very clever.

1024
00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The mirror glaze is absolutely
extraordinary. It's so shiny.

1025
00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The, um... Okay.

1026
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] How do you get in there? Crunch.

1027
00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, look at that.

1028
00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your cake is far too stodgy.

1029
00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's too solid.

1030
00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Overall, a bit disappointed.

1031
00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the look's great,
but the inside has the issue.

1032
00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've got the spun sugar
as the nest

1033
00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you've got a bit of nut brittle
on the side. It's quite basic isn't it?

1034
00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because this is a caramel cake
the centrepiece should be caramel,

1035
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
although they're very pretty, the flowers,
I think they've not done you a service.

1036
00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay.

1037
00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, Tom! It is gluey, it's underbaked,
it's got no crumb.

1038
00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] How did you manage with those
beautiful ingredients to create that?

1039
00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did you make it at home?
-Yes, but as muffins.

1040
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I think because they are smaller
they cook better.

1041
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In hindsight, as a cake,
probably not the right recipe to use.

1042
00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] The butter icing is nice.
-[chuckles]

1043
00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's something.
-[Prue] It's got passionfruit

1044
00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I'm glad to say that you left
the pips in, which I love.

1045
00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the crunch.

1046
00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are so many colours in there
and they are really clear and bright.

1047
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I love the toffee apples.
They look great.

1048
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just can't wait to try this, actually.

1049
00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Wow.
-[Paul] Wow.

1050
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wonderful apple flavour.

1051
00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really good and light.

1052
00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, that's beautiful.

1053
00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The apple, I've just had a big piece
of apple with the cake. That's delicious.

1054
00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And actually, the cream cheese frosting
when you eat it together again,

1055
00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
another level.

1056
00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the apple is masterful in there.

1057
00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the cake is sensational.

1058
00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Very well done.
-[Prue] Well done. Very well done.

1059
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:49.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much.
-[Paul] Thank you.

1060
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What did you think of
their mad caramel skills?

1061
00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was really impressed with
the imagination of what they did.

1062
00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Kate did very well.

1063
00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know, I think
that was the best tasting cake.

1064
00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I asked her for the recipe because
I have got to know how to make that cake.

1065
00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And Liam stayed up there, didn't he?

1066
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] He did. Again beautifully spiced

1067
00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and with that hint of ginger
that sits on your tongue at the end.

1068
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was very, very good.

1069
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you're looking at the people
that are in a little bit of trouble,

1070
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:20.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd say Tom. That, unfortunately,
was not a good cake.

1071
00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I felt for him though because...
-I felt for him, too.

1072
00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He knew he had an off day.

1073
00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
James' cake was dry.

1074
00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He went caramel on everything,

1075
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the problem was he didn't put
the caramel parts on the cake.

1076
00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like we're having
a bag of sweets with your cake.

1077
00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, we don't envy you having to decide.

1078
00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But what Noel and I both want to know
is how sick you're feeling. Paul?

1079
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, dear. The amount of sugar.
I crave a bag of crisps.

1080
00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Oh, good. Something healthy
to get yourself back on track.

1081
00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

1082
00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well done, bakers,
on your caramel crusade.

1083
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, this week, I've got the great job
of announcing Star Baker.

1084
00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the Star Baker this week
made some pretty fine shortbread,

1085
00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but in the showstopper
produced a cake so banging

1086
00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that the judges wanted the recipe.

1087
00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Set off the sugar fireworks
because this week's Star Baker is...

1088
00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kate.

1089
00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you joking me?

1090
00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all applauding]

1091
00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

1092
00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Well done. Well done.

1093
00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So that means I get to do the next bit,
which I absolutely hate,

1094
00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I'm afraid
somebody has to leave the tent.

1095
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the person we're saying
goodbye to today is...

1096
00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tom.

1097
00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so sorry.

1098
00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Justified. [chuckles]

1099
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was a bad cake.

1100
00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] I'm so sorry.
-[Tom] It was a terrible cake.

1101
00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Unlucky, buddy.
-[Tom] No, no it's fine.

1102
00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Disappointed to be leaving,
but I did a really bad cake

1103
00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and everyone else did excellent cakes

1104
00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I think it's totally fair.

1105
00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Going to miss you.

1106
00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Poor Tom, because he really did make
a mess of it.

1107
00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That cake was raw.
It was just an off day for him.

1108
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You were a little bit lucky.

1109
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, I know. Don't I know it.

1110
00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Scraped through again. I need a beer.
[laughs]

1111
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sad for Liam because he thought
he was going to get Star Baker.

1112
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my days.

1113
00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] You want to stay up there.
