00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

As it bakes, as the choux puffs
it splits it apart so you get craquelin.

306
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They’re not far off.

[Noel] <i>And it’s even harder</i>

308
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Kate] Should be nice and crispy.
-[Steven] Coming out the oven.

309
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They’re a bit softer
but the craquelin on top was burning.

310
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I should have done them
at a lower temperature.

311
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What was that tap? They sound good.

312
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn't... It didn't achieve anything.
I don't know.

313
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look a bit burnt in places.

314
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The craquelin’s come out really nice.

315
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just a case of assembling now.
Getting these cooled down.

316
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have half an hour.
Just 30 minutes left.

317
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really pushed for time now actually.
It’s going to be tight.

318
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to start piping these now.

319
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Frangipane. Right, let’s get this done.

320
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I’m filling the buns
with vanilla and chestnut mousse.

321
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what’s happening here now?

322
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, so I’m glazing them quickly.

323
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yep.

324
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ve done it wrong.

325
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re supposed to fill them first
before I glaze them.

326
00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve done it wrong. I’ve done it wrong.
I’ve done it wrong.

327
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the peach Bellini.

328
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like I’m your carer
and I’m just coming in to visit you.

329
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So how’s it going for you here?
So you’re making choux-nicorns.

330
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m making choux-nicorns.

331
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, I’m going to send the nurse in.

332
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh.

333
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Filling up my crème diplomat.
Making sure I get them full.

334
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pierced right the way through
the choux bun.

335
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, and it’s come out the side.

336
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the orange crème pat.

337
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s limey, which is just what I wanted.

338
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't know how long I’ve got.

339
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have just 15 minutes left.

340
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not very much time left at all.

341
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ve got to get these iced as well.

342
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uniformity is key.

343
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They don't look like something
you’ll see in a pastry window.

344
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s messier then I would like.

345
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just trying to get rid of the excess
because I don't want it to drip down.

346
00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They’re not identical, that’s for sure.

347
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve got to show
that I can make something look pretty.

348
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gonna be a bit of a crazy dash
to the finish line.

349
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gold leaf makes everything look better.

350
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do they look like horns to you?

351
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up.

352
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God.

353
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, bakers, your time is up. Stacey!

354
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m trying to put them on.

355
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stacey!

356
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please place your signature choux buns
at the end of your station.

[Sandi] <i>The semi-finalists' choux buns</i>

358
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello, Steven.

359
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look a bit untidy. And burnt.

360
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They’re quite flat.

361
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think your craquelin
was probably a little bit too thick.

362
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has restricted the growth.

363
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Let’s have a go.

364
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. Okay.

365
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I definitely think this is under baked.
The choux pastry is too soft.

366
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very soft. I think the craquelin has
kidded you into thinking they’re ready.

367
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it tastes great though.

368
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It tastes exactly like a key lime pie.

369
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is absolutely delicious.
It just doesn't look good.

370
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you’ve done this on purpose
so they don't say style over substance.

371
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bakewell ones
look very untidy as well.

372
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Yeah.

373
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s a bit too sweet for me.

374
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bloody gorgeous, mate.

375
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They just taste heavenly but look awful.

376
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you have to eat it like that.

377
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Just dim the lights.

378
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They do look beautiful.
Very nice shine on the chocolate.

379
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All of those are the same size.

380
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They do look a little bit flat.
I think it’s under baked.

381
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

382
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
See how white that is there?
That could be darker.

383
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

384
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s kidding you that it’s ready.

385
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So as it's sat and rested,
it’s just collapsed slightly.

386
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s have a look.

387
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't get the rhubarb.
I get the strawberry.

388
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The strawberry is stronger
than the rhubarb.

389
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Great flavour though.

390
00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the craquelin’s nice and crisp.

391
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Now these look a bit flat as well.

392
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s very nice but I'd have liked
lots more chestnut.

393
00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:22.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s drowned by the chocolate.

394
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I almost feel
a tinge bit of disappointment.

395
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, don't say that.

396
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:32.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the semi-final and we really
are after absolute perfection.

397
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think they look really lovely.

398
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the ones with the brown craquelin
are the same size

399
00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and all the ones with the heart
look roughly the same size.

400
00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The craquelin has worked.
I think the colour is good.

401
00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s a beautiful golden brown.
We’ll start with the Valencia orange.

402
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

403
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is how I like to see
the choux pastry.

404
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Soft in the middle
and crisp on the outside.

405
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. Very nice orange taste.

406
00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The craquelin, it’s unbelievable.

407
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the filling is delicious too.

408
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just think
you could have had more in there.

409
00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

477
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

is getting those layers.

479
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

494
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flavour them.
This is the lemon zest in this one.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

496
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

549
00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I’ve got to temper the chocolate.

552
00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Melt it. Use it.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] To temper chocolate,
you heat it to a certain degree.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to raise the temperature
to loosen up all the crystals

557
00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then we’re going to reform them
by cooling it quickly.

558
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

559
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe cool it down with some ice actually.

560
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know what?
I’m going to do it the sexy way.

Using a slab to cool the chocolate
and then do a bit of that.

562
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pour over the acetate.

563
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Leave to set slightly.

564
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll probably stick it in the fridge
if I was setting it

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I don't think
it wants to be in the fridge.

566
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not a clue.

567
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Score it.

568
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m not even going to look round
to see what everyone else is doing

569
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I can guarantee you now
that it’s probably not the same.

570
00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

571
00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I can see that.

572
00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s not really scoring very well.
That’s not set.

573
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you think if we just stand
and stare at it something will suddenly...

574
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

575
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ve just got to wait
till it’s that perfect consistency

576
00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so that you can score a line
and it won’t close back up again.

577
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. "Leave to set in the chef's rings."
Why have they given us two rings?

578
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have a wave of...

579
00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then it would have to be like
a curled triangle? Can’t envisage it.

580
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
firm but smooth crème au beurre
and light, airy, joconde sponge.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, we'll start with this one.

602
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I rather like the harsh colouring
because it looks so pretty

603
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the chocolate is a bit of a mess.

604
00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s see what it tastes like.

605
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The crème au beurre is quite nice
and so is the joconde.

606
00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

607
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, moving on. I quite like this.
Looks very neat.

608
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m very impressed with the chocolate
and it’s held its shape beautifully.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I agree. Let’s have a quick look.
Well, it cuts very nice.

610
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
joconde’s good. It’s light, it’s airy.
Pistachio is there as well.

611
00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Moving onto this. It looks untidy.

613
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There’s no definitive layers there.

614
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This raspberry in the middle
looks a right mess.

615
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:39.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It tastes lovely but it’s hardly
the elegant patisserie that we were after.

616
00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, moving onto the last one.
This looks quite neat actually

617
00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but pistachio could have done
with being a little bit greener.

618
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chocolate curl is a bit too gold,

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

like curds and mousses or creams.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the mousse.

929
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pretty hot in here now.

930
00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] The heat’s starting
to rise a little bit

931
00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I can hear it around the room as well.

932
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Are you all right?

933
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lot of cracks. Going to try
and cover them up.

934
00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Oh, look at my basket.

935
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ugh.

936
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s how hot it is in here.
It is literally melting chocolate.

937
00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s holding.

938
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, bakers, you have five minutes.
Five minutes.

939
00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is horrible to watch.

940
00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m worried about this one
because it’s got a crack in it.

941
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s just siting quite nicely on itself.

942
00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Stop faffing around with it.
That's what we need to do.

943
00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s very, very fiddly.

944
00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Start piping anywhere
where there is a sort of hole or crack.

945
00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that crack is bad, isn’t it?

946
00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just got to get the clouds on.

947
00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They’re supposed to be kissing.

948
00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God.

949
00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hate rushing.

950
00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One minute left.

951
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Oh.

952
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do not crack on me.

953
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, unfortunately your time is up.

954
00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Step away from your Showstopper.

955
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please put your Showstoppers
at the end of your benches.

956
00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] The semi-finalists'
meringue centrepieces

957
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
now face the judgement of Prue and Paul.

958
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My Showstopper wasn't as good
as it has been but hopefully it’s enough.

959
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stacey] <i>It doesn't look too bad. </i>

960
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If this is the end of the road for me,
I’m leaving happy with what I’ve done.

961
00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] <i>I don't really know</i>
<i>how it stands up to anyone else’s.</i>

962
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All I know is the rainbow stands up.

963
00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There’s so much there that’s wrong.

964
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hope they see the effort
that went into it.

965
00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sophie, please bring up
your meringue centrepiece.

966
00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

967
00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks like a hat.

968
00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Oh, no, it’s not, it’s a tutu.

969
00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It just looks like a hat.
-I would love to see you wear that.

970
00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What, the tutu or the hat?

971
00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seriously, I’m game for both.

972
00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think
the design is very, very good.

973
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think your piping is good.

974
00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the bake on the bottom,
is that the French meringue?

975
00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

976
00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's split an awful lot.

977
00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

978
00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very nice meringue.

979
00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Swiss and the French is very good.
Baked well as well.

980
00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Crispy, which is what
you need to be the base.

981
00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How many layers
have you got to this opera cake?

982
00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nine, I think.

983
00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It should be seven.

984
00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I had to fill it up.

985
00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that not good?

986
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It tastes amazing.
The coffee mousse lightens it up

987
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the ganache is quite heavy
because it’s so thick.

988
00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you had done the ganache
a little thinner

989
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it would have been ten out of ten.

990
00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I’m highly impressed.

991
00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Awesome.
-Very well done.

992
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

993
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Phew. Thank God for that.

994
00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kate, would you like to bring up
your meringue Showstopper please.

995
00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Oh, wow.

996
00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wow.
-It’s colourful. Bit childish.

997
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the colours are just amazing.

998
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They just shine out at you.

999
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just love the look of it.
I think it’s fantastic.

1000
00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The rainbow itself is a little uneven.

1001
00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Needed to be neater.
-Yeah.

1002
00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Every single colour
is a different fruit flavour.

1003
00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Definitely raspberry. I like that.

1004
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I get the different flavours.
They're a bit like sweets.

1005
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it’s wonderful.

1006
00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve got and Italian meringue
on the bottom,

1007
00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which I’ve lightly blowtorched.

1008
00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Delicious.

1009
00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavours, the creams, the Swiss
meringue are all absolutely lovely.

1010
00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s a bit of
a splat of flavour and colour.

1011
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me it sort of
freaks me out a little bit.

1012
00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have to release your mind.

1013
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is absolute celebration of fruit
and cream and meringue.

1014
00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is Kate on a plate.

1015
00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1016
00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] I love that. Well done, Kate.
-Thank you.

1017
00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1018
00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Stacey, would you like to bring
your meringue Showstopper up to the table?

1019
00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A centrepiece needs to be
easily recognisable for what it is.

1020
00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are obviously birds.

1021
00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s quite simplistic
but you’ve thought it through well.

1022
00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope it tastes as good as it looks.

1023
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s a nice meringue that.
-Mmm. Very good.

1024
00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s chewy.

1025
00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now this is the Italian meringue.

1026
00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s just too sweet and sticky.

1027
00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you can only bear
a little bit of that.

1028
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It’s just very, very soft.

1029
00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One is filled with a vanilla panna cotta
and raspberry coulis

1030
00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the other one is filled
with a raspberry lemon mousse.

1031
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s like a takeaway dish isn’t it?
-It is. It is.

1032
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s probably not
the best thing in the world

1033
00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it’s very practical for what it does.

1034
00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s just very tart.
-[Stacey] Sorry, too much coulis.

1035
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s very nice.
You have the sweetness underneath.

1036
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s very creamy.

1037
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That’s quite tart as well.

1038
00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All of that meringue is so sweet,

1039
00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you really do need
something sharp to go with it.

1040
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done, Stacey.
-Thank you.

1041
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1042
00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Steven, please bring up
your meringue centrepiece.

1043
00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was a hot air balloon and a basket.

1044
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It got too close to the sun.

1045
00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Icarus.

1046
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Exactly. Yes.

1047
00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The colours are just lovely.
I love those pastel shades.

1048
00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I imagine if the chocolate basket
was still intact, you’d get it.

1049
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-But just looking at that,

1050
00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would think it was a tree.

1051
00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Psychedelic tree.
-Yeah, a psychedelic tree.

1052
00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I wouldn’t think it was a balloon.
-What happened with the cracking?

1053
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It took one crack
and then the weight just...did that.

1054
00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That shouldn't have happened.

1055
00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you make a centrepiece you need it
to last for four or five hours.

1056
00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay.

1057
00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So the top one is an Eton Mess?

1058
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Balsamic, strawberry and a clotted cream.

1059
00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour’s nice.

1060
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Execution? Probably not and that
comes down to the bake.

1061
00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What you should've done was bake it
for longer to dry it out totally

1062
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to give it a more stable base.

1063
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s such a pity,
because it’s so delicious.

1064
00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now this is the Italian?

1065
00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s the Italian meringue
with the lemon drop pie.

1066
00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s so good.

1067
00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s great. Very light.

1068
00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Love the flavours. They taste amazing.
I mean, beautiful.

1069
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just think the method,

1070
00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the way you’ve done it
is not up to normal Steven standard.

1071
00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Steven.
-Thank you.

1072
00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>Prue and Paul must now decide</i>
<i>who deserves Star Baker </i>

1073
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and who must miss out</i>
<i>on the chance to become champion.</i>

1074
00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Showstopper. It’s the semi-final.
Couldn't be more important.

1075
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who stood out for you?

1076
00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I really liked Kate’s
because it looks fantastic.

1077
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The colours are wonderful.

1078
00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought the flavours
and textures, spot on.

1079
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about Sophie?

1080
00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sophie showed
the most skill in the Showstopper.

1081
00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With the meringue,
which is perfectly baked

1082
00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and exactly the right texture.

1083
00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So does that mean that Sophie
and Kate are both in line for Star Baker?

1084
00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes. But it is ridiculously tight.
-It is tight.

1085
00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to say I’m really none the wiser
in terms of who is going to be leaving us.

1086
00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Coming into today, Stacey
was in a very difficult position.

1087
00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She was down at the bottom.

1088
00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think when you break it down,
what she’s done is very simple.

1089
00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She’s piped a flamingo, baked them off

1090
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and leaned them against
a couple of puddings.

1091
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it does look like a centrepiece
and it tastes delicious.

1092
00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Steven has been so ambitious
that he hasn't quite achieved it.

1093
00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the colours
and I love the flavours.

1094
00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] The flavours.

1095
00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it’s not clear cut,
which is seems it isn’t,

1096
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
do you then give yourselves
the luxury of having a look back?

1097
00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Initially, we’ve got to look
at this weekend very closely

1098
00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and if that still doesn't
draw any obvious answers

1099
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it's so close then yes.

1100
00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have to look back retrospectively
on the whole series.

1101
00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s only happened a couple of times.

1102
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is utterly horrifying. It’s so close.

1103
00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You just don't want
to make the wrong decision.

1104
00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just wanted to say
before you hear the results,

1105
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this has been the hardest decision that
I’ve been involved with in eight years.

1106
00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, let’s start with the good news.

1107
00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I get to announce Star Baker.

1108
00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This was a person
who delivered on Misérables,

1109
00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
made everybody extremely happy,

1110
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
who danced away with the Showstopper.

1111
00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This week’s Star Baker is Sophie.

1112
00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1113
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

1114
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That means I’ve got
the horrible job of announcing

1115
00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which one of you guys is not going
to make it to the final,

1116
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which at this stage,
I know is the cruellest blow.

1117
00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was so tight as Paul said.

1118
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sadly, the person who won’t be joining us
in the final is...

1119
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stacey.

1120
00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I’m sorry.
-Okay.

1121
00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sorry, darling.
-It’s okay.

1122
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So close.

1123
00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You did an amazing job. An amazing job.

1124
00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m pleased I’ve gone out on a high.

1125
00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know,
it was a really, really difficult decision

1126
00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for them and that's great.

1127
00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Stacey should be really,
really proud of what she’s achieved.

1128
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, she’ll be disappointed today

1129
00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the truth is she has done
something remarkable.

1130
00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can go back to
being a good mum so it’s okay.

1131
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could have waited another week
but it’s fine.

1132
00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s fine.

1133
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had accepted my fate.
I was going. I was going home.

1134
00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I’m in the finals. I can’t,
I cannot believe it. I cannot believe it.

1135
00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have three great bakers
going into the final.

1136
