00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's my stalker. Don't worry.

204
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The dame can appear anywhere.
It's like <i>Rentaghost.</i>

205
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She can just pop up anywhere.
-Yeah.

206
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When I wake up in the morning,

207
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-she's at the end of my bed.
-Is she? That's… quite scary.

208
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That sounded weird.
-Pretty weird.

209
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's better than Paul being there.

210
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you are halfway through.

212
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite hot in there.
I don't want them to overprove.

213
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] <i>The extra fat in an enriched dough,</i>

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>as well as the addition of the fruit</i>

215
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me just check.

216
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>But if the bakers remove</i>

-Please prove.

218

219
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got another prove yet anyway,
so we'll go with it.

220
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Say got a bit longer.

221
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He always says it's not proved.

222
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Just do it a bit longer.

223
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Watch him say it's overproved this week.
-Oh, don't say that.

224
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If he says that, I'll look the other way.

225
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[both laugh]
-[Cristy] I'm just gonna get it out.

226
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] It's huge.

227
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pretty good. Erm, it's nice and proved.

228
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Saku] Perfect.

229
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] I'm gonna mix in this filling.

230
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think blueberry
is that strong a fruit.

231
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just a nice blend.

232
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Need to put a very thin layer.

233
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hope Paul loves these nuts.
These fine nuts. [chuckles]

234
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] If I can make sure
that they're even weight,

235
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it should mean they end up
looking somewhat the same.

It's thinner on one end. So annoying.

238
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

242
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

243
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

like Yorkshire puddings.

246
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

247
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

they'll start joining together.

250
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

so it'll get nice and brown when baked.

258
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

It's really faint.

280
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ten minutes to get your buns out the oven.

288
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going to give it a nice glaze,

289
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] Quite pleased with that colour.

291

[Tasha] I've got my mulled wine glaze
and it will kind of melt into the pastry.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

sprinkle some cinnamon.

296
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never done that before,
let's see how that turns out.

297
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tasha] A bit of glitter.

298
00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] I wanted the two-tone,
lemon and blueberry.

299
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Saku] Oh, my word. Two more to go,
not enough space.

303

304
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hope they live up

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The issue is consistency or inconsistency
of the shape and colour.

342
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's not two alike. It's a shame.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

358
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

360
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your balance of cardamom is just lovely.

361
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavour combination
between the cardamom and the cinnamon

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

369
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The blueberry's become a carrier
for the cinnamon.

370
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

with the lemon running through it.

372
00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

You've rolled the dough thin,

They're very even. You managed the cross.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

some nice consistency. What is it again?

389
00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

didn't I?

It's time for your technical challenge.

This one has been set
for you by the delightful Prue.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Prue, any words of wisdom?
-Yes.

416
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-Aw.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue would like you to make
a beautifully decorated

lemon and thyme drizzle cake.

423
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're looking for a light moist sponge
that is soaked with lemon and thyme syrup

424
00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and a sprinkling of crystallised
lemon and thyme.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison] On your marks…

-Bake.

428
00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God. Right.

429
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Interesting cake. [laughs]

430
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I imagine it's gonna take a bit of time.

431
00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No pun intended.

432
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This challenge is right up your street,
you've come as a lemon.

433
00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both laugh]

434
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just wanna point out at this moment
in time that you've come as thyme.

435
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

436
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue, tell us about
your lemon and thyme drizzle cake.

437
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It is just a cream sponge
baked in a fancy tin,

438
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the difference is
it has a lot of thyme in it.

439
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What I'm worried about most is, I think,
they won't put enough in it.

440
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Only a bit
and it'll just be a lemon drizzle cake.

441
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] They've got the tin.

442
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they don't grease it properly, Paul,
as you know that cake will stick.

443
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on, I'm dribbling now, I need a bite.
My goodness, that's a fair slice.

444
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] That big enough?
-Yes.

445
00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh, yeah.

446
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is moist from the drizzle.

447
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The lemon and thyme
work beautifully together.

448
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's absolutely lovely.
-Hmm.

449
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me,
it'll come down to flavour and balance

450
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
between the thyme and lemon.
Are they gonna get it right?

451
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gotta have lots of thyme.

452
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's ironic is we've only given
them an hour and a half.

453
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] I know.

454
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Instruction number one,
"Make the cake mixture."

455
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fabulous.

456
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's been so long
since I've made a sponge cake.

457
00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I haven't made one in yonks.

458
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm creaming the butter
and the sugar together, adding the lemon.

459
00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tasha] Self-raising flour.

460
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dana] Get that mixed in on a low speed.

461
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Cristy] This'll be enough.

462
00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Saku] It's a light, fluffy sponge.

463
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] You ever made one before?
-I've made lemon drizzle cake.

464
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You have?
-But not with thyme.

465
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You know?
-Yeah.

466
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thyme for roast, not a cake.
-It's in food. Not normally in a bake.

467
00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe it will taste like
roast dinner. [laughs]

469
00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They told us how much lemon to use,
but not how much thyme to use.

470
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What I would normally do
is just add only a little.

471
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Baker's instinct. Prue said, "Be bold."

472
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prue, I'm with you, sister.

473
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Try and get the thyme
really in there, you know?

474
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] Couple of heaped tablespoons.

475
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did not measure the amount of thyme
I was putting in. Risky.

476
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It does smell strong.

477
00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't smell anything. Bit more thyme.

478
00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just preparing the cake tin
with some butter, so it doesn't stick.

479
00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's hard to do.

480
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a risk of things catching,
so you want it to come out.

481
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] I'm gonna give it a dusting
with some flour.

482
00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dana] I've put more thyme in.

483
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can see all the green specks,
so I'm hoping it'll be fine.

484
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] Slap it down
so it gets into all those crevices.

485
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Cristy] Get it in.

486
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-No.

487
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Alison] Not really. Oh.

488
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

-Just bake it.

It's gonna take a while in the oven.
It's a big cake. Definitely 40 minutes.

491
00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Juice of two lemons,
sugar and thyme, right.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Egg white, dip the thyme leaves in

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

506
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I'm gonna put sugar on to it

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

559
00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

562
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

This is a thicker icing.

there's not enough thyme in there.

603
00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

604
00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a bit coarse too.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the icing is a bit clumsy.

-[Prue] Lot more thyme.

609
00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's slightly overbaked.

610
00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite clever because the baker
has put thyme in one

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The lemon isn't properly crystallised.

[Paul] Last one. I like the look of this.
Pretty neat on the baking as well.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the way the icing is confined
to small ribbons down the runnels.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I genuinely never thought
I'd get first in the technical.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] She did not do a good technical,

-She did.

664
00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

are in worse trouble than the rest.

667
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Matty, why did he do
so bad in the signature?

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

672
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

673
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

678
00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can choose any style of dessert,
but it must include

679
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a significant baked element.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you should celebrate florals
though your flavours and design.

681
00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

682
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Something you could serve at a picnic
or wear as a headdress at Glastonbury.

683
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

685
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Experimenting with different
floral flavours, not my comfort zone.

686
00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anything that I can mess up on,
I tend to stay clear.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it sounds quite, like, potion-y.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we're asking the bakers
for a layered dessert.

691
00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] We're talking jellies, ganaches,

692
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
bavarois, mousse, biscuits,
anything they wish.

693
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

695
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The overall flavour is floral.

696
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The trouble with flowers
is one second there's not enough flavour,

697
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then you go over the top
and then they taste like soap.

698
00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dandelion syrup.

699
00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It should taste incredible,

700
00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and, of course, look like a showstopper.

701
00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hello.

702
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then I'm doing
a opera style floral dessert.

704
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you say opera,
how many layers are you using, seven?

705
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

707
00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. Are you using chocolate at the top?

708
00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I'm putting, erm, meadowsweet butter--

1036
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] It's very pretty.

1037
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very pastel
which suits the tent beautifully.

1038
00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your flowers and your jelly work
is really beautiful.

1039
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Distinctive lines.

1040
00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Distinctive colour.
-[Prue] Very good texture.

1041
00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just set, which is what you want.

1042
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Saku] Thank you.

1044
00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The ginger is the overwhelming flavour.

1045
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not getting much flavour
in anything else.

1046
00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, I'm hunting for anything.

1047
00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Is this raspberry?

1048
00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is hibiscus.

1049
00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hmm.
-[Paul] Hmm.

1050
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's so mild,

1051
00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you need to carry a big punch in this

1052
00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-to make it work.
-Okay.

1053
00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All your textures are spot on,
but your flavours are lacking.

1054
00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so sorry.

1055
00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, Saku.

1056
00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Thank you.

1057
00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's certainly imaginative.

1058
00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

1059
00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It left the edges exposed
which I quite like.

1060
00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do ya?
-That's where you are like an opera cake.

1061
00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very nice, even layers.

1062
00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I never thought I'd say this, but I think
there's actually too much floral.

1063
00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-[Prue] It's very perfumed.

1064
00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mostly elderflower.
That's the strongest, isn't it?

1065
00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hmm, that's really sharp.
Probably too sharp for what this is.

1066
00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I get the meadowsweet as well.
Bit like freshly cut grass.

1067
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-It's got that flavour.

1068
00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is certainly a strong botanical feel
to this, which is what we wanted.

1069
00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very good choux too.

1070
00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Overall, you've done a decent job.

1071
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks.
-[Paul] Thanks.

1072
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-[Dan] Cheers.

1073
00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Whether it's a showstopper, I'm not sure.

1074
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-I'm not so sure.

1075
00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flowers would have been
better if you'd done a pile,

1076
00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then sort of cascaded it down.

1077
00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, they're a little
like soldiers in a row.

1078
00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's see what it's like inside.

1079
00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh-huh.

1080
00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison] Ooh!

1081
00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] You've got your layers
nicely separated.

1082
00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, the lemon…

1083
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Got elderflower with it?
-[Matty] Yeah.

1084
00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Not strong.

1085
00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn't quite meet the botanical brief.
One feels it's a lemon cake.

1086
00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think your custard layer
is too stodgy and a bit rubbery.

1087
00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's very rubbery.

1088
00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is delicious,
but it isn't a showstopper.

1089
00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you. Cheers.
-Thank you.

1090
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel and Alison] Well done.

1091
00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

1092
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's beautiful.

1093
00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks great.

1094
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1095
00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It has split on the outside.
It looks very pretty.

1096
00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the work here on the top.

1097
00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very skilful injecting.

1098
00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Come on.
-[Prue] Wobble.

1099
00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at that.

1100
00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul grunts]

1101
00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

1102
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The setting of this is spot on.

1103
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You managed to get
each of the layers there

1104
00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
without too much rubber in each layer,
so they've held together just about.

1105
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavours are spot on.

1106
00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And I think the compote
is beautiful.

1107
00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Great flavours, great textures,
overall look. Shame it's split, but--

1108
00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Needed a ribbon.
-You've done a great job.

1109
00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Lovely, thank you.

1110
00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dana, you've certainly got something
of a showstopper just in the box.

1111
00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Looks amazing.

1112
00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flowers are beautifully done,
but the main thing is the dessert.

1113
00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Let's have a quick look
inside this.

1114
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] Oh, wow.
-[Prue] Wow, look at those.

1115
00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Pretty stark colours, them.

1116
00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm not sure I'm getting the floral.
-Okay.

1117
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Not getting the rose.

1118
00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A bit of hibiscus.
-[Paul] Mmm.

1119
00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The raspberry comes through
more than the hibiscus.

1120
00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1121
00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sponge has dried out,
like it's been there for three days.

1122
00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because you put that
in the fridge for so long.

1123
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Cake is pretty solid
and the layers are too thick.

1124
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overall, your appearance is exceptional.
But is it style above substance?

1125
00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1126
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Be honest, I… It was all going well,
everything was set…

1127
00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stop.
-Okay.

1128
00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's effective. I like the colour.
These are quite nice.

1129
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a couple of little splodges.

1130
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've had issues with it.

1131
00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am getting strong strawberry

1132
00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and a decent amount of tang
from the elderflower,

1133
00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is your saving grace
because it makes it floral.

1134
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sponge is all right.
Setting, it's a bit messy, that's all.

1135
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1136
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel sorry for you, because you
were nearly into something perfect.

1137
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I think with your second attempt,

1138
00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
your chocolate ganache
is too much and too thick,

1139
00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the layers
are a bit all over the place.

1140
00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's still very delicious.

1141
00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank God it's over. [laughs]

1142
00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I've seen people
throw stuff in the bin before.

1143
00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:32.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was determined
I wasn't gonna be one of 'em.

1144
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Cristy laughs]

1145
00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm relieved.

1146
00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll take that any day over what
could've been an absolute nightmare.

1147
00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dana] I do think
I'm in the bottom side of things.

1148
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But even if some of the inside fillings
weren't the best,

1149
00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm beyond proud of it.

1150
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] I fell right at the last hurdle
in terms of making it look

1151
00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
like the showstopper it was meant to be.

1152
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They couldn't taste anything.

1153
00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at my face for the last time,
I'm going home tonight.

1154
00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[quacking]

1155
00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, Prue and Paul, Botanicals Week.
How do you think it went?

1156
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Surprisingly well.
-It's actually been quite successful.

1157
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bakes have all been pretty good.

1158
00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When it comes to judging,
comes down to little things.

1159
00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who were the standout people for you?

1160
00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Josh. The textures were right,
the flavours were terrific.

1161
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The whole thing was quite imaginative,

1162
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-beautifully executed.
-Hmm.

1163
00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I was blown away by Tasha's.

1164
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tasha started well this week actually.

1165
00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She didn't do too well
in the technical, she was 7th.

1166
00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But she has bounced back in a big way.

1167
00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, it puts her in line for Star Baker.

1168
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then you look at Cristy,
she had a bit of a mess up with this,

1169
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it did taste good and it looked good.

1170
00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She carried on. I love that.
-[Paul] Never gave up.

1171
00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think three people struggled.

1172
00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Matty struggled.

1173
00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It wasn't quite polished enough
and finished and a bit simple.

1174
00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But then you look at Dana.
The box was okay.

1175
00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I thought it was amazing.
-It was a showstopper,

1176
00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but the dessert had to be perfect.
-What it was all about.

1177
00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] The cake was too thick, a bit dry.
-[Alison] Yeah.

1178
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then Saku.

1179
00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Hardly any flavour.
-Such a shame.

1180
00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But that's not like her either,
which is strange.

1181
00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's gonna be tight
whoever we choose to go home today.

1182
00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's only one today though, isn't it?
-Yeah, only one today.

1183
00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul wants to send three people home.

1184
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1185
00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well done, bakers,
you did fantastic in Botanicals Week.

1186
00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got the great job this week
of announcing Star Baker.

1187
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And this week's Star Baker is…

1188
00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Josh.

1189
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all applauding]

1190
00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Cristy chuckles]

1191
00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And unfortunately,
I've got the job that no one wants.

1192
00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've gotta say this has been

1193
00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
one of the hardest decisions
of the competition so far.

1194
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, the baker leaving the tent today is…

1195
00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dana.

1196
00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dana exhales]

1197
00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

1198
00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, thank you.

1199
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Sorry, Dana. Wasn't your week.
-No, it's okay.

1200
00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Feel I've smashed it, week six.

1201
00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Dan] You've been amazing.
-Thanks.

1202
00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we'll miss you so much.

1203
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just thinking of all the fun
I've had throughout the six weeks.

1204
00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what I'm gonna remember.

1205
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well done. Oh, my God, Josh. Well done.
You so deserve that.

1206
00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overwhelmed. I don't know what to say.
It's incredible.

1207
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, can't wait to tell my mum.

1208
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] You deserved that.

1209
00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've been knocking on the door,
brother, for ages. Well done.

1210
00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Got news to share with you.
-[Josh's mum on mobile] <i>Yeah?</i>

1211
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm Star Baker for this week.

1212
00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Josh's mum screams] <i>Yes! Star Baker!</i>
-[laughs]

1213
00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, thank you so much. [chuckles]

1214
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Through, yeah.

1215
00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Probably a little bit
by the skin of the teeth, but through.

1216
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, my beautiful girl. Hmm.

1217
00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Phew.

1218
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know now, how I am going to ask
annual leave from my manager.

1219
00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's my worry. [laughs]

1220
00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tomorrow morning, email.
"Charlotte, I want more time off."

1221
00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Charlotte will climb walls. [laughing]
