202
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Three?

203
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Imagine if Crystelle
won three Star Bakers. [chuckles]

204
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

205
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They look okay.
The biscuits are looking good.

206
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

207
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Got a bit of colour round the edge,
which I'm happy with.

208
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I forgot to sprinkle
sesame seeds on the top of these,

209
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

because these can go on the bottom.

210
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's some funky smells
coming from over here.

211
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's the dark cocoa.

212
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] What percentage is that?
-It's black. 100%.

213
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

214
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God. It's giving me a stitch.

215

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

218
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I was gonna say Jaguar wee.

219
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

220
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow, you're weirder than me.
It's official. Jaguar wee. [laughs]

221
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] Still doesn't
look like a meringue.

222
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll give it a bit more.

223
00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But now the machine's blinking,
so the ice cream is essentially done.

224
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At least I can start
shaping my sandwiches.

225
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>The ice cream needs to be set</i>

226

227
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lizzie] Oh, my God, that's so cold.

228
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I use silicon moulds,
but the silicon moulds are a bit small,

229
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so this is going to be
slightly interesting.

230
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] So, I realise in practice
that my moulds are very thick,

231
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I'm only gonna fill them halfway.

232
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the best way to do that
is to use a piping bag.

233
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was gonna go for a rustic look.

235
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>…Giuseppe has decided</i>

236
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The ice cream is starting
to lose consistency,

237
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'm going to have to be very quick.
Otherwise, I will lose this.

238
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I'll go for it now, I think.

245
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In the practice, I didn't whisk
the Italian meringue long enough.

246
00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was too impatient.

247
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This has this nice, rough structure
that this mix should have.

248
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] I'm drizzling
my top biscuits with, uh,

249
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I didn't dry them out in the practice

254
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

255
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

time to cool down, doesn't it? [chuckles]

261
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

This one's tough, 'cause Paul's not

264
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the whole shape better.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

There is an element of, erm,
[chuckling] church decor in there.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, there's always another Technical

They're a little uneven. Rather huge.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've lost
a bit of the definition in the cuts.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because they've disappeared.

322
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, I love the texture.

323
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very dry and very crumbly.

324
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't think I was going to like it.
[snickers] I do.

325
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is a chocolatey hint to it,
which is slightly bitter,

326
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which marries it beautifully
with the ice cream.

327
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got a nice vanilla kick in it,
but you've got that praline as well.

328
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would've blitzed that really small
and folded that through

329
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so you'd have ended up
with a bit more praline in your mouth.

330
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What you do get is very good,
it's just messy.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

337
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Really beautiful.

338
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

339
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Look at that. Neat as a pin.

340
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The mango. Needs lots more.
-[Chigs] Mmm-hmm?

341
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think canned mango pulp
would have been better.

342
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not a lot of flavour
coming from the biscuit.

343
00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Chigs] Okay.
-Erm…

344
00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great texture, though.

345
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The ice cream,
you do get the mango very subtly.

346
00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You do get that coconut as well.

347
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's not going to last long,
it is very sorbet-like.

348
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, over all, it is nice. The ice cream
just needs more of a punch.

349
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Thank you, guys.

350
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you rest them before you baked them?

351
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't, because the Italian meringue
took so long to cool down.

352
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The whole thing about a macaron
is the resting that creates the skin

353
00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which creates the dome,
which you do not have.

354
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Therefore, you end up with that.
-Yes.

355
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But you might have invented
something which is very suitable.

356
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is very chewy.

357
00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like it.

358
00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Chewy and almondy.
-[Jürgen] Mmm-hmm.

359
00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The nuts, you do get beautifully,
but the ice cream's the star here.

360
00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-It's fantastic.

361
00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Intense flavour of bananas.
-[Prue] Mmm-hmm.

362
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Hmm.

363
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Well done.

365
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Delicious.

366
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a nice-looking, very uniform set.

367
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I absolutely agree.
It looks tempting and I want one.

368
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle chuckles] Good.

369
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the flavour is absolutely lovely.

370
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The texture of the ice cream
is a bit light and wet.

371
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That--
-I actually really like it. Yeah.

372
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never had anything like that before.

373
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, the tahini in the biscuit
is akin to a sort of shortbread.

374
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the sesame comes through quite nicely.

375
00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Coffee levels
are perfect in the ice cream.

376
00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is very flavoursome
and it holds on the tongue as well

377
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which blends quite well.

378
00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you've done a good job.

379
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you've done a really nice job.

380
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done, Crystelle.
-[Paul] Hmm. Thank you.

381
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think they look lovely.
Very interesting. It's almost got a--

383
00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Looks like a craquelin. Yeah.

384
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've managed
pretty consistent shapes.

385
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look.

386
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You said this is made with tofu?

387
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, this is made with tofu and soymilk.

388
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's definitely not
as creamy as I thought it would be.

389
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the flavour is lovely.

390
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, texture's fantastic.

391
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a very short crispy biscuit, which,
just on its own, would be delicious.

392
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the ice cream is great.

393
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The orange comes through, cooked through.
You do get a hit of the ginger as well.

394
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Oh,
the whole thing is just delicious.

395
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've done a great job with that.

396
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would love that just bashed up
in a bowl with a spoon and eat the lot.

397
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's lovely.

398
00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Very clever.
-Thank you.

399
00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't have any
past experience in free-from,

400
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so, this is probably
the most pleased I've ever been.

401
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lizzie] What's new?

402
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's too big, don't look neat,
but they liked the flavours.

403
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was very nervous about my macarons.

404
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But Prue liked my… [chuckles] "invention."

405
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] I think the others got amazing
feedback on their flavours,

406
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I didn't, so I need to
come out swinging in the Technical.

You lucky things,
it's time for your Technical,

410
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which today has been set by the Prue.

411
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The Prue, any words of advice?
-Yes.

412
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flavour always matters,
but in this recipe it's absolutely key.

413
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thank you. Well, as ever,
this task is judged blind,

414
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so we ask the judges to leave the tent.

415
00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Where do you think they've gone?

416
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To the dogs, mate,
like the rest of this country.

417
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got to the point you can't even
put meat in a vegan recipe.

418
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Honestly, you couldn't make it up.

419
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For your Technical Challenge,
Prue would love you to make

420
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
eight identical vegan sausage rolls.

421
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Your sausage rolls should comprise

422
00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of crisp, golden, vegan rough puff pastry,

423
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
surrounding a mushroom and walnut filling.

424
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They should be accompanied by a sticky,
caramelised red onion chutney.

425
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] You have two hours.

426
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks.
-Get set.

427
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Bake.
-[Crystelle] Oh, for God's sake.

428
00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lizzie] I've made vegan sausage rolls
but not with mushrooms and walnuts.

429
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who doesn't like a sausage roll?

430
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Haven't made sausage rolls before.
I haven't made vegan rough puff pastry.

431
00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is going to be really interesting.

432
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And interesting in every bad
sense of the word.

433
00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, Prue, tell us all about
your vegan sausage rolls.

434
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're looking for eight
perfectly identical vegan sausage rolls

435
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with really well laminated, crisp
rough puff pastry.

436
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What fat do you put in the pastry?
Because you can't use butter.

437
00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it's a vegan block.

438
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got almond, coconut and rapeseed oil

439
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then you treat it just like butter
when you're making rough puff.

440
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm really quite impressed because it
has made really nice little laminations.

441
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] They'll struggle with this,

442
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with the vegan block,
which tends to melt very quickly.

443
00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they chill it enough,
they'll be all right.

444
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You just have to keep chilling it.

445
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm! Together with the chutney,
it's delicious.

446
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pastry is beautifully light.

447
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's really flaky.
You wouldn't know it was vegan pastry.

448
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it's the quarter finals.

449
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I think this is
a very challenging Challenge.

450
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's certainly more difficult than
a straightforward sausage roll.

451
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, "Number one:
Make the dough for the rough puff."

452
00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh, we got flour, vegan block,
salt and water.

453
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never used vegan block before.

454
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got a very odd appearance.

455
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's going to be interesting
to see what it looks like.

456
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm worried about the puff pastry because
I can't remember the last time I made it.

457
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm looking for
the whole thing to bind together.

458
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There you go.

459
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you see now it's clumping up.
I don't want to overhydrate the flour

460
00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause it'll become too sticky
to work with.

461
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] The dough needs to be firm

462
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but a little bit pliable.

463
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like maybe I didn't put
enough water in my pastry.

464
00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just gonna go with it
and hope that it works.

465
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Number two: Laminate the dough
using the frozen vegan block."

466
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] It looks like tofu, it's weird.

467
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lizzie] It laminates,
so once you roll it out,

468
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it creates layers, and then,
in the oven, the butter melts

469
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and creates steam
which puffs the pastry up.

470
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you like laminating?

471
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I like makin' a puff pastry. Yeah.
-Do ya?

472
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is actually--
-That's why you're making me one?

473
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckling] Yeah.

474
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Complete four single turns."

475
00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[groaning] I have no idea what that means.

476
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] I'm gonna go
for a normal book fold.

477
00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A third of it over, another third over
and turn it. Gotta do that four times.

478
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know if it'll be the way they
want it to be, but it'll be laminated.

479
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] That's fold number two.

480
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is mine disgusting?

481
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lizzie] Close the sides in
so nothing comes out.

482
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this for the puff business?

483
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is for the puff business
and this is a bad thing here.

484
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Butter come through?

485
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Jürgen] The butter leaked out.
-[Noel] Oh, no.

486
00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What could that mean?
-Bad lamination.

487
00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Bad lamination.

488
00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What could that mean?

489
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We want loose laminations.
-Eh, Star Baker?

490
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What could that mean?

491
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckling] "Cross Paul." Paul be cross.

492
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And now I'm going
to wrap this and chill it.

493
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] It needs to be
resting in between folding.

494
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm gonna be putting this
in the fridge for another ten minutes.

495
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] Let the butter solidify again.

496
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If the butter melts,
it'll ooze out in the oven.

497
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wanna keep it chilled
so it stays in the pastry.

498
00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lizzie] What am I doing?

499
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Finely chop the mushrooms and walnuts,
fry the onions."

500
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs heavily]

501
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like a veggie sausage roll,
but I don't normally make the middle bit.

502
00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I get the veggie sausages
and smush them with a fork

503
00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and throw them in some puff pastry.

504
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Easier, isn't it, than all this faffing?
-Something savoury for a change.

505
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, exactly.
-[Noel] Paul loves savoury.

506
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He won't be able to resist getting his
sausage roll fingers onto sausage rolls.

507
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[both chuckling]
-Onto the sausage rolls.

508
00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's how he measure out the sizes.
-[laughs]

509
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He puts his index finger down.

510
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe] I do a lot of cooking at home.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I usually do this at least once a week

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause my son Georgio's favourite pizza
is mushroom pizza.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] Once I've got that in the pan,
I'll go back to my pastry.

514
00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I might be doing double turns.

516
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm very confused with lamination.

517
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] That's it.

518
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Turns done.

519
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will save this now until later.

520
00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you are halfway through.

521
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What was that?
-That was free from comedy.

522
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're good at that.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Crystelle] Miso! Hello, old friend.

529
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I guess this is what
gives it the meaty flavour

531
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that you miss from actual meat.

532
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Parsley, sage and thyme.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do they do sausage rolls much in Italy?

534
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, yes! They call them differently.
They're called rustici.

535
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

538
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everybody make your rustici!

542
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I'm happy with that.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's get this pastry out and rolled out.

546
00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have to carve eight rectangles
10 centimetres by 15 out of this.

547
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it needs to be relatively thin.

548
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

549
00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Crystelle] I've got off-cuts.

552
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Chigs] I'm gonna start
makin' the sausage rolls now.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was gonna measure this out,
but I don't have time.

560
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

this is shoddy, isn't it?

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and place them behind your photograph.

[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue are looking for</i>

620

621
00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

623
00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bit of a mixed bag, isn't it?
-[Paul] Let's start with this one?

624
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There should be a better glaze on the top.

625
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I'm happy with the colour.
It's very thin.

626
00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But they've sealed the edges
as well as the front.

627
00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The flavour is okay. Good balance.
-[Prue] Mmm.

628
00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, the um,
onion chutney is good as well.

629
00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the mixture inside because
it's crumbly and soft. Lovely!

630
00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay, moving on to these pasties.

631
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue chuckles] I mean,
they're meant to look like sausage rolls.

632
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's a bit rough and ready.

633
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavour's not bad, actually.
Did get a mouthful of nuts.

634
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The onion chutney looks good.

635
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the vegan
shortening has run out of it.

636
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it's rather tough.

637
00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know, there's a lot of
chilli in that. [chuckles]

638
00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

639
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] My nose is running
'cause of the chilli.

640
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow! Milk, please!

641
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can have some oat milk.

642
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Happy with the chilli.
-[both laugh]

644
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That's a lot of chilli. Right.

645
00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This one is a lot better looking.

646
00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think these are flat,
but they all look pretty much the same.

647
00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Problem is the seals are so big.

648
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good mushroom flavour.

649
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Mmm! Mushroom flavour is there.

650
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think they're a bit overbaked.

651
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] A bit dry.
-[Prue] Mmm.

652
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Moving on,
this one is definitely overbaked.

653
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] But the lamination is quite good.
-[Paul] Yeah, the lamination you can see.

654
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's definitely overbaked,
but the flakiness is excellent.

655
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's dried out the interior, so it's drawn
the moisture out from the mushroom.

656
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On to the last one.

657
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] They're a bit big and clumsy.
-[Paul] They are.

658
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] The colour looks nice.
-[Prue] Mmm.

659
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] It's a bit dry.
-[Prue] I like the flavour.

660
00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] It is okay.
-[Prue] It is herby, but I like it.

661
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay.

662

679
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all over the place.
It's too thick and untidy.

680
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

685
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're just too flat
and you've used too much seam.

686
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It needs to be bolder and a thinner seam.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

705
00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

706
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, for me, at the front is,
of course, Giuseppe.

709
00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

710
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, the likes of Chigs, who did well
in the Technical, could catch up.

711
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

they're all going to be on him.

Giuseppe taking his eye off the ball.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Both Lizzie and Crystelle,

A sponge traditionally uses plain flour.
They haven't got that option,

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

"What flour am I going to use?"

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a natural product.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

and it's not runny,
which I'm really cool about.

925
00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So these are amarena, black sour cherries.
They're very flavoursome and powerful,

926
00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so if you put too many,

927
00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you might end up pushing
the balance of flavour a bit too far.

928
00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] Cake number two.

929
00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] This is whiskey and apricot.

930
00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at you go!

931
00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoops. Sorry.

932
00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, it's all right.
I'm-- It's very refreshing.

933
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not the worst thing
to be sploshed on.

934
00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. No, I can definitely
think of worse things.

935
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

936
00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] Right.
I need to decorate the hell out of it,

937
00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is going to take me about ten years.

938
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] It's going to be all covered up
in mirror glaze.

939
00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lizzie] I want to see loads of colour.

940
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then, like, very textured.

941
00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love a good rose.

942
00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] This is going to be
a messy exercise.

943
00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles] It is very satisfying,
isn't it?

944
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] So, this is the ganache
for the chocolate drips

945
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
on the bottom layer.

946
00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lizzie] It's all the things
going on in me brain.

947
00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Some people think, ADHD,

948
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you gotta be crazy,
you know, loads of energy,

949
00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's like you've got
too many thoughts in your head

950
00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you don't actually know
what to think about.

951
00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's all about colour
and, you know, like brain fuzz.

952
00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Looks like a tricky stage.

953
00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Better for my presence.

954
00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely.

955
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You might not believe it,
but you are a calming influence.

956
00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's never been said before.

957
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lizzie] Oh, that's a bit wonky, isn't it?

958
00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And this is the second tier.
-Oh, it's the second-- Wow.

959
00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How big is your cake?

960
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's big.
-[Noel] Big.

961
00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can get inside it?

962
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ah, not quite.
-[Noel] You're gonna ride it in?

963
00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I'm not gonna talk now,

964
00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause I don't wanna get blamed
for that when that goes… [laughing]

965
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is stressful territory,
but I'm just gonna… Oops.

966
00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
…go on as quick as I can.

967
00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

968
00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel like I need to hurry up a bit.

969
00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. I'm feeling so nervous.

970
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's wrong with me? Stop it.

971
00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pipe faster.

972
00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] Right.
So, that's the bodice.

973
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] This chocolate is for the colour.

974
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That will get wrapped
around the top layer of the cake.

975
00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to tidy up the edges
with lots of Chantilly cream.

976
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] You understand
why you see me move very fast?

977
00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah? I'm on track.

978
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] My grandma,

979
00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
she hasn't had
many opportunities to wear a nice dress.

980
00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I think this will be almost like
the dress that she never got to wear.

981
00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lizzie] Do you think
this counts as finesse?

982
00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] So, I need the ganache
to run down the sides of the cake.

983
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] Nerve-wracking bit now.

984
00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] Shall I just move it
from A to B? I'm gonna have to.

985
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a breeze. I'll wait for it to go

986
00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it's gonna
knock over my cake, I can just feel it.

987
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] How much time left?

988
00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have one minute left.

989
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] Oh, come on.

990
00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I've gotta peel this off now.
-[Crystelle] The breeze is still there.

991
00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unfortunately, I can't move
until that breeze has gone.

992
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gotta put
the decorating strawberries on top.

993
00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Finished in a hurry, huh?

994
00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are staying very still.

995
00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up.

996
00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Done. Drop mic.

997
00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please step away from your bakes.

998
00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

999
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like I've done
a gymnastics routine.

1000
00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] It looks unbelievable.
Look how neat that is.

1001
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's supposed to be my grandma's dress.

1002
00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What! Your grandma's
got a dress like that?

1003
00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, not that… [laughing]
-Go on, Gran.

1004
00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, everybody.

1005
00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lizzie] Who thought I could decorate
a cake like that? [laughs]

1006
00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
God, I'm getting emotional.
I'm so bloody proud of you.

1007
00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Lizzie] Don't start crying, I'll cry.
-[Crystelle] I'm not gonna cry.

1008
00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Chigs] Oh, bless you.

1024
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the whole coating and the icing
go beautifully with the sponge.

1025
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

on the buttercream.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] But you need that
against the cardamom.

1028
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] If you get
a mouthful like that… [chuckles]

1029
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I don't know, I like that.

1030
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[all laughing]
-You'd be perfectly happy with it.

1031
00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think you've done a great job.

1032
00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Well done. Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

1033
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very neat. Very beautiful.

1034
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispering] I don't know.

1035
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the top, it's just
a little bit awkward for me.

1036
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It hides a lot when you pipe like this.

1037
00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, okay.

1038
00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My cake is inspired to the flavours
of the Black Forest,

1039
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that is, cherry, chocolate and, uh, cream.

1040
00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's actually a bit gluey.

1041
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kirsch and the cherries are very strong.

1042
00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The cherries are pretty sporadic.

1043
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sponge is quite stodgy.

1044
00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is this a Chantilly?
-[Giuseppe] Yes.

1045
00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would have done an Italian meringue.
That would've worked beautifully well.

1046
00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Underwhelmed.

1047
00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Mmm.
-Mmm.

1048
00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I expected better from you.

1049
00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do think it looks great.

1050
00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-You got good drops

1051
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
on your naked cake down at the bottom.

1052
00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The colour's worked.
It's a nice job. It looks like a crown.

1053
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a lot of detail in it.
It's really impressive, isn't it?

1054
00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Let's see if we can chop
into this bad boy, shall we?

1055
00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The layers are lovely and distinct.

1056
00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I love it.
-[chuckles]

1057
00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's spot-on.
It's a great chocolate sponge.

1058
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And, actually, you've got
a lot of buttercream in there.

1059
00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Mmm.
-But it works.

1060
00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cream-cheese frosting again,
that's, like, cooling on the tongue.

1061
00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a nice cake.

1062
00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't fault it. I think it's lovely.

1063
00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Great job, Chigs.

1064
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much.
-Well done.

1065
00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who knew right at the beginning

1066
00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that you could produce that
in the quarter finals?

1067
00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know. Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.

1068
00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would have never known
that was a chocolate cake.

1069
00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue laughs]

1070
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it looks absolutely beautiful.

1071
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The whole effect
with the drips you've got

1072
00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
are all perfect and so is the piping.

1073
00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Oh, that looks so beautiful.
-[Noel] Wow!

1074
00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That apricot with the chocolate sponges

1075
00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is beautiful. It's really nicely baked.

1076
00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's not dry at all.
-[Jürgen] Mmm-Hmm.

1077
00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I also think the buttercream
is beautifully light.

1078
00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much.
-[Paul] Well done.

1079
00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Well done.
-[Noel] Well done, Jürgs.

1080
00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Matches his T-shirt.
-[Prue] Yeah. [chuckling]

1081
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughing]
-[Prue] Ombre T-shirt.

1082
00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs, whispering]
Well done. Really good.

1083
00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is my celebration of being different.

1084
00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, that is just amazing.

1085
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the rice paper offshoots
are just so beautifully done.

1086
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at the tiny little
letters and numbers.

1087
00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love it. It reminds me of something
from the cartoon <i>The Yellow Submarine.</i>

1088
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never seen a cake like it.
I don't think any of us have.

1089
00:50:54.720 --> 00:51:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, it's a lime Swiss meringue
and a coconut cake with pineapple jam.

1090
00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You really need to eat
the buttercream with it

1091
00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the pineapple is very strong
and there's a lot of it.

1092
00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do get a hint of the lime.
And you need that in there.

1093
00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got the coconut
in the sponge as well,

1094
00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which you can taste.

1095
00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Yes, the coconut's good.
-And you've got the pineapple.

1096
00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd have that on my 40th any day.

1097
00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When it eventually comes round.

1098
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughing]
-[Lizzie] Okay. [chuckles]

1099
00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] I think it's wonderful.
-We asked for exquisite and finesse.

1100
00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:29.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we got it.

1101
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew you could do it.

1102
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Ta.

1103
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Well done.

1104
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just fantastic.

1105
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[mouthing] Oh, my God!
-[mouthing] I know.

1106
00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God. Finesse!

1107
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got finesse.

1108
00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've won <i>Bake Off</i> in my mind.

1109
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] I don't know how I'm doing this.

1110
00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul's comment was
that he couldn't fault it.

1111
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, really overwhelming.

1112
00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Happy, really happy.

1113
00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mine was a bit of a disaster. [chuckles]

1114
00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I think that puts me,</i>
<i>you know, in an awkward position,</i>

1115
00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>despite having done quite well yesterday.</i>

1116
00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not sure what to expect, to be honest.

1117
00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] I'm very happy that went well,
but I don't feel safe at all.

1118
00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll cross my fingers, my toes,
say a prayer.

1119
00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And, hopefully, my grandma,
who I dedicated my cake to,

1120
00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is saying a prayer for me, too.

1121
00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. The world has turned upside down.

1122
00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Four extraordinary Showstoppers
and Giuseppe didn't really impress you.

1123
00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The middle was no good at all.
-[Paul] It was stodgy.

1124
00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think, ultimately,
Giuseppe was in a strong position anyway.

1125
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Giuseppe had done enough prior
to these two challenges to save himself.

1126
00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah. I think Giuseppe's safe.
-What about Jürgen?

1127
00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Those layers of the white,
milk and dark chocolate.

1128
00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Clever.
-And they were beautifully done.

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It was a delicious cake.
-So he's gotta be in line for Star Baker.

1130
00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Absolutely. And I think Jürgen stepped up,
but he's not the only one.

1131
00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Chigs. The cream cheese frosting,
the buttercream,

1132
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the sponge itself.

1133
00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Beautiful.
-[Prue] This was a faultless cake.

1134
00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, let's talk about Lizzie's.

1135
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She made a cake and a pet
at the same time.

1136
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The time she spent, you know,
creating that bear rug,

1137
00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we all knew she could come up
with something with finesse.

1138
00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think she's done it.
-It's a complete triumph.

1139
00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, Crystelle came into today in trouble.

1140
00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did she do enough with her Showstopper?

1141
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Problem is,
everybody else has done the same.

1142
00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They've all done really well.

1143
00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Crystelle and Lizzie
are absolutely neck and neck.

1144
00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've got to look at it,
generally, as bakers,

1145
00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which one deserves their place
in the semi final?

1146
00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, bakers, you have made the judges'
lives quite difficult this week

1147
00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because all five of you
are terrific bakers

1148
00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and all five of you have had moments
of real excellence in the tent this week.

1149
00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we do have to separate you.

1150
00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'm lucky in that
I have the job of telling you

1151
00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which one of you
is going to be Star Baker.

1152
00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm delighted to say
that Star Baker this week is…

1153
00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chigs.

1154
00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-[Crystelle] Well done!

1155
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got the horrible job of announcing
the person who's going home.

1156
00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And, as Matt said, it was so close.

1157
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've all been so fantastic.

1158
00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The person who's leaving us is…

1159
00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lizzie.

1160
00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[voice breaking] No. No. No. No.
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1161
00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle sobbing]

1162
00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both sobbing]

1163
00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel really proud of myself.
I'm really happy. Oh, God. [chuckles]

1164
00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was so overwhelmed to even get here
and now I'm, like, a quarter finalist.

1165
00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And now I'm dead Scouse 'cause I'm crying.

1166
00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Crystelle] Bloody Technical Challenges.
-You were so good.

1167
00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks. Oh, God. [chuckles]

1168
00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lizzie] It's such an amazing experience,

1169
00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
oh, to, like, meet the people
that I've met and, like,

1170
00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
learn everything.

1171
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

1172
00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] You did really well.

1173
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's really sad to see Lizzie go,
someone from my neck of the woods.

1174
00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's been a bit up and down
over the weeks,

1175
00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but, actually, this week,
she did really well.

1176
00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The problem was she came up with an ace
when everybody else did as well.

1177
00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am proud of myself.
It's, like, happy tears.

1178
00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't wait to go and walk my dog,
to be honest.

1179
00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1180
00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] I can't believe
I got a Star Baker.

1181
00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Getting one was brilliant,
but getting two? Wow!

1182
00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It feels good

1183
00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I just get more
and more confident week on week.

I don't think
it's going to sink in for a while.
