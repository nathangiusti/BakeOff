00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

they have to prove it for a bit longer

55
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it's full of butter,
so it will rise more slowly.

the dough will be very tight inside.

it's not easy to mix it in

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

211
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so that they cook evenly in the oven.

212
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it tends to catch in the oven,

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-[Paul] Good fruit distribution in there.

I think you have slightly over-baked them.

304
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I get the blueberry.
I get the cinnamon.

309
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Great texture.
The proving is perfect.

310
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And the baking is perfect.
It's got good flavour.

311
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That tastes fantastic.

312
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You just needed that temperature
to be up by 20 degrees,

313
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you'd have ended up
with the perfect teacake.

314

315
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Handshake from me. Means nothing.

316

317
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These two look heavily fruited
and these don't.

318
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They might not be when you open them,
but the truth is, it's better not to have

319
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
these outside, because they get
a bit too over-cooked.

320
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My problem is, I don't think it's baked.

321
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Oh, no. No, that's not good.
-It's not baked.

322
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

323
00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You got any salt in there?

324
00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, a little bit of salt.
-Not enough. It's bland.

325
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know, I think you could've done
with a bit more fruit in here.

326
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What temperature was your oven?

327
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-160.
-Too low.

328
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Smells great.

329
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I actually quite like them.
-Yeah?

330
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I do.
The thing it needs, though, is more spice.

331
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, really? Okay.

332
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It just lacks flavour.
But actually, the fruit is lovely.

333
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's clever of you to have rolled
them so that the fruit is really encased.

334
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never got any fruit in that one.

335
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Never got any fruit in that one.
-[laughing]

336
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the flavour of the dough is excellent
and that balances it out,

337
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so by the time you toast it
and put your butter on,

338
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it tastes good. That's the closest thing
I've had to a teacake so far.

339
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think you've baked it okay.

340
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

341
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I honestly think it's a good teacake.
It looks like a teacake,

342
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it feels like a teacake. It's not hard.

343
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think your choice of milk
was a big problem,

344
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because if you'd had egg on that,
they'd look as they should,

345
00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you got the basic shape.
You have got a decent teacake.

346
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There seems to be
plenty of fruit in there.

347
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm certainly getting the fruit
and I'm certainly getting the orange.

348
00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Spices? Yeah, I'm getting that, too.
Overall, I think the flavour's good,

349
00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
distribution's good, the size is okay.
Just slightly under-proved.

350
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Okay.

351
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a little doughy, isn't it?

352
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the volume of fruit,
and it's added all that moisture to it.

353
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But overall, the flavour is nice,
you know?

354
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It does have a very good flavour.
What else is in the mango?

355
00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cardamom. Cumin. Chili.

356
00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's amazing. There are so many things
going on. Beautiful chutney.

357
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Yan] Little bit of a kick at the end.
I didn't want to blow your heads off.

358
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great.

359
00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very, very good.
-Thank you.

360
00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Really delicious.

361
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They, my friend, are not your finest hour.
They are pretty bad.

362
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just over-proved.

363
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've heated it up
and the whole thing has fallen apart.

364
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] On the other hand,

365
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
your vodka cocktail

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Try a bit of vodka butter, Paul,
see if you change your mind.

368
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

370
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I got my negative feedback
that I'd been waiting for.

371
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think he referred to it as not my
finest hour. It was really disappointing.

372
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By far my worst bake in the tent,
hands down.

373
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need to come, like, top three
in the Technical or I'm in trouble.

374
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do feel relived. Yeah, definitely.
Just looking forward to the Technical now.

375
00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I think for someone who has never
really eaten a teacake,

376
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
for Paul to say it was the closest thing
to a teacake he'd had so far was...

377
00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was pretty good.

378
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would very much like them to say,
"Wow, you've nailed it."

379
00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just so pleased I know what it is.

406
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I kind of know what I'm doing.

407
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>But not all our bakers</i>
<i>have this loaf in their repertoire.</i>

408
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] I've not made one before.

409
00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very daunting. I don't bake a lot
of bread, what can go wrong?

410
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Apart from everything. Ha!

411
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why have you set a cottage loaf
for a challenge?

412
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are the best amateur bakers
Great Britain has to offer,

413
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I expect them to be able to make
a decent cottage loaf.

414
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What I want to see is a smaller piece
of dough on the top, but not too small.

415
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Larger on the bottom,

416
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
good, even colour,
and good slashes all the way around.

417
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] What can go wrong, Paul?

418
00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shaping obviously is the key point,

419
00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because you've got to be able to bond
the top with the bottom.

420
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they don't,
the bottom will blow off the top,

421
00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so the top will literally fall off.

422
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's all about making
both the balls quite tight,

423
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the way that you'd do that and the way
I'd do it is just drive my finger

424
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
right the way through
to the tray underneath.

425
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you flour your finger?

426
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You must. Otherwise,
it will just stick to the dough.

427
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I could oil it.

428
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Make a dough."
That's it, that's all we get.

429
00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] The instructions are pretty vague,

430
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so just trying to get as much liquid
into it as possible

431
00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
without it becoming sloppy.

432
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never made one before in my life,

433
00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I've gone for the rubbing in the lard,
don't know if that's right.

434
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna make the basic dough,
flour, salt, yeast, water.

435
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you put too much water in it, it goes
drunk. What I've experienced loads.

436
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

437
00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I've made it once before,
little one on top, lid, off.

438
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, I've got a lot to make up for
from this morning.

439
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Making the dough by hand.

440
00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God. It's quite a long process.

441
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My muscles aching so bad.
They're knackered.

442
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[James] If it's not kneaded enough,
it just loses all its shape.

443
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't know if that's right or not, but...

444
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It feels like it should feel, I guess?

445
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't really afford
to leave it much longer.

446
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all about time management.

447
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] I'm just about to do
the windowpane test.

448
00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it doesn't get a hole in it, that means
the gluten has developed enough.

449
00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can stretch it
and see it's almost ready.

450
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thirty more seconds for luck.

451
00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's going in to its first prove.

452
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love Paul's instructions, don't you?
Prove. Do it. He hasn't given us any info.

453
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prove it for forty minutes.

454
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're gonna do it for about an hour.
Play it by ear.

455
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Forty-five and check it.

456
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If the dough doesn't prove enough,
the loaf won't come up and rise.

457
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What I want is double in size.

458
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dough's in the proving drawer,
so we just wait.

459
00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel, like, heart racy.

460
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is horrible.

461
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you enjoying bread week?
-So far, so good.

462
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] You like bread, don't you?

463
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love bread. But I do know what
a cottage loaf is. I have made one before.

464
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's an advantage.

465
00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You said that like you didn't.

466
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stacey] No, I have made one before.

467
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I do know what it is.
-I do know... [laughs]

468
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have seen one. I have made one.

469
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I have made one before.
-Yeah? Prove it.

470
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're gonna moonwalk out of here.
Good luck.

471
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[timer beeping]

472
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm taking it out. Whee!

473
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[James] It's the art of actually knowing

474
00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when it feels right,
whether it's proved right.

475
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just haven't got the experience.

476
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you take that out now?
What do you reckon?

477
00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna leave it with you, my love.

478
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm quite happy with it.
-Looks good. Risen well.

479
00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The instructions say, "Divide the dough
and shape into two balls,

480
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
one small and one large."

481
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[groans] How much I'm gonna split it?
I'm gonna split it

482
00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
500/225, or am I gonna split it...
I just don't know yet.

483
00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take about a third, I think.

484
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A quarter?

485
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Divide by three.

486
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] I'm not weighing it.
I'm just doing it by eye.

487
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No one had scales,
electric scales in a cottage.

488
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[James] "Shape into a classic
cottage loaf."

489
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's about as much instruction
as we got.

490
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I'm just shaping the dough.
Otherwise it will kind of wonk over.

491
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't want wonky balls.

492
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Can't help but look around.

493
00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul wants it perfect
and this isn't looking that perfect.

494
00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe this should have been smaller.

495
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

496
00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That doesn't seem right.

497
00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What Paul does is
he sticks his fingers in the flour

498
00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and he goes down like that.

499
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Two fingers.

500
00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Up and down like that.
I just know how Paul does it.

501
00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That just looks wrong and weird.

502
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Yan] Put your finger in it.

503
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] I'm just gonna stick with it.

504
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Slash the dough anywhere you like,
I guess.

505
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The instructions say prove, so this
is gonna go back into the proving drawer.

506
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tom] The second prove is really important

507
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it's what gives
the final loaf its structure.

Forty-five.

Take it out. The second prove.

513
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not horrific.

514
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] If that's not right,
I don't know what is.

515
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very happy with that.

516
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Julia] Just want to make it perfect.

517
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That looks like BB-8 out of Star Wars.
Oh well.

518
00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not happy.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at my cowpat.
It's turned into just one loaf.

521
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the dough was too wet.
It kind of spread.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hot water in the pan,
creating a bit of steam-age.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

526
00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Baking it at 170,
but I might have to turn it up.

527
00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll probably do, like, ten minutes high
and then drop it down.

528
00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How long are you gonna bake it for?

530
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thirty, 35 minutes,
but I'm gonna watch it like a hawk.

531
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[James] The longer it's in there,
the longer mine's hid.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

535
00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bottom of my bread
has eaten the top of my bread.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not a great sign, is it?

544
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hope the clouds are not a reflection
of Paul's mood. I'll put it that way.

545
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm happy it hasn't gone like that.

546
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just hope it doesn't go "oop."

547
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

548
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-[Kate] It's fallen off the top!

550
00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It just fell off.

551
00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God, it's ruined.

552
00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

554
00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God. I'm dying inside.

555
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know what? It's not the worst.

556
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So that's... It's just all about
not being the worst.

557
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Say something urgent.

559
00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

560
00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seriously? Five minutes?

561
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mine's raw.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've just put the oven back up a little
bit because it's not quite dark enough.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the highest temperature possible
just to get it... bang.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

565
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think it's cooked.
I know it's not cooked.

566
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

My God, it's actually sliding more down.

569
00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll wait until the last minute.

570
00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you've got one minute left!

572
00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's definitely not cooked.

573
00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

574
00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm taking it out at the last 30 seconds.

575
00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gonna be tight.

Okay, bakers, your time's up.
Please bring up your cottage loaves.

578
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a disaster.

[Sandi] <i>Paul and Prue want to see</i>
<i>a classic cottage loaf,</i>

580
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>well risen, with a rounded bottom</i>
<i>and a honey-coloured crusty exterior.</i>

581
00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>They have no idea whose loaf is whose.</i>

582
00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's start from this one over here.

583
00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The actual shape of it,
the way it sits is good.

584
00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a little bit of decoration
on there, which is good.

585
00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And a nice rounded bottom.
It's quite risen.

586
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's proved well,
but it's slightly under-baked.

587
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good flavour.

588
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Overall, not bad at all.

589
00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul, I really do like this one.
It's been properly pushed together.

590
00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is a nice shape.
I do like the big cuts in it as well.

591
00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look at it inside.

592
00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is baked, it's crispy.

593
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] When you're making a big loaf,
you can afford to have some crust,

594
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's worth it because it's lovely.
I think it's a really satisfactory loaf.

595
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay, next one.

596
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] That doesn't look
as if it's risen at all.

597
00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A little bit more proving
might have helped.

598
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit soft. It needed ten, fifteen,
maybe even twenty minutes

599
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
still in the oven.

600
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's coming out too early,
what happens is the dough then rests

601
00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then concertinas down onto the bottom.

602
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right moving onto this.
The actual shape, but it is central.

603
00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It hasn't ripped either way.

604
00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got a little bit of a crisp there.

605
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If that had another ten minutes,
it would be perfectly crisp, wouldn't it?

606
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Okay, next one.
The actual overall proportions are right.

607
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very nice.
-Flavour's good.

608
00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it would be nicer
if it had more crust.

609
00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Right, moving on.

610
00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just not been put on straight.

611
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Normally, you'd push your finger

612
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
right the way through

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and that allows the dough
to become straighter.

614
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Yes, this didn't get
the finger treatment at all.

615
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Next one.
The overall shape is good.

616
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's stayed in the middle.

617
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It's really under-baked.
-[Paul] Yeah, it is.

618
00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you can still feel
it's full of moisture. It's a wet loaf.

619
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Right, moving on to this.
The whole thing has merged together

620
00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to create a big cob, you've lost that top.

621
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The dough itself was a bit too wet.

622
00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn't look like
a cottage loaf at all.

623
00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very neat. I quite like the look
of that one. The proportions are right,

624
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and actually, the height as well.
You see the way it folds in?

625
00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's lost a bit of definition on the top,
but it is still there.

626
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite light, too.

627
00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Enough salt. Flavour's good.

628
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a decent loaf, that one.

629
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, last. The colour's good,

630
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the one on the top is almost like
a pancake sitting on top of a cob.

631
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Texture is a bit tough. It's a bit flat.

632
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>Paul and Prue must now rank</i>

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In tenth place, we have this one.

634
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

635
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kate, it's slightly wobbly, though,
and it has a soggy middle.

636
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

637
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You lost all the definition in it.

638
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] <i>Yan is eighth. Flo seventh.</i>

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Beautiful shape. I like the flower.
Very, very neatly done. I like that.

-In second place.

643
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Beautifully risen.
It would've been a great loaf

644
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

645
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So in first place is this one.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Good definition. Nice and round.
Good, strong shaping. Very good.

648
00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
First in the Technical on bread week.
I mean, that is massive.

649
00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So excited.

650
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My dough ate itself,
which wasn't a good look.

651
00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

652
00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, what a disaster.

653
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hope there is some redemption there
from this morning.

654
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can be confident
and you know the bake,

655
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you don't know what way that dough's
gonna go. It's got a mind of its own.

656
00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:08.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've gotta just smash it tomorrow.
That's all I've gotta do.

657
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me, the most surprising thing
is the way bread week

661
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Two Star Bakers on the bounce.

667
00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can we talk about Flo for a brief moment?

669
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

670
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the whole time.

671
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

in the Technical as well.

672
00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

673
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I can do this in four hours and thirty...

You've struggled a little bit
on the bread week so far.

839
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. Yesterday was
quite painful, actually.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's really important
that this one works.

841
00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's important, just not that it works
as bread, but that the flavours are good.

842
00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

845
00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At the moment, it looks a bit like
a chicken. That's why I need that model.

846
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The second dough was not quite
the right colour,

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

going with the first one.

848
00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

really centre stage.

919
00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul's gonna pull his head off.

920
00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've got some strong,
bold flavours. The basil's there.

921
00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's very good. Tastes just like pesto.
-Great flavour. Wow.

922
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think we'll try the pumpkin.
It's well-baked. I love the colour.

923
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm trying to hunt the flavour.
I'm not getting much.

924
00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I get the chilli heat,
but I don't get much else.

925
00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's try this focaccia.

926
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:01.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Garlic.

927
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Strong.

928
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Almost too strong.

929
00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not very evenly distributed,
the apricots.

930
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour of the apricot is delicious.

931
00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] What's in this chocolate one?
-[Liam] It's chocolate and date.

932
00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your flavours are fantastic today.

933
00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get in.

934
00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But your proving is a little bit under.

935
00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

936
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the design of the owl.

937
00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The hedgehogs, probably not as much.

938
00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is walnut and raisin, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

939
00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Smells good.

940
00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Saffron's quite strong.

941
00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The walnut and raisin is losing its battle
against the saffron,

942
00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is a real shame.

943
00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Remind me what the green is?

944
00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's matcha green tea.

945
00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Oh, it's matcha. Do you know,
that's too strong for me, too.

946
00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really don't like the flavours, James,

947
00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the design is so bold.
The baking is so good.

948
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The proving is right.
You've got everything right,

949
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-except it doesn't taste nice.
-[laughing]

950
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I think it is so elegantly done.
It's exquisite.

951
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

952
00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I'm gonna take a little cut
of the challah.

953
00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
While I'm here,

954
00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll take a little bit of
the lemon and turmeric.

955
00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Challah is lovely.

956
00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really good.

957
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Taste is all right, but the proving
is wrong. It needed longer.

958
00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The strength of that turmeric is
quite overwhelming. The lemon's lost.

959
00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the design's good.
I think it's been executed well,

960
00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but your flavours are wrong.

961
00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

962
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, Steven, that is amazing.

963
00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It does look mighty impressive.

964
00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna have to destroy that,
this now, you know?

965
00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] It's fine.

966
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

967
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that's unbelievable.

968
00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The delicacy of the crumb,
which is more focaccia-like,

969
00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the flavours that you've got
from the Manchego, from the chorizo.

970
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done. I mean, that's a big tick.

971
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got to find the weak link.

972
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

973
00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's delicious.

974
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a perfect breadstick. Just curly.

975
00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Remind me of this one again,
is it peppermint?

976
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chocolate peppermint breadstick.

977
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's lovely.

978
00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I mean, wow, wow, wow
on the flavours.

979
00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Steven, come here a second.

980
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come here.

981
00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stand next to Prue.

982
00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna go sit down here.

983
00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

984
00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is ridiculous.

985
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thank you, Flo. Can you tell us all about
your coloured bread sculpture, please?

986
00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's supposed to be Tom Jones'...
Tom Jones? Davy Jones' locker.

987
00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Tom Jones' locker
would not look like that.

988
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Flo laughing] Davy Jones' locker.

989
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's very ingenious.

990
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's a little too clumsy
to come off perfectly.

991
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, look at the colour.
There's your three right there.

992
00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Squid ink, turmeric and beetroot.

993
00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The texture is very good. It's baked well
'cause it's more like a ciabatta.

994
00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that what you set out to do?
-No.

995
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could've lied then, Flo.

996
00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I left the door open
and you never walked through.

997
00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

998
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The paprika's quite strong in there.

999
00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This one tastes almost tasteless
because my mouth is still...

1000
00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
burning from the paprika.

1001
00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. The paprika is just overwhelming.

1002
00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Not your best, Flo.

1003
00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

1004
00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love that octopus.

1005
00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the flavour of squid ink,
so I hope we get to get it.

1006
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The squid ink comes through
and it's very suitable for an octopus.

1007
00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is very good.

1008
00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Heavy crust all the way around,
which cracks.

1009
00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beautiful and a regular structure inside.

1010
00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Well done.

1011
00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do like the basket.
I think the plaiting is very, very good.

1012
00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm looking for the definition
in the colour

1013
00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I'm not seeing it too much
at the moment.

1014
00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The apples don't really
look that green, do they?

1015
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The dough's quite underdone.

1016
00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's only marginally underdone,

1017
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and although, of course, the apple inside
has made it a bit wet,

1018
00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's still very pleasant to eat.

1019
00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you've certainly got
your three colours, haven't you?

1020
00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] But having said that,

1021
00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's about getting
the definition in the rose,

1022
00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I think you've lost
some of the definition.

1023
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the definition on the yellow roses
is much better.

1024
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Much better. Yeah.

1025
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I mean, that is really
quite exquisite.

1026
00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] This is the, uh...
-[Tom] Beetroot one.

1027
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, it has a sort of pink hue,
which what you were going for.

1028
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not much flavour, quite bland.
Which is a shame.

1029
00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I like the snail.

1030
00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Is there something about the shape
of the snail you particularly like?

1031
00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1032
00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul, are you going to
pull yourself together?

1033
00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yep. Give me a minute. [clears throat]

1034
00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

1035
00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Well, you certainly have
the three colours, don't you?

1036
00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In fact, you have four colours.

1037
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Beetroot and potato,
oh, just feels so lovely. Look at that.

1038
00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The colour of that is amazing.

1039
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely texture.

1040
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice flavour. I'd like to try this.

1041
00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] This is the rye.

1042
00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow. That's packing a punch, isn't it?
This is gonna be fascinating.

1043
00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Good crust.

1044
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very malty.

1045
00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Great texture, great flavour.

1046
00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Really good bread. All right,
now we're going to attack this fellow.

1047
00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at that. It's goat's cheese and...

1048
00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Caramelized onion.

1049
00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Great taste.

1050
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really fantastic taste.
The goat's cheese in there is delicious.

1051
00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your design is very, very good.
Well thought through.

1052
00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Well done.
-Thank you so much.

1053
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What a memorable Showstopper.
Who stood out for you?

1054
00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Stacey's fallen out of
the possibility of Star Baker.

1055
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think that was good enough.

1056
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Julia's certainly still up there.

1057
00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Julia's was lovely.
The snail was... humorous.

1058
00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With the goat's cheese inside
and the onion, it was delicious.

1059
00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She gave herself a huge job
and she pulled it off.

1060
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, Steven stood out.
That was exceptional.

1061
00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, every single element
to that was perfection.

1062
00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavour combinations were stunning.
Very, very clever.

1063
00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Though I'm not sure
we can give him Star Baker

1064
00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when he did so badly with his teacakes.

1065
00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can we talk about Flo's Tom Jones' locker?

1066
00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The paprika burnt your mouth.

1067
00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:30.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just killed everything.
So much paprika in there.

1068
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's in trouble.

1069
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think she struggled, Flo.
-What about Liam?

1070
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want to shake Liam
because he keeps doing things wrong,

1071
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but he has this brave thing about flavour,
which I love.

1072
00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Has he saved himself? I don't know.

1073
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you think that you two are going to be
in agreement about

1074
00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who's gonna be Star Baker
and who's going to be saying goodbye?

1075
00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think we might not. [laughs]

1076
00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sure we will.

1077
00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In the end.

1078
00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I've seen them, they arm wrestle.
-I know!

1079
00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to say, that's the best bread week
I've ever seen. Well done.

1080
00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have the lovely chore of announcing
who the Star Baker is.

1081
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Star Baker this week is the person
who put the "tea" into teacake

1082
00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and whose Showstopper
was from Russia with Love.

1083
00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's Julia.
-[all applauding]

1084
00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That leaves me with the horrible job
of revealing who's going to leave us.

1085
00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the person that
we have to say goodbye to is...

1086
00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Flo.
-Yep.

1087
00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] I'm sorry.
-[Sandi] Have a hug.

1088
00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm fine, honest to God. I'm fine with it.

1089
00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me get myself together.

1090
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

1091
00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will really miss Flo.

1092
00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm a little bit sad
that she's gone, actually,

1093
00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because I think the world of Flo.

1094
00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Flo] <i>I've enjoyed the ride.</i>
<i>I've met some lovely people,</i>

1095
00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I'll remember that
for the rest of my life.

1096
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm glad to get back to
normal life. [laughs]

1097
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] You are exhausted.

1098
00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought I was going. I need to up
the levels a bit. I've got to do better.

1099
00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Julia is the deserved Star Baker
on bread week.

1100
00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She was incredibly ambitious.

1101
00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[exhales]
I did not expect that whatsoever.

1102
00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

1103
00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it'll be good for Steven
to realize that he's not gonna dominate.

1104
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are other bakers there beginning to
gnaw at his ankles a little bit,

1105
00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I think Julia's one of those.

1106
00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I needed to come down off my little cloud.

1107
00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I gotta practice.</i>

1108
00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm heading back home tonight
and the oven's going on.
