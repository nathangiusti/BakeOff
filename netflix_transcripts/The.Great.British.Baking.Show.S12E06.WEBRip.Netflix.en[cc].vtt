So one kilo of apple
and 200 gram poppyseeds.

87

I mean, she looks really
relaxed as well. Look.

508
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you relaxed?
-I know what parkin is. I'm relieved.

509
00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We were talking last night.

510
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I said, "The only thing I know
that's autumnal is parkin."

511
00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So you said that last night?
-Yeah.

512
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-To this lot?
-Yeah.

513
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're the godmother of parkin.
-Parkin.

514
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How does that feel?
-That's-- That's, erm, scary.

515
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both laughing]

516
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look, she's so in control.

517
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] <i>But even for Gill…</i>

518
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have made parkin
but I've never made a vegan parkin.

519
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>…today's vegan parkin</i>

520
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Baking powder.

521
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>Without eggs,</i>

522
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

523
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is like the only raising agent
in the whole thing.

524
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison] <i>But add too much</i>

525

<i>and the parkin will rise too fast</i>

526
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sumayah] I need
to make sure it's accurate.

527
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even if you get it wrong
by like half a teaspoon,

528
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it can like affect the whole cake.

529
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] <i>Not enough</i>

530
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had baking powder in my hand.

531
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm like, "Did I put it in?"

532
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I… I hope so.

533
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have I got time to do it again anyway?

534
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm adding in all my spices now.

535
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It says ground ginger, ground nutmeg,
ground cinnamon, ground cloves.

536
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no quantities on the spices.

537
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Illiyin] I am basically going to spice it
like I'm spicing Jamaican ginger cake.

538
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jamaican ginger cake is similar
to what I imagine parkin to be like.

539
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you kind of wanna get a good hit.

540
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not sure.

541
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know if it needs to be, like,

542
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
burning-in-your-mouth ginger
or if it should be quite subtle.

543
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bung the ginger in.
-I just gonna go by my taste, you know.

544
00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are these meant to be lightly spiced?
I'd rather have less than too much.

545
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Going easy on the spices this time?
-I think I have.

546
00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's no measurements so mine
is probably gonna be like… [gagging]

547
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Again.

548
00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna put my dry ingredients
into the wet.

549
00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm assuming this is the right way.

550
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I'm just gonna go with it.

551
00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan laughs] I think this
whole thing looks a bit gross. I'm sorry.

552
00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is vile. Do people like this, Gill?

553
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
People like this.
Yes, the people do like this, Dylan.

554
00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Noel] You've got 45 minutes.

556
00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to go in the oven.

557
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sumayah] "Pour the batter
in the prepared tin."

558
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"And bake." Well, let's do that.

559
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sumayah] I'm gonna bake it
for 30 minutes.

560
00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In you go, baby.

561
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gonna take quite a long time
because it's really dense.

562
00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'm going to leave that
for 35 minutes.

564
00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't know what it's meant to look like
but it's baking. [laughs]

565
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Nelly] Now I just gonna wait
till it's bake.

566
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-True.
-This pop-in is over.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you're very neurotic
whereas Alison is more stable.

572
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you think you're neurotic?

573
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And anxious and so my anxiety is based--
-Yeah.

574
00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that what's happening?

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It just makes a negative.
-[Noel] I'll take that on board.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

585
00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You put that in and if there's goo on it,
no good. If it's clean, good.

586
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, it's not very high, mine.
It's as flat as a pancake.

and didn't put it in, I've no idea.

a last place, isn't it?

Taking off some of the edge
so it doesn't look as sunk as it is.

607
00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

but you can also add parsnip.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It depends on how much water there is,

748
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got to get rid of some moisture.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Christiaan] Gonna check on the cakes.

917
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna give them a few minutes more
just because they're quite wet.

918
00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Illiyin] I don't want
any moisture anywhere.

919
00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're all fine.

920
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Happy days. Just need to cool now.

921
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cooling time is the killer.

922
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoa!

923
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[groaning] That's so annoying.

924
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Georgie] Oh, good God.

925
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you okay?

926
00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll bake another cake.

927
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Dylan, what's gone down?
-I just threw my cake on the floor.

928
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, what you doing?
-I dunno, mate.

929
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you got time to make it again?
-I've got more batter in the fridge.

930
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're a cool customer.

931
00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean…

932
00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No panics.

933
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now I'm glad I over-made extra batter.
I have an hour to bake it. It's tight.

934
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>While Dylan has the daunting task</i>

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey. Now we've gotta go again.

936
00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales] I've got more to do now.

937
00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a treacle biscuit dough.

939
00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can't go to a showstopper with a cake.
You need bells and whistles to go with it.

940
00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or rockets and fireworks in this case.

[Christiaan] My cake will be

943
00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gonna have stained glass windows.

944
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] That's me. [laughs]

945
00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I posed for that picture. [laughs]

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

947
00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Georgie] I'm gonna make a mini pumpkin.

948
00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna cover this with quite a lot

949
00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause then it'll scrunch and make
the pumpkin shape with the strings.

950
00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now we're using a death weapon,
AKA a mandolin.

951
00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Try not to slice my fingers off.

952
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm shaping them
into rough flower shapes.

953
00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I'm gonna dehydrate them.

954
00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just enough time.

955
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think-- How long do we have left?

956
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have one hour left.

957
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

958
00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Nelly] Is one hour now. [sighs]
-[Sumayah] These need to go in the oven.

959
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Noel] It's tense.

960
00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They get worried
and then they pull it out of the bag.

961
00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's loads to do.

962
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know, but you're not supposed
to present it from a bag.

963
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Dylan] I'm waiting for it to bake.
So I'm gonna make my peacock cake topper.

965
00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] It's big. It's rising.

966
00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. But I need it to cool.

967
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which would leave me ten minutes
to decorate the top tier.

968
00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

978
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Illiyin] Nice and moist inside.
It's cooked the way carrot cake should be.

979

982
00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

983
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These ones look okay.
I might just do three tiers.

984
00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan] So it's gonna be, like,
cake, marrow jam, buttercream.

985
00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] Because I'm down a layer
I'll do a thicker layer of buttercream.

986

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] It'll be an all-white cake.
Make it marble is my thought process.

I'd say that's absolutely
the right level of spice.

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not too strong, delicious.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:35.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the carrot and courgette
are moist enough still.

It's pleasant in the mouth.

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looking forward to the spices on this one.

1133
00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[snickers] I think
they're okay on this one.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1135
00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a carrot and pumpkin cake

1136
00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the cream cheese frosting
has stem ginger, little bit of cinnamon.

1137
00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a little damp.

1138
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pumpkin, it's probably released
quite a bit of juice.

1139
00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1140
00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's well iced.
You've done a nice job on the hat.

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, let's have a slice, shall we?

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1152
00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is a spinach, vanilla sponge

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your cake's concertinaed up
because it's a light cake.

1156
00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've put seven layers on,
it's gone like that and then it's dense.

1157
00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-And this is a terrific achievement.

1158
00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a huge cake.

1159
00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it is slightly overcomplicated.

1160
00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause it's difficult to distinguish
that many flavours.

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, design's excellent. Flavour's…

1167
00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I said a bit. It's a lot messy.

1168
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is a festival
that's meant to celebrate something.

1169
00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You look at it, that doesn't look like
it's celebrating much.

1170
00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. I know, yeah.

1171
00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think you needed
to do the covering better

1172
00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so that it really was totally white.

1173
00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
However, let's have a look inside.

1174
00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's a beetroot and orange cake
with cardamom and cream cheese frosting.

1175
00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the flavour. I think it's gorgeous.

It's light. It lifts it up.

1226
00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1228
00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That means I have got the horrible job
of announcing

1229
00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1232
00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not going anywhere!

1233
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1234
00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:43.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm sorry.

1235
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1236
00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not commiseration. It's a positive.

1237
00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I never, ever was thinking
I would come to round six.

1238
00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me, everything above round three
was a bonus. Bonus game.

1239
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1240
00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe I am only the sixth place,
but you know what,

1241
00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's not to teach them win,
it's to teach them enjoy.

1242
00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course I'm happy.

1245
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In each of your hearts
is a piece of Nelly,

1246
00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you're never gonna forgot me,
and that was my aim.

1247
00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1248

1249
00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You need to make me proud.

1250
00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I, er, definitely got off lucky, 100%.

1251
00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, I think I need to start taking it
a bit more serious

1252
00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because nothing's as bad
as what happened today.

1253
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was the worst feeling in the world.

1254
00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like extra happy because everyone
this week genuinely did amazing.

1255
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So like to get Star Baker,
I'm really happy. [laughs]

1256
00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's only six of us left now,
so, yeah, that's crazy.

1257
00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1258
00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you, you not going anywhere.

1259
00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:49.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
