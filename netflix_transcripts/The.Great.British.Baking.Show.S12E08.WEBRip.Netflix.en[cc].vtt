Hi! Welcome to the show. It's '70s Week.

2
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've had my hair done specially
in a '70s style.

3
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now it is '70s Week,

4
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's a very serious,
sophisticated show,

5
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so we won't be doing those clichés
like disco balls,

6
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
apart from Paul Hollywood's.

7
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we certainly
won't be doing lava lamps.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As I said, this is a serious affair.

9
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yee-haw, baby!

10
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the best!

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[snickers] I have to laugh
'cause I'll cry.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

33
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yeah.

34
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Quarterfinal. I didn't think
I'd make it this far.

35
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I feel like now if I go home,
at least I can be like,

36
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

37
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

38
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We started with 12.
We're five and I'm still here

39
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

but also, it's like,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

that I am here in the quarterfinal

And now I'm like,
"Right, babes, get to the final." [laughs]

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Welcome back to the tent, bakers,
for 1970s Week.

52
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it's incredible.

57
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, for this week's signature bake,

58
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the judges would like you to bake
that 1970s classic, profiteroles.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Now the judges are looking
for a decorative stack

60
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of at least 30 profiteroles.

61
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can use any style of filling you like

62
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but when it comes to the flavours,
think 1970s.

63
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So prawn cocktail, coal.

64
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got two hours and 30 minutes.

66
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Georgie] Right, here we go now.

71
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know nothing much about the '70s.

72
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was 20 years off, so. [laughs]

73
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't remember the '70s, do you?
You're too young.

74
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wasn't there, hon.

75
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-When was you born?
-2004.

76
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No!
-[Dylan] Yeah.

-Oh, my God, everyone's so young in here.

78
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Food in the '70s gets a bad rap today.

79
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, our idea is that we should revive

80
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
some of those classic '70s bakes
and see what the bakers make of it.

81
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And so, our signature challenge
is profiteroles, which were very '70s.

82
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do like a profiterole.

83
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't like stacking 'em with
hot caramel, but I like a profiterole.

84
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The key thing about this challenge
is getting the choux right.

85
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's about that dropping consistency.

86
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Too much egg and it won't rise
as much as it should.

87
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They'll be like bellinis.

88
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No pressure. It'll be fine, it'll be fine.

89
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A good-size profiterole
is almost slightly larger than a…

90
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I suppose, a walnut.

91
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they have too big a profiterole
and fill it full of cream, which is soft,

92
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it will soften the profiterole.

93
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you're doing a stack,
chances are it will collapse.

-Christiaan, good morning.
-Good morning. How are you?

96
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Christiaan, tell us
about your profiterole.

97
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna do a Black Forest gateau.

98
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So we've got a chocolate choux pastry,

99
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and for the filling,
we got a kirsch and cherry jam

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

in the second batch.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

of a buttery shortcrust pastry case

with a beautifully piped Chantilly cream.

454
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have two hours and 30 minutes.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's no instructions whatsoever.
He's literally just given us the quantity.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think it needs to be that sweet,
but we'll see.

470
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyway, it looks beautiful.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a classic 1970s cake, essentially.
But it's all about the textures.

472
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The shortcrust pastry,
the caramel and the cream.

473
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, we haven't actually
given them a recipe.

474
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At all?

475
00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. They've got all the ingredients,
but we haven't given them the method.

476
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They should know how to make a shortcrust.

477
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if you overdo your water,
it'll end up like rubber.

478
00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You want that crack.
-Yeah. That's good pastry.

479
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The second part is the caramel.

480
00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you take your caramel too far,
it goes bitter,

481
00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you won't get the flavour of a caramel
which is what you want.

482
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sold now. You've told me
that it's delicious, I'll believe it.

the pastry dough first.

490
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

butter and sugar in here.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I don't add too much water to it.

a bit more water.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

'cause at the moment it looks dry,

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

becoming a bit too tough.

but it still looks quite crumbly.

I'm gonna roll it.
I think it'll need to be quite thin

512
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because this is the quantity
they've given us for that size tin.

513
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Gill] Well, pastry's going in the tin.

514
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want it to be thin
but you want it to hold.

515
00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] I like its look.
It's crumbling on the edges.

516
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How're you doing?
You must be feeling good. Handshake.

517
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Handshake, Dylan.
-It's throwing me off more than I thought.

518
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] Why?
-[Dylan] I've never made this before.

519
00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks like a nice pastry.

520
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, you haven't got a method,
but who needs it when you're Dylan?

521
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's going in with the baking beans.

522
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:35.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna give it 15 minutes like that
and see how we're doing.

523
00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I honestly have no clue
how long to bake this for.

524
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it takes about half an hour.
I'm not too sure.

525
00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are we at the stage now
where we're so competitive?

526
00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could you ask anybody?

527
00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No one would say.
-It's one of those situations?

528
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You can't ask. They'd be like…
-Before you were friends.

529
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Now we're enemies.
-[both laugh]

530
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan] So now
I'm starting the caramel.

531
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs] It's not always
my strong point, I guess.

532
00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I said before I came in,
"Don't let it be caramel again."

533
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Illiyin] I'm melting my sugar.
I don't want it to catch.

534
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan] You wanna take it far
but not too far,

535
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause in an instant it just goes burnt.

536
00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See the sweat down my forehead?

537
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you really hot?
-I have a vest on under there.

538
00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What is this? Velvet?
-Velvet, yeah.

539
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Velvet! Who wears velvet
on the hottest day of the year?

540
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I know, mate.
-[laughing] What are you…

541
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a bad idea.
-[laughing]

542

543
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers! You are halfway through.

544
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Gill] That's been 15 minutes.

545
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Georgie] I'm gonna get my pastry out,

546
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
take the beans off
and I'll put it back in to bake.

547
00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan] It doesn't get a colour.
It's just pale.

548
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beans out, back in it goes.

549
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Georgie] It's going in.
-You've made a banoffee.

550
00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't like banoffee.
I don't like bananas.

551
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What? Don't like bananas?
-The texture of them. They're slimy.

552
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ever have a straight banana?

553
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm, no. I've had one that's long
and straight and then curved at the end.

554
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pew! Go away!

555
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so gullible, Noel.

556
00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll just answer to anything,
so don't do it to me.

557
00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. So the sugar's melted nicely.

558
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're gonna get the cream in
and then get it up to temperature.

559
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] If you go too far,
you can get it too chewy like a toffee.

560
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Take it off too soon,
it'll be like a pouring sauce.

561
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just took it to a light caramel,
not too dark.

562
00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This isn't the kind of thing
you want dark caramel for.

563
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

564
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This always seems to take forever.

565
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
See, it's going thick there.
Yeah. [sighs] Fingers crossed.

566
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan] It's set nicely on the sides.
That's good.

I'm just gonna add a little bit
of happiness in here.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

587
00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wouldn't do it again.

[Georgie] The pastry's ready,
to be honest.

592
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's been in there 45 minutes.

593
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't procrastinate any longer.

594
00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Illiyin] That looks quite good.
It'd be gutting to have a soggy bottom.

595
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Part of me wants
to bake this a bit longer.

596
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Split there, but there's nothing
I can do about that now.

597
00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it's just cooling times now.

598
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So let's get on to the cream.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

for the Chantilly cream

600
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I whip up some double cream,
vanilla extract and icing sugar.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

603
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] I'll get my caramel in.
I haven't got enough time.

604
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Illiyin] It's thinner
than I would have thought

605
00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it'll now sit in the case
and hopefully just set.

606
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Gill] I had a crack at the bottom
which I thought I'd bung, but we'll see.

607
00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] I dunno what I'm doing.
My caramel might not set.

608
00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would just eat it like that.
I would not mind.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

610
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The good news is, so far,
the banana is not sinking.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] Scales of banana
is what I'm doing.

612
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Christiaan] I love bananas.

613
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

are in a bit of trouble.

718
00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Illiyin, obviously, had the issue
with the profiteroles,

719
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and fourth in the technical automatically
puts her in a precarious position today.

720
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Gill's profiteroles weren't bad.

721
00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] Yeah.
-It was just a little bit bland.

722
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It needed more pop to it.

723
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And when it came to the technical,
she was last.

724
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You look at Dylan,

725
00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when I first walked in
and saw everybody's profiteroles,

726
00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Dylan's looked like a professional bake.
-[Alison] Yeah.

727
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Christiaan did well on the signature,

728
00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and he was second
in the technical as well.

729
00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's one to watch this week.
And I would put Georgie in there as well.

730
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I always think that Georgie's
strength is that she is a classic baker,

731
00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but whereas Christiaan
will take much more risks.

732
00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:01.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At the moment, we have Georgie, Christiaan
and Dylan in line for Star Baker.

733
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

734
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I think we have Illiyin
and Gill down at the bottom.

735
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Scrapping it out to stay.

739
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's time for your
1970s showstopper challenge.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So for this challenge,
the judges would like you to bake

741
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a beautifully decorated gateau
with at least two tiers.

742
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] The judges would love you
to create a showstopper

743

745
00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got four hours

750
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it's… it's scary.

751
00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I'm at the bottom of the pile,
so, yeah, a big bake today.

752
00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For me, a gateau is all about softness.

753
00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A nice soft sponge, lots of cream.

754
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Almost trifle-like,
but without being a trifle.

755
00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If the bakers are after
a really light gateau,

756
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they should go for a genoise.

757
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A genoise sponge is made
by whipping the eggs

758
00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to incorporate as much air as I can.

759
00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the only thing it relies on
for the rising in the oven.

760
00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:20.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This isn't my favourite cake to make
as it can be very temperamental.

761
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The piped decoration is the most
difficult we've asked them to do

762
00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it takes ages
to do really good piping.

763
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We want to see lots of little loops
and rosettes and all that stuff.

764
00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's the difference
between cake and gateau?

765
00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's the cream.

766
00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] In between the cake?
-Yep.

767
00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did not know.
That means it might deteriorate quicker.

768
00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:42.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It could collapse.

769
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison] Ah.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you need to keep that quite central

772
00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

that will be painful.

776
00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Illiyin, tell us all about
your 1970s gateau.

777
00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:08.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I am making a two-tiered
peach melba vintage-style gateau.

785
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, because of the genoise
and the lightness of it, and the cream,

786
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

white chocolate ganache for the outside.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ganache is so stable.
Once it's on the outside, it won't budge.

[Christiaan] This one's a bit tricky
because there's a lot of flour to fold in,

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I'm just concerned about the peppermint.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the, erm, mascarpone cream.

1126
00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue chuckles] Very chocolatey,
I'm glad to say.

1127
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's delicious. Really nice.

1128
00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The texture's quite open and light.
-[Gill] Yeah.

1129
00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I tell you what's a stroke of genius
is those cherries.

1130
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're an explosion of flavour.

1131
00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Took me back to the '70s, that did.

1132
00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Gill laughs]

1133
00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Mission accomplished.

1134
00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Well done, Gill.
-Thank you.

1135
00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did it as well as I could do it.

1136
00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Am I still at risk? Very probably.

1137
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's gonna come down
to the smallest of margins again.

1138
00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right now
I feel really disappointed in myself.

1139
00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm… yeah.

1140
00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't even know how I feel,
to be honest.

1141
00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was more worried about the look,
I should've been worried about the taste.

1142
00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

1143
00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The feedback is confusing to take
because it was like,

1144
00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Wow, you made a really good cake,
but you can't taste it."

1145
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which is fair enough.

1146
00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm over the moon with that.

1147
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Getting to the semi-finals
would mean everything. I'd rejoice.

1148
00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd be rolling round the fields.

1149
00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[munching]

1150
00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sheep bleats]

1151
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, that was a dramatic showstopper.

1152
00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was. It was a bit sad
about Illiyin's cake.

1153
00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is there any saving Illiyin?

1154
00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, listen, we've had people
who've messed up a bake in the past

1155
00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and have thrown things in bins.

1156
00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Illiyin didn't throw it away.
-[Alison] Yeah.

1157
00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She brought it up,
which is what you should do.

1158
00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Such a shame though, 'cause, Prue,
her flavours are bang on most of the time.

1159
00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If this was a trifle competition,
she'd have won it.

1160
00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Really?
-[Paul] Yeah.

1161
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I was a bit worried
about the sponge quality.

1162
00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Does worrying about sponge quality
keep you up at night?

1163
00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-All the time.
-[laughs]

1164
00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gill really pulled it out.

1165
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I mean, she absolutely…
-Yeah.

1166
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was a neat cake.

1167
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look over the three challenges,
don't forget Gill was bottom in technical.

1168
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] Could Christiaan
be in trouble today?

1169
00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He was a bit of a letdown, if I'm honest.
-Shame. It looked so good.

1170
00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was a pity because
I didn't realise there was half a tonne

1171
00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of chopped hazelnuts in his sponge.

1172
00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] And three litres of alcohol.

1173
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[both laughing]
-It was just so potent.

1174
00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It wasn't nice to eat.
-Was it not?

1175
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the first time
I can say that about his food.

1176
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the peppermint cowboy?

1177
00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The problem was, there wasn't enough choc
in the mint choc chip.

1178
00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you tasted the chocolate cake by itself
it was perfect.

1179
00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Georgie's Black Forest gateau
was particularly good.

1180
00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I thought I'd never say this,
but it was too boozy.

1181
00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wouldn't like more than a teacup of it.

1182
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Georgie's had a good week, right?

1183
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Must be in line for Star Baker.

1184
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would say Dylan and Georgie
in line for Star Baker.

1185
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yeah.

1186
00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And Christiaan, Gill or Illiyin
to go home.

1187
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well done, bakers,
we got through 1970s Week.

1188
00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now I've got the great job of announcing
this week's Star Baker.

1189
00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:35.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And Star Baker this week is…

1190
00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Georgie.

1191
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Christiaan] Georgie.

1192
00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[all cheering]
-Thank you.

1193
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1194
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unfortunately,
I've got the job of announcing

1195
00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which baker's gonna be
leaving the tent today.

1196
00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So here we go.

1197
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The baker leaving the tent today is…

1198
00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Illiyin.

1199
00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, darling.

1200
00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:07.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's okay.

1201
00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Georgie] Love you.

1202
00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's all right.
-Love you.

1203
00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:14.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a funny thing. I feel like
I can drop my shoulders a little bit

1204
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and be like, "At least you don't
have to go and practise patisserie."

1205
00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sniffles]

1206
00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even all these feelings of sadness,

1207
00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
underneath all of that is, I think,
an immense sense of pride.

1208
00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I'm glad to have that.

1209
00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Honestly, you're a very good baker
and you're a wonderful woman,

1210
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you should be very proud.

1211
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is an exceptional competition
with exceptional bakers,

1212
00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and to have been part of it,
that's quite special.

1213
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But, yeah, over and out, <i>Bake Off.</i>

1214
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's done. [chuckles]

1215
00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] And you pulled yourself up.
-I know.

1216
00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pulled off the great escape once again.

1217
00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How am I a semi-finalist in <i>Bake Off?</i>

1218
00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Semi-finals, baby. Like… [laughs]

1219
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's insane.

1220
00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's really good. I mean,
I didn't think I'd make it this far.

1221
00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My prediction is that next week
is gonna be very tense.

1222
00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it will be everyone
pulling out really good recipes.

1223
00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God. That was mad.

1224
00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Noel] You beat him.

1225
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] No, he's had two…
Have you had three?

1226
00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, two.
-[Georgie giggles]

1227
00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
