00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Crystelle] It's leaning, and I'm sure
that's not gonna do me favours.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By stacking it, you're retaining the heat.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

355
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are a couple of dowels in there,

359
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, and it's well balanced.

360
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I particularly like your baby carrots.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think it looks very nice.
I love the pipe work.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A bit solid.
-[Chigs] Yeah.

365
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] You had a lot of carrot

366
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the carrot releases water
once it's in the batter.

367
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the pineapple works well.
That bit of sweetness comes through it.

368
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You expect a little bit of stodge
with a carrot cake.

369
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But this is a little bit rubbery.
-Okay.

370
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were affected by heat.
It wasn't cold when you put it together

371
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and therefore
you've got a bit of movement.

372
00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But it's fairly level.
-[Prue] Yeah, I like the look of it.

373
00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's three layers of sponge
with figs and walnut jam in between.

374
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It has an absolutely delicious flavour,
but the texture is very soft.

375
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Because the cake was warm
when you did it,

376
00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that's what's causing you to think,
"Is it underbaked, stodgy?" It's not.

377
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just you've got the cream cheese
and you've got the jam

378
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it's soaking into a warm cake.

379
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So that's…
-It's added moisture.

380
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yes, it has.

381
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think the flavours are delicious.
The idea of introducing figs was good.

382
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it still tastes like carrot cake.
Which is important.

383
00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

they managed to see through that.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The fact that I made my least
nice-looking cake on the final

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is probably not the most fortunate thing.

389
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] The thing is, nobody smashed it.

[Matt] You have two and a half hours.

408
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Get set.

[sing-song] Bake!

410
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that it?
-Are you taking the mick?

411
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

412
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] What are you laughing at?
-There's two instructions.

413
00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Oh, my God. That's it?
-Yeah!

414
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
"Make Belgian buns.
Fill it with lemon curd and sultanas."

415
00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's cracking.

416
00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've done a cinnamon bun so I feel
like that's enough bun knowledge.

417
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe today's the day
that I do well on a Technical.

418
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never seen a Belgian bun.
I have no idea what they look like.

419
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul, for our final Technical Challenge,
we've got Belgian buns.

420
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You haven't taken all the method out,
have you?

421
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[laughing] Paul,

422
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that's unbelievably unkind.

423
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You can see
where it's been coiled around.

424
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Yeah.
-[Paul] You should get that lemon,

425
00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and a bit of sweetness
coming from the icing.

426
00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just got that bit of chewiness,
which I like.

427
00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think there'll be any trouble
with them making the dough.

428
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And of course they know
how to make lemon curd.

429
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's what to do with them
when they've got them.

430
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, how did they know
what a Belgian bun looks like?

431
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've got three great bakers in there.
Someone will get it right.

432
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's an enriched dough.
I've done enriched dough in the past.

433
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This will be a very sticky dough.
It's gonna be very difficult to handle.

434
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] You need
to work the hell out of it

435
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to work up all that gluten.

436
00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My dad used to do this very often
when we made pizza dough.

437
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Refine the dough," he said.
I don't know what <i>that</i> means.

438
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At last, I'm as tall as Giuseppe.

439
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's not something to be proud of.
-Hello.

440
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's no more Italian thing
you could be doing right now than this.

441
00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If there was an advert made for Giuseppe,

442
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-this is what you'd be doing isn't it?
-There you go.

443
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It will go, [dramatically]<i> "Giuseppe,</i>

444
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>-Giuseppe.</i>
-That sounds like a very American accent.

445
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-If I ever make it to Hollywood,

449
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll give you a shout.

450
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] Dough done.

451
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm now gonna prove this
for an hour minimum.

452
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>Paul's demanded</i>

453
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I made an orange curd this morning.

454
00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

455
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you seen that? Paul Vaguey-wood.
-Really helpful.

456
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have never made curd. Ever.

457
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's gonna be a wild guess.

458
00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lemon curd looks very much like a custard.

459
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it needs to be
like a creamy liquidy thingy.

460
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] Okay,
curd has gone in the freezer,

461
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-just to chill.
-[Chigs] Mmm.

462
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] Does this look like
a curd to you?

463
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm saying nothing. "Belgian Buns."

464
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do you know what they look like?
-Do you not know?

465
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Some sort of cinnamon bun swirled up.

466
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have you been to Belgium?

467
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've been to Belgium a few times.

468
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-Have you? Why?

469
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you are halfway through.

470
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks like it's twice the size.

471
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] I think that's fine.

472
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] The question is,
how do we shape this?

473
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know what to do now.

474
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just don't know what that man wants.

475
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is no point in going back
to the instructions,

476
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
because they say, "Make the Belgian buns."

477
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs] God, it's really hard.
[laughing] God, I hate this.

478
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] Matt's mentioned
a swirl somewhere.

479
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So they might be like cinnamon buns.

480
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Roll it out, spread the curd…

481
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sprinkle the sultanas?

482
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll roll this out flat,
spread over the curd,

483
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
sprinkle all the sultanas,
roll it up like a little sausage.

484
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs grumbles]

485
00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Split the dough into two
and get a rough rectangle shape.

486
00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] I want them to get
an even, thick layer of curd.

487
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is going to all be very tight.

488
00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] It is very tricky because
they did say, "Perfect swirl."

489
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] The longer your dough,
the more of a swirl you'll get,

490
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because you can really roll it up.

491
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] Let's see what happens.

492
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] I can only hope
that this is right.

493
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Each roll needs to be the same.
I'm sure they'll want uniformity.

494
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] How thick should each bun be?

495
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If the buns have to be like cinnamon buns,

496
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they would have to be
a couple centimetres each.

497
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] If I do 1.2.

498
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] Five.

499
00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It needs to be a significant swirl.

500
00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think whenever they ask for a swirl,
it has to be visible.

501
00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] Mine look too high.

502
00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I rolled it the wrong way.
I rolled it long way upwards.

503
00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whereas those guys have done
the short side and gone that way.

504
00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] And we have lift-off.

505
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can't do anything now.

506
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

507
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry. I was
just on the ceiling, eating bugs.

508
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

509
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] I'm just going in at 180.

they did give us.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe] I'll go for 20 minutes first.

512
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fingers and toes crossed,
say a little prayer and hope for the best.

513
00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Coffee time.

514
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have 15 minutes left.

515
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] They look a little bit pale.
Hmm.

516
00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] They're browning.
It's looking good so far.

517
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] I think
they should be golden brown.

518
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know, is the honest answer.

519
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll keep them in there
until they are an even brown colour.

520
00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] The swirl's
the only thing I'm worried about.

521
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's only three of us now.
I could be in last position.

524
00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. Unless I've burnt them.
What should I do? What should I do?

525
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just chill out.
Don't worry about it. It's only the final.

526
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] I might be
cutting it a bit fine.

527
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I might have to cut this down
by about two to four minutes.

528
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By doing that,
it should give me enough time

529
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
for my buns to cool before I glaze them.
Before I ice them.

530
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't, Matt, come on.

531
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm better than that.
-You're better than that. Don't you dare!

532
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The tension is palpable.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Bakers,
you have ten minutes remaining.

534
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

535
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] They look like baked.
They just look very small.

536
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

537
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The worst thing that can happen
is that they are underbaked.

538
00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

539
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'll keep them
another couple of minutes.

540
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] They need to cool
because I need to put icing on them.

541
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just stick them in the freezer.
Do not drop. [gasps]

542
00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

546

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

should look like?

548
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] Taking them out now.

550
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Chigs] I'll put icing on it.
-[Crystelle] I can do this. I can do this.

551
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] I hope
I haven't overbaked them.

552
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Some of them are very dark.

553
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Why are my hands shaking?

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Cherry in the middle.

556
00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm almost there.
There's no time to waste.

557
00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

They're too small, too high.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This theme is the Mad Hatter's tea party.

643
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, we should have a feeling

644
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

645
00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We want

646
00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A little bit of sweet, a bit of savoury

647
00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

649
00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you've got an empty oven,

652
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

654
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And a whole display

668
00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

That's interesting.
I thought Jairzeno left in week two.

830
00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe] The batter is slightly too wet.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] This is gonna go in the oven

833
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I only learned this from bread week
that it's supposed to be so oily.

834
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The peas are there just to give
some sweetness and creaminess.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

You wanna, what,
just smash him in the throat?

856
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, hats.

857
00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

858
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He also has the power to
change the result.

859
00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-No.

861
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This should be my focaccia.

862
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I might just prove it.

863
00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's really hard 'cause
there's piping hot oil in there.

866
00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is Mr. Spatula. You just have to
kiss his head and then you win.

867
00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She wouldn't do it and he wouldn't do it.

868
00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

869
00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

870
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to bake my biscuits,
then it's a case of decorating everything.

871
00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Completed it, mate.

[Matt] <i>It's judgement time</i>
<i>for this year's final Showstoppers.</i>

926
00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Giuseppe. Would you like to bring out
your Showstopper?

927
00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God.

928
00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very precarious.

929
00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue chuckles]

930
00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

931
00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's simple and effective.

932
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are all very small.
I expected them to be a little bit bigger.

933
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

934
00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I don't mind
because it's a caterpillar.

935
00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The caterpillar is choux buns

936
00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with asparagus, peas filling
and mascarpone topping.

937
00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm. Delicious.
You certainly get the asparagus. And pea.

938
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because it's been filled
with this creamy mixture,

939
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they're quite soft now.

940
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which is a pity,
because it's all the same texture.

941
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm.
-[Paul] Let's look at the sweet bread.

942
00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] So the centrepiece is filled
with chocolate and hazelnut.

943
00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Goodness!
That is quite complicated.

944
00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

945
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's very Italian in its flavour.
-[Prue] Isn't it?

946
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I like it, the bread is so crispy.

947
00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is lovely.

948
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] This is the…
-[Giuseppe] Orange and figs.

949
00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Orange and fig.
-[Prue] They're very cute.

950
00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're very soft, they're juicy,
and they have a lovely flavour to 'em.

951
00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] They're very good.
-You can take one of these, Prue.

952
00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] They're passion fruit,
mango, panna cotta

953
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with brandy snaps.

954

955
00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The panna cotta is delicious.

956
00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles] I mean, it really is stunning.

957
00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] That is the most perfect texture
for a panna cotta.

958
00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just set and it sort of cracks
as you touch it.

959
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I might finish this one.
-[Prue] Mmm.

960
00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm taking it away with me.
-Yeah, you did well. Thanks very much.

961
00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

962
00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I like the choux buns.

963
00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Love the heart cakes.

964
00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And the panna cotta is bliss.
-Thank you very much.

965
00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

968
00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Chigs, would you like to bring
your final Showstopper up here?

969
00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please may I have a hand
carrying it to the front, Matt?

970
00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Massive.
-[Chigs] Sorry.

971
00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To me.

To you.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Okay.
-[Paul] Thank you.

976
00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[inhales deeply]

977
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm quite impressed
with the overall look of them.

978
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've got the Mad Hatter's
tea party very well.

979
00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the colour of the cat…
I love the cards.

980
00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-These are particularly interesting to me.
-[Prue] There's something mad.

981
00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which is part of
the sort of surreal thing.

982
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] These clocks look quite neat.

983
00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Shall we start with the savoury first?
-Yeah, why not?

984
00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] Chicken, sweet leek
and mushroom pies.

985
00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

One of my favourite things.

987
00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very nice pastry.
Has it got thyme in there?

988
00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thyme and tarragon.
-[Prue] That was delicious.

989
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a brioche?

990
00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] Yes.
Filled with a lemon and lime crème pat.

991
00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Delicious crème pat.

992
00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's beautiful. It's nice and sweet,
but just the right level of sweetness.

993
00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

994
00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] These are shortbread biscuits

995
00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

997
00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The punched-out hearts
are charming.

998
00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1001
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's a nice, buttery biscuit.
I'm not getting the elderflower.

1002
00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1003
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.

1004
00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1007
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got orange curd
and mascarpone cream in the middle.

1008
00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was looking forward
to the Cheshire cat's grin.

1009
00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know. I'd kind of run out of time.

1012
00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1013
00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're left with a beautiful
floral flavour in your mouth.

1014
00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] You've not put too much buttercream
round the edge, so it's not too sweet.

1015
00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1035
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] It looks quite impressive.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I like the little sunflowers

1037
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What did you say

1038
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're called nankhatais. They've got
brown butter, cardamom and nuts.

1041
00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got a lovely balance of flavours
with the spices in there.

1042
00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1044
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which are chai sponges

1045
00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that cake is really delicious.
It's very soft.

1046
00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1047
00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then the cooling from the cream cheese,
it blends nicely together.

[Paul] This is hot water crust pastry.

1050
00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] Yeah. Filled with chickpea

1051
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1053
00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite solid. But I really like that.

1054
00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Absolutely lovely.
-It's a Goan curry? It's delicious.

1055
00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got a lovely kick to it as well.

1056
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's three out of four.

1057

-[Paul] Right. Focaccia.
-[Prue] Yeah.

1059
00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] Which is a za'atar,
garlic and honey focaccia.

Er…

1062
00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is not recognizable as focaccia.

1063
00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Crystelle] Oh, no!
-That's raw dough.

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What have you done? That is raw.
-[Crystelle] I don't know.

1066
00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Has it been in the oven?
-Yeah.

1067
00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know what happened.

1068
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's bizarre.
-[Paul] There's no rise at all.

1069
00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's inedible, that one.

1070
00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] That's a pity.
-[Paul] Never seen anything like it.

1071
00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm really sorry. I don't know
what happened. That's bizarre.

1072
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But over all, I think your flavours
of what we did try was very good.

1073
00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1074
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1075
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] Obviously,
I focus on the negatives, right?

1076
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There was a big fat negative in there.

1077
00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just baffled.

1078
00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How the hell did that happen
to my focaccia?

1079
00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe] I feel confused.

1080
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pretty much everybody
had very good comments,

1081
00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
something that didn't quite meet
the expectations of the judges.

1082
00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't nervous.

1083
00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've been waiting
all this time now. Ten weeks.

1084
00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
