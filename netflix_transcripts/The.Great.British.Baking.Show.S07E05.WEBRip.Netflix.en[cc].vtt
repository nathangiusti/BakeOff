What I'm doing now is decoration

305
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that can be thrown on
when I have one minute left.

306
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Helena] I'm almost there.

307
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry] Coming out quite cloudy, isn't it?

308
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michael] Yeah, it's looking good.

309
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Will the entire jelly melt?
That is the question.

310
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] Bakers...
-You have one minute left.

311
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sixty seconds.

312
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] It's been quite stressful,
this one.

313
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kind of just, er, making it up
as I go along, to be honest.

314
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

315
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michelle] God, I can't get it off.

316
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosie] That jelly is melting.

317
00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything is just going wrong
in the world right now.

318
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up.

319
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Please place your custard pies
at the end of your benches.

320
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rosie] I don't think
there's the possibility of

321
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
anything going any worse
in my life right now.

322
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel]<i> It's judgment time</i>

323
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks like a custard pie
you'd see in a French patisserie shop.

324
00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Yeah.

325
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very professional,
very neat on the outside.

326
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is absolutely exquisite.

327
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've managed to make these
flapper girls look quite flirty. [laughs]

328
00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The base
to the amount of custard, perfect.

329
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beautifully cooked.

330
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Just cooked.

331
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a custard pie.

332
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's silky-smooth. Delicious.

333
00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

334
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah!

335
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all applauding]

336
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a perfect custard pie.

337
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The base, crumbly, crispy.

338
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The custard baked to perfection.

339
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beautifully level, filled to the top.

340
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then the design, impeccable.

341
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wonderful, David.

342
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

343
00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the decoration.
I think the decoration is very good.

344
00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not full enough.
You could've had more filling in there.

345
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That custard texture looks perfect.

346
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It looks lovely and silky.

347
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The balance with the ginger is perfect.

348
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's baked beautifully.

349
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you'd had more custard in there,

350
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and a little bit neater on the top,
you're looking at perfection.

351
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a beautiful pie.
-Wow.

352
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done. Thank you.
-[Michael] Thank you.

353
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

354
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Oh, dear.

355
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened with the decoration?

356
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, surprise, surprise,
I ran out of time.

357
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] You could have had
a little more custard in there.

358
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Priya] Yes.

359
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] You've boiled it, basically.

360
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And so what's happened is it's bubbled up.

361
00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And as you brought it out...

362
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You bring it out, and then it sinks.
-[Priya] Yeah.

363
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It tastes amazing.

364
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Problem is, you boiled your custard,
and your pastry's too thick.

365
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Paul] Far too thick.

366
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is there booze in there?
-[Alice] No.

367
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, so, orange juice, orange zest,
and a bit of orange extract as well.

368
00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:13.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Celebrate the orange with the zest,
not with an extract.

369
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me, the flavour has been overwhelmed
by that extract.

370
00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Okay.

371
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The decoration, it's simplistic
but quite effective.

372
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The colour of it looks good.
-[Steph] Okay.

373
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It looks like the perfect colour.
It's golden.

374
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And I think the custard looks
beautifully set.

375
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The flavour's beautiful.

376
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry is fantastic as well,
'cause it's flaky.

377
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's delicious because
you've got lots and lots of citrus.

378
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Okay.

379
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you getting the blueberry?

380
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've just had a mouthful of blueberry
and didn't get anything.

381
00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think blueberries have much taste.

382
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] It's a shame.
-Okay.

383
00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sugar top hasn't quite worked
like a crème brûlée.

384
00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But nice idea,
and they do look very neat though.

385
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

386
00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Erm, they look quite neat.
-[Henry] Mm-hmm.

387
00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very thick, that base.

388
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, there's more base
than there is filling.

389
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

390
00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Your flavour of the custard's good.

391
00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a lovely zing of...

392
00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Of zest.
-The flavour's okay?

393
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's good. It's overbaked
because there's so little of it.

394
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is Helena all over, isn't it?

395
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] It's amazing.

396
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think the design is incredible.

397
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] What a colour.

398
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got lavender, so I thought
I could get away with purple.

399
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That is so much. Too much lavender.
-[Helena] Oh, really?

400
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a little bit soapy.
-Okay.

401
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not bad.
It's not brilliant, but it's not bad.

402
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I'll take that, Paul.

403
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I did have an accident.

404
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] You've lost one of them.
-Yeah.

405
00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's down there. You can...
-[all chuckling]

406
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] These are incredible.

407
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, they're absolutely exquisite,
the jelly that you've injected.

408
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Was the plan that these
would have looked like that on top?

409
00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosie] Yeah, they were on top.

410
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And they melted. [chuckles]

411
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It looks a bit sad on the top
'cause it's not finished.

412
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pastry's quite damp. It isn't crisp.

413
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The matcha sort of does come through.

414
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not one of my favourite flavours,
matcha, but, erm...

415
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fair enough.

416
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I love the blackberry.
I love that flavour.

417
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flavour of the custard is delicious.

418
00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

419
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am never making a custard pie again, no.

420
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I despise pastry. I despise custard.

421
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That could have gone better.
The pastry, Paul said it was thick.

422
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It felt thick when I was rolling it out,

423
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I thought,
"I haven't got time to roll it thinner."

424
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Should have done that.

425
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah!

426
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got a handshake.

427
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
1920s has been all right so far,
but there's still two challenges.

428
00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The Technical will be a disaster.

429
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just always is. [chuckles]

430
00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>With only mystery ingredients</i>
<i>and a deep fat fryer as a hint,</i>

431
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>the bakers can only guess</i>

432
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>what fate awaits them</i>
<i>in the Technical Challenge.</i>

433
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right, my lovely bakers,
time for your Technical Challenge,

434
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which today has been set for you
by Prue. Any words of advice?

435
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. There are four basic skills
needed for this challenge,

436
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but you need to get them all right.

437
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, as ever,
this challenge will be judged blind,

438
00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so we're gonna have to ask
you two lovelies to leave the tent.

439
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Off you pop.

440
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are they up to today?

441
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think they've gone fracking.

442
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, I need to have a chat with them.

443
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. Today, Prue would like you to make
18 beignets soufflés.

444
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's that?

445
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Noel.
-I've got nothing.

446
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, basically, it's a fried choux ball
filled with a smooth raspberry jam.

447
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs to be crispy on the outside,
and light and fluffy on the inside.

448
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm imagining they need to be uniform
in size and shape.

449
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yep. Served with... a sabayon.

450
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Sabayon.
-[Sandi] Yeah.

451
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

452
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I mean, what is a...
-Soufflé.

453
00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-...without a...
-Sabayon?

454
00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, you've got an hour and a half.

455
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks...
-Get set...

456
00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake.

457
00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[groans]

458
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michelle] I have never heard of it
in my life.

459
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know what it is.

460
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I assume it's like profiteroles, kind of.

461
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's literally six instructions.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.

462
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prue, beignets soufflés.

463
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It is 1920s week,
and these were very popular then.

464
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They should all know how to make
choux pastry,

465
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so that shouldn't be
too much of a problem.

466
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I reckon most of them wouldn't have
fried choux pastry before.

467
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Because you usually bake choux.
-[Paul] You normally bake choux.

468
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the most difficult thing is

469
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
how are you going to get it into
perfect balls and drop it in the fat?

470
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the best way to do it
is to do it with two spoons.

471
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The quenelle.
-Yeah, but try and get it round

472
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
rather than quenelle-shaped.

473
00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] So, what do we expect to see
inside this?

474
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Lots of air, and some soft,
almost stretchy dough.

475
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just wanna see what it's like
with the sabayon as well.

476
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They're delicious, and the jam
gives that nice richness to it.

477
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice and smooth,

478
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the sabayon, it's like a little cloud

479
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which carries
a little bit of flavour to it as well.

480
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just hope we get some fantastic, light,
airy beignets soufflés in the tent.

481
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With a perfect sabayon.

482
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not much to ask, is it?
-[chuckles]

483
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
"For the beignets batter,
make pâte à choux."

484
00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the hell is a "pâte à choux"?

485
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I assume it's choux pastry.

486
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michael] Choux pastry,
I made once upon a time,

487
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I've kind of forgotten everything.

488
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] I think I might just
literally chuck everything in

489
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and see what happens.

490
00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've got all the measurements,
it's just how they go in.

491
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm melting the butter in the water,
'cause I feel like that's right.

492
00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then I'm getting ready
to shoot the flour in and beat a lot.

493
00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not entirely sure
why I need to shoot it in,

494
00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I remember hearing that.

495
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Henry] From what I remember with choux,
I've got to cook off the moisture

496
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and this should come cleanly away
from the side of the pan.

497
00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This looks fine,
but I know I've got to add the eggs.

498
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm concerned if I put them in now,
will they scramble?

499
00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I don't know when to put them in.

500
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michael] Not while it's hot,
'cause that'll cook the eggs.

501
00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe it needs to cook the eggs. I just...

502
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry] I'm adding the egg bit by bit.

503
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't wanna shock it
or add all the moisture in one go.

504
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How happy was your face?
Beignets soufflés, sabayon.

505
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keep doing the smiley face.

506
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, what? Really?

507
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, it's just not, like,
looking like a choux should look.

508
00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. What should it look like?

509
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It should drop.

510
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it's so...

511
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, it's dropping,
but it's not dropping nicely.

512
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Helena] I think this is
what it's meant to look like.

513
00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's pipeable, but it's, like...
It's runny.

514
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A little bit more in.
Let's see what that does.

515
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] I might just
take it off the heat now.

516
00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe let it sit for a bit?

517
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have no idea.

518
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. "Three. Working in batches

519
00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and piping directly onto
an oiled dessert spoon,

520
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
pipe 18 round balls of choux
and carefully drop into the oil and fry."

521
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Obvious.

522
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Deep fat fryer on 190.

523
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna try and pipe my choux
and just hope for the best,

524
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but this feels quite runny.

525
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] This looks lovely, doesn't it?

526
00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michelle] How the hell
do you make a ball out of them?

527
00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just gonna put a bit of dough in.

528
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go.

529
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gone straight to the bottom.

530
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] Come on, float, float, float.

531
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Blow up, get crispy and float.

532
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ooh. I mean, it's puffed
into something, hasn't it?

533
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] Why won't it flip over?

534
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that really hot, that fat?
-[Rosie] Oh!

535
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Watch your face.
-It's 190 degrees.

536
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This could be like a <i>Face/Off</i> thing.
Have you seen that film?

537
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where our faces get burnt
and we have to swap our faces.

538
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I have to become a vet
and you have to go and do stand-up.

539
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How would you feel about that?

540
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think your audiences will be
a little disappointed.

541
00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think there are some angry stallions

542
00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
getting pretty riled as I put
the wrong hands up their bums.

543
00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The wrong hands?
How can you put the wrong hands?

544
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, is it either hand?

545
00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Surely if the horse--
-You've gotta be an ambidextrous rectaler.

546
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That could be a ball, you know?

547
00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know how people are making balls.
This needs to be round.

548
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Almost wanna, like, cut one open and
just see what the hell is going on inside.

549
00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's it meant to be like again?

550
00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.

551
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's disgusting.

552
00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's totally raw in the middle.

553
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michael] I'm gonna remake the choux,
to make it stiffer.

554
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe I didn't whisk it enough.

555
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. Interesting.

556
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] Time for a time call.
-I've got this.

557
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't worry.
-Halfway through.

558
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you are halfway through!
Halfway through!

559
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even without batteries,
these are working brilliantly.

560
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michael] I'm gonna make
the choux pastry again.

561
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs to be stiffer,
but I don't know how.

562
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] I'm starting my pastry again.

563
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The problem is that
I don't know how to make choux.

564
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the basic problem.

565
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How many am I meant to make, 18?

566
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] I seem to be getting
a technique here.

567
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The choux is just not stiff enough
to pipe.

568
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See, it's runny again.

569
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is embarrassing.

570
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Second batch looks the same
as the first one.

571
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That one looks like a round one.
The rest don't.

572
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] Mine are burnt.

573
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michael] It's too soft.
I know it's too soft.

574
00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See, it just doesn't hold together.

575
00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At this point, I don't think
I'm gonna have anything to present.

576
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Michael, you okay?
-[Michael] I'm freaking out.

577
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm finding it really hard.

578
00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keep going. Keep going, Michael.

579
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[breathing heavily]

580
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[whispering] Come on, come on, come on.
Please, please, please.

581
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[breathing heavily]

582
00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have half an hour left,
half an hour.

583
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[whispering] I can't...
I can't do it anymore.

584
00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry] These aren't looking too shabby.

585
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're deflating now.
I don't think I can do this anymore.

586
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why don't you get those two out,

587
00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
have a little quick walk for five minutes,
then come back?

588
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I need to keep going. [sniffles]
Otherwise I'll stop.

589
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] You're doing really well.
You're good at this.

590
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckling]
-Imagine me doing this. I've got nothing.

591
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michael sniffles]

592
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're nearly there.

593
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can do this.

594
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm happy with the balls.
Better than David's, that's for sure.

595
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look like Scotch eggs.

596
00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry] ...11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16... 18.

597
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've got 18 things.

598
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm wondering
whether to get the jam on.

599
00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nothing on the instructions,
just "make a jam".

600
00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna chuck in the berries
and the sugar together.

601
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've not stopped...

602
00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that's really good.

603
00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anything at this point, I've won.

604
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Priya] I'm getting there.

605
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, jam is looking jammy.

606
00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're going pips out

607
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause we were asked for smooth jam.

608
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I'm making jam. Let's see
if I can get something to present.

609
00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] Bakers...
-You have 15 minutes left!

610
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna make the sabayon.

611
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is a sabayon?

612
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna assume a sabayon is a custard.

613
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Caster sugar, egg yolks,

614
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and... marsala."
-Ooh!

615
00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm thinking whisk the egg and sugar

[Henry] It's raw egg yolks,
so I've got to somehow cook it.

617
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This might be
the best way to do it.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm guessing it's gotta be
quite thick to dip in.

619
00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am gonna get this to ribbon stage,
and then I'll put some of this in.

620
00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

623
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Oh! That's all right. [chuckles]

625

-You have five minutes left.

626
00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to pipe jam into these bad boys.

627
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

644
00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, everybody,
up to the table, please.

650
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] They look good, the balls.

651
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They're all fairly round,

-[Paul] The structure's there.
-[Prue] Yes.

654
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

655
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is a very interesting sauce,

656
00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it's not what we asked for.

657
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] These are interesting.

-Yeah, the colour's okay.

659
00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Very good jam,
but too doughy inside.

660
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How's the sabayon?
-It's got the flavour of it.

661
00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not quite there on the texture.
It needs to be much fluffier.

662
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Moving on. Now these, way too dark.

663
00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] They're fairly even.

664
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The texture inside is pretty good.

665
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. They're nice and light.

666
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The sabayon's split as well.

667
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now moving on.

668
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got a few issues.

669
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're more like blinis, aren't they?
-[Prue] Yeah.

670
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no volume in the choux.

671
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Although, the sabayon...

672
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Looks very, very good.

673
00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Taste good?
-Yeah, it is good.

674
00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These are round, aren't they?

675
00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And their colour's not bad,
it's a little dark.

676
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are cooked inside,
though, these beignets.

677
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A little bit too much jam.

678
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But they taste okay, and they are baked
all the way through.

679
00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unfortunately, the sabayon
is just not whisked enough.

680
00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah. It's split really badly.

681
00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These beignets, you've gone
from the sublime to the ridiculous.

682
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm. I wouldn't call that sublime,

683
00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but it's...
-[Paul] But it's sublime-ish...

684
00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both] ...compared to that.

685
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] They seem all baked through.

686
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

687
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Too much jam.

688
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] The sabayon's flavour's okay.
-[Prue] Right. This is not a happy sight.

689
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's like a churros

690
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-that hasn't opened up slightly.
-[Prue chuckles] Yes.

691
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue] Yeah.

692
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] And that is not a sabayon.

693
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now these don't look too bad.

694
00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both] They're a nice colour.

695
00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope, when you cut into it,

696
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that we see a nice aeration inside,
which we do.

697
00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Not too much jam.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Yeah, it's a bit thin.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

A variety of different colours here.

-[Prue] They look really nicely done.

704
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've gotta put that on there and I just
don't know how stable it is at the moment.

1028
00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoa. Fuck, that was close.

1029
00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1030
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's so near the edge.

1031
00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Christ.

1032
00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a mess.

1033
00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At the moment, I feel like the fear
is making me very... ooh, sloppy.

1034
00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Priya exhales] This is a hot job.
-[Michelle] God, I've got such a sweat on.

1037
00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] It's so hot in here.
Buttercream is melting.

1038
00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Helena] I'm shaking.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You seem very calm.
-Yeah, well...

1040
00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't really get flustered, do you?
You know it's gonna be fine.

1041
00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if they're not,
then you can't change it, can you?

1042
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wow. You're like the Dalai Lama.
-[laughs]

1043
00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need to chat to Michael. Bless him.
Is he all right today?

1044
00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] He's very quiet today.

1045
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's silenced the screaming

1046
00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's what I do.
-Yeah. Definitely.

1047
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the first tiered cake
I've made in my life.

1048
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And possibly the last.

1049
00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Noel] You have...

1050
00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Left.

1052
00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel some pressure in this
'cause it's about decoration.

1053
00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has to look spectacular.

1054
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've done it better than this
but I'm happy that I'm getting there.

1055
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just gonna, like, remind myself
I do actually enjoy this.

1056
00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1057
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Steph] Henry, do you need any help?

1058
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm having triangular misbehaviour
over here.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do you want me to move these?
-Could you? This is...

1060
00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want a place reserved in heaven for you.

1061
00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know I like decoration.

1062
00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Priya] It's stained glass
so it's supposed to be a bit rough.

1063
00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just doing extra things now.

1064
00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Any chance I might have had
of surviving is gone.

1065
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your time is up. Place your Showstoppers
at the end of your benches.

1066
00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, done.
I think less is more, isn't it?

1067
00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yours looks beautiful. Like, really cool.

1068
00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why the hell did I do that?

1069
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's time for the Prohibition Era cakes
to face the judgment of Paul and Prue.

1070
00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must say, Michael, it's really neat.

1071
00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's original. Nicely done.

1072
00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's stark because
you've got the blackberries

1073
00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with the black icing. It's really unusual.

1074
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your piping's really good.
It's pretty accurate.

1075
00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales sharply]

1076
00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know you had this idea that
you'd have the drizzle running down

1077
00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-like you do in the drink.
-Yeah.

1078
00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It sort of hasn't worked.
It looks like a smudge.

1079
00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the lemon. The sponge is good.

1080
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'd have loved to have
that fruit coming through,

1081
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that sharpness coming through.
You may have got the colour,

1082
00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but you certainly haven't got the flavour.

1083
00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-Nice cake, though.

1084
00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1085
00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, it's such a mixture

1086
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-of sinister and very pretty.
-[laughing]

1087
00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's me. [laughing]

1088
00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't like the outside of it,
and I tell you why.

1089
00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why?
-The piping work is not good.

1090
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, let's have a look inside.

1091
00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's a red cake.
-[laughs] It is.

1092
00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a bit bland inside.
-Bland?

1093
00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah. It's quite dry.
-[Prue] You get the vodka.

1094
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't get much raspberry.

1095
00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I find it a pleasant cake.

1096
00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you shut your eyes,
it's a nice sponge cake.

1097
00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks, Prue. [chuckles]

1098
00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's quite an elegant-looking cake.
-It looks really dramatic.

1099
00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And very '20s. I like that.

1100
00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely flavour. Really good flavour.

1101
00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think it's a little dry.
-[Henry] Mm-hmm.

1102
00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes, it's a bit dry.
-Okay.

1103
00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the design, structure,
and flavour is very good.

1104
00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1105
00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's one of the most interesting
looking cakes I've seen for a long time.

1106
00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That took a bit of getting through.

1107
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the ganache. I wanted it really firm
so I could crumb coat it.

1108
00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. Wow.

1109
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's not a ganache,
that's a bar of chocolate.

1110
00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can certainly taste the alcohol.

1111
00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the sponge inside.
The flavours are beautiful.

1112
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My biggest complaint is the thickness
of the outside of the cake.

1113
00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-I think it's a really good cake,

1114
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but you know it's not perfect.

1115
00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1116
00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the sort of naked cake look.

1117
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are they meant to be
dropped into each other?

1118
00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-[Prue laughs]

1119
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Could have got away with that, David.
-I know. Definitely weren't.

1120
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, it's fine. Nice and lemony.

1121
00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Good strong flavour.
-The buttercream's quite grainy.

1122
00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I don't like that in a buttercream.

1123
00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It should be absolutely silky-smooth.

1124
00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the sponge is baked well
and I like the lemon.

1125
00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Close up, it does look a bit of a mess.

1126
00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the drawing on here is not good.

1127
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It could be a lot neater than that.

1128
00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's some really big
pieces of pineapple in here.

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavour's nice, I just think
the pieces are a little bit clumsy.

1130
00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a really good cake.
It could be fantastic.

1131
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Yeah.

1132
00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the decoration has been rushed.
It needs to be much more vibrant.

1133
00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1134
00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite a delicate flavour. Very nice.

1135
00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd like perhaps
a little more passion fruit.

1136
00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Overall, the cake's nice.
-Yeah.

1137
00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But your fondant on the outside's
a bit too thick.

1138
00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1139
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you're thinking of piña colada
as a cake, I think you've got one.

1140
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-And it tells you what's in there.

1141
00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Piña colada.

1142
00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's see how it tastes.
-Hmm.

1143
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. That just dropped through.

1144
00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that good or bad?
-[whispers] I don't know.

1145
00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That looks really appetising.
I like the different colours.

1146
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I love the lime sponges.
-They're delicious.

1147
00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never had anything like it.
That's a first for me.

1148
00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And it works.
-It's really good.

1149
00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Clever.

1150
00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, Steph.

1151
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Michelle, I think this...

1152
00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
decoration, the way you've tackled it,
is really interesting,

1153
00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it's actually quite pretty.

1154
00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I think you've overthought it.

1155
00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are too many concepts.
That doesn't go with that,

1156
00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and that doesn't go with that.
-Let's have a look inside.

1157
00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sponges are nice and equal.

1158
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They look a nice texture.
-Yeah.

1159
00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got shavings and flakiness
of coconut in there,

1160
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-which don't work in a cake.
-Okay.

1161
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I think that cake's slightly too dry.

1162
00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're getting a lack of flavour.

1163
00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A smaller cake with
more of the pineapple in,

1164
00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with none of the coconut.

1165
00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'd end up with a cake
that's slightly shorter

1166
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but full of flavour all the way through.

1167
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It couldn't get any worse, could it?
I had a roasting.

1168
00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:44.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like I've been told off
by teachers from school.

1169
00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, Prue said this morning,
"I hope you pull off, you need to."

1170
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then she said to me, "Not perfect."

1171
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Priya] I, so badly,
wanna stay for another week,

1172
00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but might be the end of
the little dream for me. Who knows?

1173
00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Every week, I've nailed the Showstopper,
it's what saved me.

1174
00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This week that I don't nail it,
thankfully, I came top

1175
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
on the Technical,
did okay in the Signature.

1176
00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gee, I hope that's enough.

1177
00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's go through the top of the pack,
the ones that you really liked.

1178
00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Steph is looking good.
-Steph's looking good.

1179
00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] <i>Steph has been</i>
<i>a very consistent baker.</i>

1180
00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She had a good week.
-The lime knocked you out.

1181
00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Henry...

1182
00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Henry did a decent job.
-His flavours were really good.

1183
00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] <i>I liked--</i>
<i>It was quite an elegant cake.</i>

1184
00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Henry normally misses that slightly.

1185
00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-David's you liked?
-It was a great decoration.

1186
00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very well thought through, very artistic.
And he did back that style up

1187
00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-with a little bit of substance.
-Yeah.

1188
00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who might we be saying goodbye to?

1189
00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wow. There's quite a lot to be honest.
-There's an awful lot.

1190
00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you're looking at Michelle,
Helena, Priya, Rosie.

1191
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But on this point, I think, when you
look over the three challenges closely,

1192
00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think there are two people
that are beginning to fall away.

1193
00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1194
00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well done, bakers, for getting
through the Roaring Twenties.

1195
00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, fortunately,
I've got the wonderful job

1196
00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of announcing the person
who's won Star Baker.

1197
00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The person who's won
Star Baker this week is...

1198
00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Steph.

1199
00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[applauding]

1200
00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:38.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Again!

1201
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, that means I have the horrible job
of sending home, I'm afraid,

1202
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-two of you this week.
-Okay.

1203
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the two people
who are going home are...

1204
00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:03.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Michelle and Helena. I'm so sorry.
-Oh, Helena.

1205
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

1206
00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh.
-Well, at least we go together.

1207
00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
-It's all right.

1208
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No surprise, was it? To be fair.

1209
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, darling.

1210
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm so happy getting to week five.
I never thought I'd get here,

1211
00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so to be here, to get Star Baker,
and to leave on week five, perfect.

1212
00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm bringing the geode cake to<i> Extra Slice</i>
'cause I love it.

1213
00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the fault line.

1214
00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've loved it. It's been fun.

1215
00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's been emotional. It's been emotional.

1216

1217
00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Friends for life, yes.

1218
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What? What's happening here?
-I'm sorry we got rid of your sister.

1219
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Family. Brutal.

1220
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm actually okay about it.
I've had an amazing time.

1221
00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've learned that I can take criticism,
I can have a laugh with it.

1222
00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And take the positives out of everything,
which hopefully I'll carry on doing.

1223
00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I definitely feel like I've dodged
the biggest bullet in the world.

1224

[Priya] I was ready to, like,
hold hands together and skip out.

1226
00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought I was going.
I'd accepted it, I'd moved on,

1227
00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd come to terms with it
and now it's like, what?

1228
00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't understand.

1229
00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I did nearly go.
