00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
and she said it's her dream to enter.

307
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
So I said, "Let's do it."

308
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She wasn't very confident
that she would have the skills to do it,

309
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I knew deep down inside
she had this passion

310
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it's been unleashed.

311
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What does it mean for me to be here?

312
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It means…

313
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have you ever get something you dream of,

314
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you don't think you'll get it,
and eventually you get it?

315
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like a lottery jackpot. [laughing]

316
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you have to work hard for it.

317
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am absolutely so proud
of her for getting this far.

318
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm the proudest boyfee ever.

319
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckling]

320
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never been the top person
in any kind of competition

321
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or any classes that I've attended,

322
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so maybe baking is my hidden talent

323
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that I never discover until recently.

324
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So Bradley said to me, "You're already
a winner to be in the final."

325
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Just go and smash it." [laughs]

326
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that an egg on the floor?
-Yeah, I just laid them.

327
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

328
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's a woman of many talents.

329
00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] Cake is done.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, going in.

333
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Time is very short.
We have to make a lot of things.

334
00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need to assemble my cake

335
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Haven't done the broad beans just yet.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm all right. I'm not panicking.

338
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

339
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have half an hour left
before the judges crush your dreams.

340
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

342

344
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, my God. Cutting this thing
is harder than I thought.

345
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] So this is the egg cress.
Want a taste?

346
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, it's not--
-Not an egg cress guy?

347
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not an egg and cress guy, no.

348
00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have the eating age of a nine-year-old.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

350
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro laughs]

351
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] This is salsa verde.

352
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is basically
very random sandwich I would say.

353
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going back to my old story
of, er, panicking at the very end,

354
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I will start doing that
in about another ten minutes. [chuckles]

355
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Going in is my biscuits that I don't need.

356
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] So I'm assembling the Swiss rolls.

357
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] So this is the rosemary cream.

358
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rosemary goes well
with elderflower and strawberry.

359
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] So this is
the cream cheese filling.

360
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

362
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not sure these are baked properly.

363
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] It's not perfect.
Some are a bit wonky.

364
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] They're looking good.

365
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] Gonna start rushing now.

366
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

367
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

372

373
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dude, again… You have a feast, man.

374
00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do you do this, man?

375
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's the final signature.
-The last signature is done.

377
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Syabira sighs]

378
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] We don't have to worry
about signatures again.

379
00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>It's judgement time</i>
<i>for the bakers' final signature challenge.</i>

380

381
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Hi, Abdul.

382
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I think overall it looks quite nice.

383
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The Swiss rolls have lost colour.

384
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sandwiches are a little bit
irregular in size.

385
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're a bit thick as well.
Thinner would have been better.

386
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The finger sandwiches
are grated beetroot, carrot.

387
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cream cheese
is filled with dill and chive.

388
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I like the dill. It's just
the right amount of cream cheese.

389
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Beetroot, carrot, nice and crunchy.

390
00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cream cheese works well
with a nice, soft sandwich.

391
00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] So far so good.
Now we need the pie.

392
00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is leek, onion,
with Yorkshire Fettle.

393
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is also mint in there.

394
00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The herb content in there,
it's got a nice kick.

395
00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's delicious.

396
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I must say, your pastry is lovely.

397
00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Let's look at your Swiss roll.

398
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm.

399
00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cherries work well with it.

400
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not getting much tarragon kicking in.
-Okay.

401
00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overall, a decent job.
Your flavours are all good.

403
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I must say, it does absolutely look
very cornucopia overflowing.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Go on. Turn it into an elegant
finger sandwich, Mr Hollywood.

406
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] There you go.

407
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Mmm, heaven.
-Oh, good. [chuckles]

408
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Can't go wrong with egg and cress.

409
00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm, gives it just a little kick.
It's really nice.

411
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My pies are cauliflower cheese pies.

412
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It looks undercooked.
-[Sandro] Very undercooked.

413
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flavour of the cauliflower cheese
is delicious.

414
00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the pastry's not quite cooked.

415
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's look at your massive cake.

416
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I made lemon and elderflower sponges
with a mixed berry compote inside.

417
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got a cream cheese filling.

418
00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Great flavours.

419
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The fruit filling, it's got tartness.
It works beautifully with the lemon.

420
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cream cheese is beautiful.

421
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I just think it's a little too big.
-Too big, yeah.

422
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I won't try the tart, but it looks nice.
-Thank you.

423
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want to cheers to your last
signature judgement for me?

424
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Cheers.
-[Prue] I'll tell you what.

425
00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've probably made a mistake
'cause you're putting me in a good mood

426
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-for judging Syabira.
-[laughter]

427
00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Give us it back.
-[all laughing]

428
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It reminds me a lot of the hotel business

429
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because in the hotel business,
everything has to be the same size

430
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and they look very similar.
-[Prue] Yeah.

431
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay, let's check your sandwiches.

432
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is broad bean coriander
paste with salsa verde.

433
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's gonna say he's never had
those flavours before in a sandwich.

434
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's right. It's unusual.
It's really delicious.

435
00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got exactly the right texture.

436
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Pies are very neat. Quite robust.

437
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Isn't that beautiful?
-Well done.

438
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The egg is in the middle.

439
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it needed
a little more salt in it.

440
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the pastry is delicious.

441
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Swiss roll.

442
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very nice. I like that decoration.

443
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Explain what this is again.

444
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is elderflower sponge
with strawberry and rosemary cream.

445
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very interesting.
I think the rosemary slightly overpowers.

446
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Prue's right.
But the sponge is beautifully baked.

447
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's soft, melts in the mouth,
goes well with the filling.

448
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Well done.
-[Paul] Thank you.

449
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

450
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue always said
my flavours are unusual. [laughing]

451
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've heard that every week, which is fine.

452
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think they mean it in a very good way.

453
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It mostly went to plan.

454
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They didn't taste all the elements,
but I'm feeling super relieved.

455
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm ready for the technical.

456
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abdul] Yeah, with technicals
for the finale, it's tough to say.

457
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just hope there are some instructions.

458
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles softly]

459
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>As ever, the bakers have no idea</i>
<i>what they're about to face.</i>

460
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, it's time for your final
technical challenge,

461
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which today has been set
by Paul Hollywood.

462
00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, any advice?

463
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You only get one shot at this.

464
00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Try not to mess it up.

465
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Thank you, Paul.

466
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now Paul is very emotional
because obviously the show is ending,

467
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so he's written a little song
that he'd like to sing for you.

468
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Over to you, Paul.

469
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it was really good.

470
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure he'll sing it later.
He's just a bit shy.

471
00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As ever, we ask, er,
both judges to leave the tent.

472
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Er, Paul's already gone,
so, Prue, if you'd like to hop it.

473
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For your technical challenge,

474
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the judges would like you to make
a summer pudding bombe.

475
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your bombe should consist
of an elderflower and berry jelly,

476
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
creamy meringue and raspberry filling,
all encased in a raspberry-soaked bread.

477
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you have just two hours.

478
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On your marks, get set, bake.

479
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never made anything like this at all.

480
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never heard of, like,
a summer pudding bombe before.

481
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] No instructions as always.

482
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] No idea.

483
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, this is the most beautiful thing.

484
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a bombe, is it?
-Essentially, it's a summer pudding.

485
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So as you cut into this,
you get the bread that's been soaked

486
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
on the outside with raspberry syrup.
Er, inside, you have a mousse-like mixture

487
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and right in the heart of it
is an elderflower strawberry jelly.

488
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now this is the killer thing.
The loaf they made this morning,

489
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they're gonna use that loaf to make this.

490
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Now where can they go wrong?
-Plenty of places.

491
00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rectangular strips going
all around is the only way

492
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you can seal in the mousse inside.

493
00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You use any other shape,
you'll create holes and it'll pour out.

494
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And also, they're being asked
to use vegetable gelatine.

495
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With vegetable gelatine,
you have to boil it to get it to work.

496
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If they just throw it into hot water,

497
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-it will not work and it will not set.
-Yeah, yeah.

498
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If this doesn't set,
it will just sink like a splodge.

499
00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is heaven in a spoon.

500
00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I can't stop eating this.
We have three to try.

501
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-And are they going to set?

502
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the question.

503
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] I'll start with the syrup.

504
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] Fifty gram caster sugar.
Fresh raspberries.

505
00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll bring it to a boil, make sure
all the raspberries have been crushed.

506
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Then I'll sieve it.
-[Matt] Do you like raspberry?

507
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Er, yeah. I like raspberry.
-Where is it on the list of berries?

508
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Top, like, two.
-Top two?

509
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I only know a few berries.

510
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I know strawberries. I know raspberries.
-Yeah.

511
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You know Chuck Berry?
-Chuck Berry. Don't know him.

512
00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You know Nick Berry?

-[Matt] Before your time.
-[laughing]

515
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the next part
is the jelly centre itself,

516
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is 100 ml of syrup,
100 gram of strawberries.

517
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where's the gelatine?

518
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Vegetarian gelatine powder.

519
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>Unlike its alternative,</i>
<i>vegetarian gelatine</i>

520

<i>needs a high heat to work.</i>

521
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] Shouldn't this be bloomed?

522
00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Typically with gelatine powder,
you need to bloom it.

523
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Vegetarian gelatine activates
at a higher temperature.

524
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs to be boiled to make sure
it's able to set. There's no other way.

525
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] I'm gonna bloom it in here.

526
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mix it in, let it sit there.

527
00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am following instructions,
because when I don't, things go wrong.

528
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gonna be frozen till it's set.

529
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] So this has to go
in the freezer.

530
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right. What's next?

531
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mini meringue kisses, it's probably
just a normal French meringue.

532
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] Eighty gram of icing sugar.

533
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wanna get stiff peaks.

534
00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need to pipe them,
it needs to be kisses,

535
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it needs to have a… [clicks tongue]

536
00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mini kisses, they said.
So I guess it has to be very small.

537
00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] There's a lot
of love on this tray.

538
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kisses, kisses, kisses, kisses.

539
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And now, gonna bake until
they become crispy on the outside,

540
00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they need to remain
a bit chewy on the inside.

541
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, 120 degrees.

542
00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way. No way!

543
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You are halfway through
the challenge! No way!

544
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] Small white loaf,
thinly sliced into 12.

545
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know that bread.

546
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-There you go.

547
00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello, old friend. You look familiar.

548
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] Luckily I baked it well.

549
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] Gonna do circles all around.
That's the best to do.

550
00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs] I don't want them
to see what I'm doing.

551
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's getting competitive.

552
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you using this slice?

553
00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I'm not. You wanna taste?

554
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I just wanted to do
what Paul does with bread.

555
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

556
00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[mimics Paul] It's under-proved,
but it's over-proved.

557
00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yeah, that's a good eat.

558
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

559
00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"All of this dessert has to be encased

560
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gonna start soaking my breads.

561
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't have enough juice to soak this.

562
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not sure if this has to be this wet.

563
00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just light soaking, 'cause if it's very
highly soaked, it's gonna break apart.

564
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] The syrup is finished.
How is that possible?

565
00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe I'll just put too much
on these ones,

566
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just gonna spread them.
[laughs] There we go.

567
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

You've got half an hour left.

568
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So stop all this horseplay and get baking.

569
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pâté à bombe?

570
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

what is pâté à bombe.

two teaspoons of gelatine powder

573
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] I think this might
be the trifle custard,

574
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's just in a posh way
of saying you're making pâté à bombe.

575
00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abdul] I'm gonna take the sugar syrup
and then pour it over the egg yolks.

576
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] I'm mixing the pâté à bombe
with the whipping cream.

577
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here's the pâté à bombe.

578
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] It is actually quite liquidy.

579
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] That's done.

580
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mini meringue kisses.

581
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

586
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Considering there's less than
half an hour left in this technical,

587
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
this is a very calm tent.

588
00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Er, the problem is, er, it won't be calm
when we flip over our pudding bombes.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

742
00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

748
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It could be the planet itself,
it could be the sea,

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

750
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Four and a half hours will go
real quickly for the bakers,

751
00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so initially, get all the bakes done
and then start to assemble,

752
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to make it look incredible.

753
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

859
00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Starting with Syabira.
Some great flavours going on.

860
00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] Tarragon. Not a common
ingredient people put in a biscuit.

861
00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But to have a vanilla, it's too plain.

862
00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

863
00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn't believe
that these flavours could work.

864
00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-But I've learned to trust Syabira.

865
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Abdul's ideas are fantastic.

866
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's got honey that's going to be
quite an overwhelming flavour.

867
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The thing I think's so good about Abdul,

868
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is he does really classic flavours,
but somehow they're never boring.

869
00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

who's been a bit haphazard.

870
00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're not baked,
I think I had the heat too high.

871
00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's browned too much.
Can't do nothing, it has to bake.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

873
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not that he doesn't have the skills, just
that he's always in a rush at the end.

874
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it'll make
for a fascinating challenge now,

876
00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

877
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I'm just dreading them
being impossible to judge.

878
00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we'll end up having to toss a coin.

879
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Sandro] Starting the profiteroles,
then my fillings,

881
00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
bread rolls, biscuits… [whistles]

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These are thick craquelins,

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I think they will not allow
the choux pastry to rise.

884
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:15.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But at least I have quite a few others,
so it should be okay.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

898
00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

899
00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The craquelin was too thick
so it's just caused them to flatten out.

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:54.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

from the beginning,

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not over-sweet because the interior
is fruity, but not sweet.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1030
00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you could've done
a bit more work on the face.

1031
00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, it's a rather strange construction.

1032
00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. You can see what's happening here.
I love the colours. It's fantastic.

1033
00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, let's start with the sponge.

1034
00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So that's black pepper and blackberry jam.

1035
00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] And hazelnut
chocolate buttercream.

1036
00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I definitely think
there's too much buttercream.

1037
00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I quite like it. Tastes delicious.

1038
00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It actually works beautifully
with the blackberry in the sponge.

1039
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Shall we have a go at the second layer?
-Okay.

1040
00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's supposed to be tarragon shortbread.

1041
00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's the filling inside?
-It's blackberry buttercream.

1042
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is lovely shortbread.

1043
00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very buttery and very crisp.

1044
00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You told us about the tarragon,
but it isn't there. You can't taste it.

1045
00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Frankly, I'm glad.

1046
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because it's really delicious.

1047
00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, thank you.
-[Paul] Okay.

1048
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have gooseberry meringue

1049
00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and tart with rhubarb
and strawberry cream.

1050
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not the neatest thing I've seen,
but it tastes fantastic nevertheless.

1051
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your flavours are superb.
I expected, however,

1052
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to be a little bit neater.

1053
00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandro] Well done, Syabira.
-There we go.

1054
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Done it.
-[softly] Good luck.

1055
00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Abdul, would you
like to bring up your showstopper?

1056
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the colours.

1057
00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
From a distance, you go,
"That's attractive, I like the yellow."

1058
00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then you get closer.

1059
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-We'll start at the bottom with the cake.

1060
00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sponge is a honey sponge.

1061
00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In between each is blackberry jam,

1062
00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
some strawberries,
and Italian meringue buttercream.

1063
00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, you've got honey…

1064
00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Abdul] Yes.
-…ploughed all the way through that.

1065
00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not unpleasant.

1066
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I like that.
But it's a little bit too sweet.

1067
00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Abdul, if you thought about it,
you could've made them more bee-shaped.

1068
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Abdul] Definitely--
-This is the fattest bee.

1069
00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-[Paul] Tastes beautiful.

1070
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Slightly chewy on the inside,
crisp on the out,

1071
00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's just, you've got no dome.

1072
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, it just needed more time to rest
and a bit more height.

1073
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think
that the choux buns are the worst thing.

1074
00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. I tried to fill some at least,
but, yeah, they were just flat.

1075
00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's a proper failure.
-[Abdul] Yes, I agree.

1076
00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's look at your biscuit.

1077
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've done these before,

1078
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so we know exactly
what we're dealing with here.

1079
00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. I think that's a triumph.

1080
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's lovely. It's chewy,
crispy on the outside. How it should be.

1081
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That's really good.

1082
00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've had a few hiccups
with the macarons and the choux.

1083
00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do like the cake.
You've got nice flavour in there.

1084
00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Honey is certainly the overriding flavour.

1085
00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Noel and Matt] Well done.

1086
00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Whoo-whoo!

1087
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wish it would have gone much better.

1088
00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But regardless of the outcome,
there's going to be a party.

1089
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's my friends there.
I'm going to celebrate and enjoy.

1090
00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm very happy to be in the final,
and I'm very proud of it.

1091
00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I'm not a winner,

1092
00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm still happy for whoever wins.

1093
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They all deserve it.

1094
00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know. I'm keeping my hopes up.

1095
00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I feel like the person
least likely to get it would be me.

1096
00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

You do ask for lots of different bakes
and you got lots of different bakes.

1105
00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

quite a lot in the sense of the cake

1106
00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, I thought most of the flavours
were, as always with these three, perfect.

1109
00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Really good.

1110
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Abdul's been the most
consistent this year.

1111
00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Incredible flavours,
very focused on what he wants to do.

1112
00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Went a bit wayward today.

1113
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But is that enough to take
the prize away from him? I don't know.

1114
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Syabira, you know, she did mess up
on the tarts that sit on the top.

1115
00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They could've been much neater.

1116
00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought her flavours were spot on,
and, as always, quite unusual.

1117
00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Sandro overbaked his.

1118
00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1119
00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I agree with Paul
that the sponge was a little overbaked,

1120
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Paul] Yeah.

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
