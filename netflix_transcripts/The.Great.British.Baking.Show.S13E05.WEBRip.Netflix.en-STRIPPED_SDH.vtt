<c.bg_transparent>I think the chocolate cup</c.bg_transparent>

352
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>The cream would have made a difference,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>but it's all good.</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>So, we have got a dark chocolate cup</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>We have a ladyfinger biscuit</c.bg_transparent>

362
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Your chocolate mousse layer is so thin,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>it's almost like a ganache.</c.bg_transparent>

363
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>I think you missed the trick</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>They look quite interesting,</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>Okay.</c.bg_transparent>

367
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>It's a little bit all over the place.</c.bg_transparent>

368
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>My chocolate mousse cups</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>I think the strawberry mousse</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>is delicious, but it is a bit soft.</c.bg_transparent>

372
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Okay.</c.bg_transparent>

373
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>It's a bit like a fool,</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>And I think that the biscuit</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>should be crisper.</c.bg_transparent>

375
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-Just think it's all too soft.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-Okay.</c.bg_transparent>

376
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

<c.bg_transparent>The mousse is made from milk chocolate</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>I think it's a pity the mousse isn't set.</c.bg_transparent>

387

<c.bg_transparent>I think the balance with the sponge,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>the coffee,</c.bg_transparent>

388
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>the caramel</c.bg_transparent>

391
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Very clever.</c.bg_transparent>

392
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-Wow!</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-What about them?</c.bg_transparent>

393
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>We've got a coffee-soaked biscotti</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>And then that's all set</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>in a white chocolate</c.bg_transparent>

396

400
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>What it is is it's a balance</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>of the sweet and the bitter.</c.bg_transparent>

401
00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Even that chocolate</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>brings something to it as well.</c.bg_transparent>

402
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>So the whole thing together,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>it is exceptional.</c.bg_transparent>

403
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

<c.bg_transparent>That could be for sale in</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>a patisserie shop in the middle of Paris.</c.bg_transparent>

407
