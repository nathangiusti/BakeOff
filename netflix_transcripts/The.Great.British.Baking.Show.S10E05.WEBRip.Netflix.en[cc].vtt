00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it's a classic, a Christmas pudding.

55
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

57
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I'd also like to see sponges
I've never had before,

58
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with completely different flavours
or fruit inside.

of steam puddings is the moisture.

62
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

in a steamed pudding is a dry sponge.

for their steaming right.

64
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to test them halfway through.

65
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

66
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when they open them up,
to find that they're raw.

You are one clever baker.

309
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

310
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay.

311
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] I have lychee custard.

312
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Taro ice cream.
-Ice cream.

313
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Wow.

314
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at that.

315
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That ice cream is really fragrant.

316
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sensational. I've never had
anything like that.

317
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

318
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The watermelon essence in the pudding
is just too much for me, unfortunately.

319
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It tastes a bit fake.
-[Syabira] Hmm.

320
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've overkilled it with the essence.

321
00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I say that with a heavy heart.

322
00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I agree. I did put too much today.

323
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Decorated well.

324
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They certainly look Middle Eastern…
-[Abdul laughs]

325
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
…and very, very pretty.

326
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abdul] They have date and fig in them
and saffron pouring custard.

327
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Saffron and the caramel sauce
works beautifully well,

328
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the fig and date again works lovely.

329
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's moist and delicious
and they're light as anything.

330
00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thank you.

331
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cream's melted
'cause it's quite warm in the tent today,

332
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but good height to them.

333
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've made my version
of a sticky toffee pudding.

334
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've got pecans and dates.

335
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's moist but really sticky.

336
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is the perfect sticky toffee texture.

337
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] There's just enough nuts
to balance in there.

338
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ultimately, it's a great eat, well done.

339
00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Thank you
-[Paul] Thank you.

340
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
They're a little uneven looking.
Some have more topping than others.

341
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-[Paul] What's in this?

342
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dawn] Orange and apple.

343
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Apple is nice and tart.

344
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The orange works
beautifully as well with it.

345
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, good.
-Well done.

346
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
So what is the booze?

347
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's coconut rum.

348
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] There, try it with the rum.

349
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've probably ruined it now.

350
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, you haven't.

351
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

352
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] It is caramelised pineapple
with coconut sponge.

353
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That coconut sponge,
it's a bit like, erm, tanning lotion.

354
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt and Prue] Explain that.

355
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tanning lotion I always associate,

356
00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
some tanning lotion
I use have a coconut smell.

357
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I see.

358
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like being on holiday
when you walk down the beach.

359
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got a coconut sponge
that's very sweet.

360
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's slightly overkill.

361
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These are clootie dumplings.

362
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So they're made
with fruit soaked in whiskey.

363
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're all misshapen. It looks messy.
-Yeah.

364
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the flavour.

365
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just think it would be
much better lighter.

366
00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's dried out.

367
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just too stodgy for me,
it's too dense, far too dense.

368
00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's the wrong recipe for this.
-Yeah.

369
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I know you said no more disasters,
but I think I've done this one in style.

370
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughter]

371
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think my water
in my steam bath was hot enough.

372
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll be kind and pick one
that's actually semi-done.

373
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carole] Yeah. [chuckles]

374
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is stem ginger with plum.

375
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does taste delicious.

376
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sharpness from the plums
really works as well.

377
00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just that the pudding
didn't get cooked.

378
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's heartbreaking.
-[Paul] Thank you.

379
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Thanks, Carole.

380
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look quite sweet. Glitzy on the top.

381
00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

382
00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] They look tempting.

383
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] I've made
apple and cherry crumble puddings.

384
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A bit of liqueur in there.

385
00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That looks like good sponge.

386
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The cherry and the apple
and with the custard as well,

387
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that blend of the spices
works beautifully well together.

388
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice.

389
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crumble's perfect, the custard's perfect.

390
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Think the cherry liqueur is perfect.
You've done a good job.

391
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, well done.
-Thank you.

392
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

393
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] Super pleased with the feedback.

394
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thought like the handshake was
almost gonna, uh… Never mind, next time.

395
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I agree that it was too dry.
So I kind of saw it coming.

396
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] Very mixed feelings,

397
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
just tad bit too much of
watermelon essence that brings me…

398
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fine.

399
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hate technicals. I really do.

400
00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] For your technical challenge,

415
00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue would like you each
to make a lemon meringue pie.

416
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] You have two hours.

417
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks…
-Get set…

418
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, go on then bake.

419
00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckling] Have you seen
the method, guys?

420
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carole] Oh, my gosh!

421
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Kevin] Come on.
-[Carole] There isn't any instruction.

422
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughter]

423
00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] No wonder she said
read the recipe carefully.

424
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It just says, "Make a lemon meringue pie."

425
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] The recipes before were decent.

426
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is like,
"What's the point?" [chuckles]

427
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Never made one before.
Don't know how I'm gonna survive this.

428
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue, so you've asked them to make
a lemon meringue pie without a method.

429
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, there's the pastry shells,
the lemon filling

430
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and there's the meringue.

431
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm quite sure they can do all three.
Why do they need a recipe?

432
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where do you think they'll go wrong?

433
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they don't blind bake,
they'll be in trouble.

434
00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get a soggy bottom.
-[Paul] Hmm.

435
00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] And if there are any cracks in it,

436
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when they pour that filling in,
it's going to run straight out.

437
00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What you want is a crisp meringue,

438
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but a soft sort of marshmallowy
but cooked middle.

439
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the lemon filling
is just soft, but firm.

440
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sharpness from the filling
with the sweetness in the meringue.

441
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's perfect. This is a classic bake.

442
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I really do expect
the bakers to all do well with it.

443
00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Totally agree.

444
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm starting with the pastry.
It's a shortcrust pastry.

445
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One egg beaten. Okay.

446
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carole] Don't wanna handle it
too much because it'll go too tough.

447
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've always done my shortcrust
in the KitchenAid

448
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I just know when to stop.

449
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A sweet shortcrust is sturdy, isn't it?

450
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is pretty sturdy.

451
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You make sure you don't roll it too cold.

452
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'Cause that's when it breaks.

453
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's what I'm talking about.
This guy knows, he knows his baking.

454
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

455
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] Syabira, are you a fan
of lemon meringue pie?

456
00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not really a huge fan
of the lemon meringue.

457
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Make something else? She's gonna have
seven lemon meringue pies to try.

458
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sweetcorn pie.
-Make a sweetcorn pie, yeah.

459
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kevin] I've brought my pastry together.

460
00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna let it rest
to let the gluten relax.

461
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Freezer.

462
00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lemon filling.

463
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So that's five lemons,
cornflour, orange juice,

464
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
caster sugar and egg yolks.

465
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It resembles a curd basically.

466
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Put everything in a saucepan,
keep whisking it.

467
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think everybody cooking the…
Yep, I'm gonna follow.

468
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is just beginning
to really thicken quickly.

469
00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope it's enough.

470
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If it isn't enough, I'm in trouble.

471
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Dawn, you must know
about lemon meringue.

472
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I have made quite a few.
-Made a few, right?

473
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're the sort of thing that I do
on a Sunday lunchtime.

474
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is where experience
in baking comes in.

475
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, that's great dough.

476
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Petty straightforward for me to make.

477
00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want the pastry to be
sort of even in thickness throughout.

478
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If it's too thin, it could crack.

479
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] It has to be properly inserted.

480
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

481
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will blind bake it
for around 15 minutes.

482
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] Blind baking,

483
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it sort of prebakes the bottom
so you don't have a soggy bottom.

484
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've always got a soggy bottom,
I have. [laughs]

485
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] Oh, people are blind baking.
I don't know if this is correct way to do.

486
00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna do the same.

487
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>Syabira might be worried</i>
<i>about her first ever lemon meringue pie…</i>

488
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh!

[Sandro] That's good.

If I was to get the Star Baker,
that would mean the world to me

493
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause it's like a proper validation that.

494
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you are halfway through.

495
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You ever seen me juggle?
It's pretty powerful.

[Janusz] I'm making the French meringue.

498
00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You whip your egg whites
and then start adding sugar bit by bit.

499
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

500
00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did it for a minute.

501
00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right. There you go.

502
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

503
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] Let's see what we can do.

504
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not as neat as I'd like it to be,
but it's fine.

505
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now they are blind baked,
I'll bake it a bit more.

506
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's underbaked,
it will just stay gloopy.

507
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It will not be crusty, you know, nice.

508
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't want to risk to overcook the base.

509
00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it should be partially cooked.

510

[Janusz] It looks cooked.
And it's started to brown.

512
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

there's nowhere near enough filling.

515
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm absolutely heartbroken about this.

516
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just going to have to go with it.

517
00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

524
00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hopefully, half an hour,
so it's crunchy on top and gooey inside.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Paul] Let's start with this one.
Looks neat.

574
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Pastry's a nice colour
and there's no leaking that I can see.

575
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the meringue's not bad.

577
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

579
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks as if the base cracked

581
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

582
00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the lemon, it's not too thick.

-No. It's very tart as well.

584
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just a pity about the crack.

585
00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is a mess. The pastry shell is
all over the place. That's falling apart.

586
00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

589
00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

and the pastry shell's not good.

590
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Moving on. That shell's a mess, isn't it?

598
00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just not neat, look how far
it's cracked. All the way around.

599
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

holes all over the place.

-[Paul] It's falling apart.

605
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Not enough blind baking.

609
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tart enough,
but there's a problem with the base.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

It's like a patchwork quilt.

611
00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a proper blind baking.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

including Syabira, weirdly.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's going to be
a tricky showstopper today.

652
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

656

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a visually spectacular
mousse-based dessert

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could be Quentin Tarantino's

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm feeling nervous about this challenge.
I hope this time they will like it.

[Paul] Our showstopper challenge
is mousse cake.

671
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bakers have got to produce
what essentially is magic.

672
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

smack bang in the middle.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The most difficult part
is the surprise.

676
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause you want that surprise
to be seen in every slice.

677
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm using gelatine,
which helps set a mousse.

678
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
More gelatine. It's like a gelatine fest.

679
00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] This is all about
the use of gelatine.

680
00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because in and around that surprise,
it's got to be stable.

681
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gelatine is my enemy.

682
00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] They must be careful
because too much gelatine

683
00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
instead of getting
something light and airy,

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they'll get something
that's rubbery and unpleasant.

685

with the watermelon.

1036
00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Today we're going, "Where's the flavour?"

1037
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cake looks amazing.
Is that Sandro Island down there?

1038
00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is my island, yeah.
-[laughter]

1039
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wow!
-Oh, look at that.

1040
00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Ooh!

1041
00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] You can see the Earth's core.
-[Prue] Isn't it clever?

1042
00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sandro, it is absolutely astonishing.

1043
00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] To be able
to put that design together with mousse

1044
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and keep that shape is impressive.

1045
00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks.

1046
00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is Prosecco jelly with fruits,

1047
00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then it's the white chocolate mousse.

1048
00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chocolate mousse
is mousse-like, light, perfect.

1049
00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the core.

1050
00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Love the textures.
I enjoyed the flavours as well.

1051
00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well designed, well thought through.

1052
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Sandro.
-Thank you.

1053
00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Well done.

1054
00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>♪ He's got the whole world ♪</i>

1055
00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughter]

1056
00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs in relief]

1057
00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It looks very '70s.
-Bit of a Fanny Cradock job.

1058
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it is.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1059
00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] There's nothing wrong with that.
-[Paul] Right.

1060
00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Wow!
-[Paul] Wow, that is a strawberry.

1061
00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the strawberry's red velvet.

1062
00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1063
00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Strawberry mousse is fantastic.

1064
00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your chocolate one is too gelatinous.

1065
00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And also, both bits
of the cake are a bit tough.

1066
00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

1067
00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You look a bit dejected.

1068
00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn't look
as sharp as I wanted it to look.

1069
00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So--
-[Paul] It's gone a bit wayward.

1070
00:51:58.480 --> 00:51:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

1071
00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, is that your toadstool? The pink bit?

1072
00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it's lost its,
er, shape a little bit.

1073
00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That was very ambitious
to try to do a mousse toadstool shape.

1074
00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What does the jelly represent?

1075
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dawn] It's supposed to be a flower.

1076
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wanted to leave it in,
even though it had lost its shape

1077
00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because I like the sharpness.

1078
00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sharpness of the jelly is delicious.
The textures are very good.

1079
00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A very creamy mousse.

1080
00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The lime one's got yoghurt in it as well.

1081
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Technically, both the mousses
and the dacquoise together are perfect.

1082
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, good.

1083
00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] However, you have no real surprise.

1084
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Surprise is there's nothing.
-There's nothing. Yeah, well done.

1085
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] No one saw that coming.

1086
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But what was a delicious surprise
was the jelly.

1087
00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks.
-[Noel] Well done.

1088
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1089
00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Well done.

1090
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dawn] The feedback
was better than I thought.

1091
00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They did like the flavours.

1092
00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That was the only positive thing
that could have come out of that, really.

1093
00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carole] Have I done enough to stay?

1094
00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. I still give it 50/50.

1095
00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I've got to go, I've got to go.

1096
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll go weed the garden.

1097
00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

1098
00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[quacking]

1099
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:25.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Those were some
good-looking showstoppers, weren't they?

1100
00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They looked good.
-[Matt] Yeah.

1101
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not all of them
had quite the right texture.

1102
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For instance, look at Abdul's cake,
which looked amazing,

1103
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but tasted awful.

1104
00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But then you look at Dawn's,

1105
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that didn't look very good,
but tasted amazing.

1106
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did anyone manage to get their
designs inside and their textures right?

1107
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sandro did well.
-[Prue] Sandro.

1108
00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Sandro?
-[Paul] Yeah.

1109
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Sandro and Janusz
are in line for Star Baker.

1110
00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think, for me, in trouble, is Carole.

1111
00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Chocolate mousse,
it was just, it was too stiff again.

1112
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] She has not had a good week.

1113
00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know if she's done enough
to pull herself out of a hole.

1114
00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] And then you look at Dawn.

1115
00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dawn's a good baker.

1116
00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just feel
she's messed up on little things,

1117
00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which has snowballed
into something that's quite big,

1118
00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you think, "Oh, she could go."

1119
00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And Syabira?

1120
00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For someone
who's so potent with their flavours,

1121
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
she's failed us this week,
on a signature and on a showstopper.

1122
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, bakers, that was a tough week.
And that was an epic showstopper.

1123
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, there can only be one Star Baker.

1124
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that Star Baker is…

1125
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sandro.

1126
00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Dawn gasps] Well done.
-[applause]

1127
00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughter]

1128
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Well done, Sandro.
-Thank you.

1129
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That leaves me with the horrible task
of announcing the person who's leaving us.

1130
00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unfortunately, the person
who's leaving us this week is…

1131
00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Carole.

1132
00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Carole.

1133
00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carole chuckling]

1134
00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] Oh!

1135
00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carole] That's all right. My time to go.

1136
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very proud of myself,

1137
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause I've come here
to achieve something as I get older.

1138
00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Dawn] So sorry.
-That's all right.

1139

[Carole] Even to get through
and walk through that tent,

1141
00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that is an achievement in itself.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1143
00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Next week, I'm going to focus more
on the flavour and be brave. [chuckles]

1146
00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm delighted and stunned

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

He's been craving the Star Baker
from the get-go, I think.

1150
00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Sandro] Janusz started so good this week,
so I thought he would've got it.

1154
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's been bouncing
between him and Maxy,

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I thought that was gonna continue.

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm going to definitely

'cause now I've got Star Baker,

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've tasted it, and I love it.
