48
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

49
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the pastry gets rough or... full puff.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I've got a caramel with ginger,
lemon zest and sumac, then the carrots.

203
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The judges will see what's underneath,

204
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so hopefully
they'll just basically see the carrots.

205
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rosie] So, I'm gonna caramelise
the vegetables in there.

206
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry goes on top of that,
and it goes in the oven.

207
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, the pattern I'm putting them in now
is the end pattern.

208
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] These leeks have gone very soft.

209
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This could all go wrong, and I've got
only myself to blame if it does.

210
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rosie] It's like there's
too much butter in it.

211
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I might have put too much butter in it.

212
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know whether to tip it all out
and go again,

213
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or whether... I don't wanna do that.

214
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think we've got to a point
where I'm happy with the caramelisation.

215
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fried potatoes
over the top of the tomatoes,

216
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
just so there's a bit of a barrier.

217
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rosie] I'm just trying to remove
some of the extra liquid,

218
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in a totally normal manner that
I was hoping no-one was gonna see.

219
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul came over and was like,
"Don't like goat's cheese."

220
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was like, "Oh, good."

221
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, okay. Good start.
-I'll be using that. Yeah.

222
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'm guessing
you're using goat's cheese.

223
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. And then, "It's simple."

224
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, but, you see,
so there's a Danish word, <i>"enkel",</i>

225
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it means
"beautiful through simplicity".

226
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Simple is fine. I'm quite simple myself.
-Okay...

227
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Actually, not as simple as Noel.
-Well, yeah.

228
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's like taking simple...
-That's another level.

229
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-...to a whole new level.
-Yeah.

230
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs] This Salvador Dali
mobile phone's not working out.

231
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you've got 45 minutes left!

232
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Henry] I need
to put it in the oven right now.

233
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like a pizza.

234
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Black garlic is sweet and strong.
It's really good.

235
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it means the whole thing is dark,
so when they come over and go,

236
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Looks burnt,"
I'll say, "It's black garlic."

237
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now I'm rolling it out.
Just to be, like, my final roll.

238
00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It should take 30 to 40 minutes,

239
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I need to give myself that leeway.
I don't wanna be like,

240
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"One minute left,"
and I'm still trying to flip it out.

241
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's going on as quickly
as is physically possible.

242
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The longer it's out here,
it's just melting and not cooking.

243
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry] Okay, it's in.

244
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] I'm just gonna do a couple more...

245
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just to allow some steam to escape.

246
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] It needs go in the oven ASAP.

247
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That'll do.

248
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

250
00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, go.

251

253
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Putting it in for 20 minutes at 180,
and then 20 minutes at 160,

254
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so turning it down.

255
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, it's gone in at 190.

256
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gonna go for 20 minutes at that,
and then I'm gonna drop it to maybe 180.

257
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing I can do about it.

258
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. So, go for 20 minutes
and see what it looks like.

259
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, it's in.

260
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

262
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna whizz that with olive oil.

263
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going to make the crab salad

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

in this before I turn it out.

about this tin-leaving time.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

326
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

348
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can I have a little bit of that?

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] Yeah. Just with it,
'cause it's quite dry.

357
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Very dry, actually.
-[Prue] It needs the sauce, but...

358
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it shouldn't be saved
by the sauce, really.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not burnt.
-[Sandi] Not burnt, purple.

364
00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:14.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] Well, I love the lattice.
It's very clever.

365
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm a little disappointed
it doesn't look caramelised.

366
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Paul] The layers you can see...

367
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not sure about
how the texture's gonna be on this.

368
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Although we did get a nice...
-[Sandi] Sounds all right.

369
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...crispy bit there.

370
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice.

371
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's a nice colour underneath.

372
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got a little soggy line
running down there.

373
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can taste the honey
and it's lovely with the butter.

374
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is very delicious.
I love the apple and the leeks together.

375
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The leeks melt in your mouth.

376
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just think it's too wet.

377
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you got a bit more colour on that...

378
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah. Yeah.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whew.

381
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

382
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not sure about the goat's cheese
plonked on top like that.

383
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It looks like an add-on,
doesn't it?

384
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

385
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It cuts well.

386
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not very thick. Very thin.

387
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Is that for me?

388
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very nice flavour.

389
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sweetness from the shallots
really comes through.

390
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The caramelisation is great
because you got this slight toffee.

391
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Goat's cheese does work well with it,

392
00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I would have liked
to have seen it inside.

393
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sorry, yeah.
-It is a bit thin, the pastry.

394
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think the flavour
can't be argued with.

395
00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Sandi] Thanks, darling.

396
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's lovely.

397
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispers] It's all right.

398
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The flavour comes from
a red wine and balsamic reduction

399
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with black garlic and chilli.
That's where the colour comes from.

400
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's partly where
the colour comes from.

401
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It looks a bit charred.
-[Rosie] Okay.

402
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's nice and thick.

403
00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] It's a bit wet underneath there.
-[Prue] There are some layers.

404
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They are layers, but--
-But they are a bit soggy.

405
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh, this here, there.

406
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The majority of it is quite wet.

407
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did make a mistake.

408
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I put in twice the amount of butter
when I was doing my caramel,

409
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-so everything was wet at the top.
-[Prue laughs]

410
00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Right.

411
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Quite a lot of garlic.

412
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to have friends around
who like a lot of garlic.

413
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But that is a very soggy bottom.

414
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] It's like a membrane.

415
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you, Rosie.
-Thanks.

416
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's never been like that.

417
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Henry] <i>There's been</i>
<i>a fair bit of muddling through,</i>

418
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but, yeah, that went... really quite well.

419
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't expect it to go that well.

420
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] <i>Yeah, it was a bit dry.</i>

421
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, the sauces were meant
to make it not so dry.

422
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul didn't wanna taste those.
But that's okay.

423
00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosie] <i>Gutted about that.</i>

424
00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dreading the Technical, 'cause, yeah,
another chance to make more soggy pastry.

425
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yay!

426
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>The bakers could practise</i>

427
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>but they have no idea what they'll be</i>
<i>making in the next challenge.</i>

428
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, bakers, welcome back
to your Technical Challenge,

429
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
always everybody's favourite.

430
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Today, it's been set for you by Paul.

431
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Any words of advice?

432
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Consistency really matters
in this challenge.

433
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As opposed to any other challenge. Right.

434
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is he finished?
-[Sandi] I think so.

435
00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As ever, this Technical Challenge
will be judged blind,

436
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I have to ask these two
gorgeous specimens to leave the tent.

437
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Off you pop.

438
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Where are they off to today?
-Paul's having a yard sale.

439
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, he does have a lot of old slippers.
That's fair.

440
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyway,
for your Technical Challenge today,

441
00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul would like you to make a Moroccan pie

442
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
using warqa or brick pastry.

443
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[whispers] What?
-We have no idea.

444
00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Basically, you need to make
12 very thin sheets of warqa pastry,

445
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
whatever that may be,

446
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
wrapped around a perfectly spiced filling
to form a pie.

447
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's all there is to it.

448
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, kids, you've got
two-and-a-half hours.

449
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks...
-Get set...

450
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake.

451
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

452
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never heard of "warqa pastry".

453
00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, I'm guessing it's filo... ish.

454
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I haven't heard of this.
What is this?

455
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If anyone has heard of this,
I will get naked.

456
00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm that confident.

457
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know what this is.

458
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've seen it on a travel programme.

459
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Moroccan pie, Paul. What is it?
-Yeah.

460
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a bit like making filo mince pies.
-Yeah.

461
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got layer on layer
on layer on layer,

462
00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you build it up
and you put your filling in,

463
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then you fold over the top.

464
00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's made with warqa pastry,
or brick pastry.

465
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-And this is the difficult part.

466
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The warqa pastry is quite a loose batter.
-[Prue] Mm-hmm.

467
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's made on a hot plate.

468
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have to put it on with a brush,

469
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but if it's too thin,
as they're brushing it on,

470
00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it'll just disintegrate.

471
00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's too thick,
it'll act like a pancake

472
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and just be like a splodge.
You won't be able to brush it around.

473
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And the mixture is chicken
and obviously a lot of spices.

474
00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, but we haven't told them
how much of the spice to use.

475
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The warqa pastry is crispy,
it's delicious,

476
00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's solid enough to hold
everything together in a slice.

477
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is so Moroccan.
You put it in your mouth

478
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and it's Marrakech.
-Hmm.

479
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, look how thin it is.

480
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't envy them at all,
and there's a heat wave going on.

481
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would we have given this challenge
knowing the weather was gonna be

482
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-as hot as it was?
-You would.

483
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Absolutely, yeah.
-[laughs]

484
00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just not gonna rush this

485
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because there's so much stuff
on this sheet of paper.

486
00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"For the pastry, mix together the flour,
semolina, salt, lemon juice and olive oil.

487
00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then add the water."

488
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't want it to be too thick

489
00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause you're not gonna be able
to get such a thin layer.

490
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Place a flat pan," i.e. that,
"over a pan of simmering water."

491
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Paint the batter thinly in circles

492
00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
until the whole pan is covered
in a layer of batter."

493
00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't get it.

494
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I might just try one and see what happens.

495
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] Oh, gosh.
I feel like this isn't right.

496
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you doing now?

497
00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Explain to me.
-I have no idea what I'm doing.

498
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Surely you can't be putting
wallpaper paste

499
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-on a plate on top of a pan?
-This is grim. I don't know.

500
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is going on? What is it... [sighs]

501
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] The first one
was quite thick, actually.

502
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Trial and error.

503
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] That's the idea,
but I obviously want it to be thicker.

504
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph sighs] Don't get it.

505
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My pan was too hot,
so I've reduced the temperature

506
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it's now a bit easier.

507
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These look a bit better, these.

508
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know why
I didn't do this thicker beforehand.

509
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was clearly the better thing to do.

510
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rosie] I'm not sure I'm doing this right,
but something is forming.

511
00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Getting there.

512
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

516
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is one of my biggest fears,
not being able to present something.

517

-[whispering] Steph, you can do this.
-Okay.

518
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So, don't worry.
-Thank you.

519
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It looks so difficult.
-It's grim.

520
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Keep going.

521
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just gonna take a different approach.

522
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm potentially going to survive
the situation.

[Sandi's voice] Bakers,
you are halfway through.

525
00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sandi, you need a shave.

526
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're starting to look like Adam Hills.

527
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, it's a good look for you.
Pretty sexy.

530
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never cooked chicken before.

531
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is not how I usually cut my meat.
My meat is usually alive.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] So, let's get this in.

533
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm adding the ras-el-hanout now.

536
00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you think that's
too far gone for a chicken?

537
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you able to get
that chicken back on its feet?

538
00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Probably not.
-No.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously they haven't told us
how much to put in.

543
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've gone for a teaspoon of everything.

544
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

555
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's Arabic for "sheet".

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

"Lay one sheet of warqa in the tin

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[David] I don't think so. That's too much.

564
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Let's start with this one. This one...

637
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

643
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't see any base there at all.

644
00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just filling.

645
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

647
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yes, it's got good flavour.

648
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very nice,

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but it does look a bit of a mess.
-[Paul] It does.

650
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Moving on to number two.

651
00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Again, it's broken up a lot.

652
00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've struggled with
the warqa dough in the first place.

653
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, that's difficult to cut.

654
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-There is a base to it, though.
-[Prue] Hmm.

655
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pastry is a bit thick,

656
00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and therefore a bit tough and undercooked.

657
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

658
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

659
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This one, they've struggled
with the consistency of the warqa pastry.

660
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

661
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

662
00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is definitely a base on there.

663
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Quite mild flavoured.
-Hmm.

664
00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] This is much neater, this one.

665
00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It is neater. It's pretty solid.

666
00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I'm really impressed with the top.

667
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got a nice folded look.

668
00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite soggy when you get down
to the bottom layer.

669
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A lot of garlic.

-[Paul] Spicy as well, innit?
-I think there's too much garlic.

671
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Great colour.

672
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

673
00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice.

674
00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good base on it as well.

675
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That it is holding so well together
when it's really very hot...

676
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is.
-...is excellent.

677
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's lovely.

678
00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>Prue and Paul will now</i>

Okay, in fifth position was... this one.

680

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Henry, you struggled
a bit with the warqa pastry,

682
00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and more colour would have been better.

683
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In fourth place, we have this one.

684
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The filling tasted absolutely delicious,

685
00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it needed longer.

686
00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In third position is this one.
Whose is this?

687
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not bad.

688
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The whole thing
came together quite nicely.

689
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you do have
some strong flavours in there.

690
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you go overboard with a few?
Garlic, maybe?

691
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Maybe, yeah.
-I think Prue picked up on.

692
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then in second place...
we have this one.

693
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Whose is it? Rosie.
-Mine.

694
00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And there was some debate about it
because it exploded.

695
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, you know, Rosie,
your pastry was so excellent,

696
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and so flavoursome,

697
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

698
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-We thought it should be second.

699
00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

700
00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. Finally!

701
00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

702
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

so you couldn't see it.

704
00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

707
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Finally got first place.

763
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

and let it all hold its shape.

774
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Why don't any of you just do a sports car?
What's wrong with you?

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can do that in an hour and a half

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought we had two hours left.

945
00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is not enough.

946
00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The, erm...
Oh, that's so not enough time for this.

947
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Pie, pie, pie, pie, pie.

949
00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry] Right, they're in.

950

[Noel] <i>And if perfect pies</i>

952
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] So, these are the horses.

953
00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosie] I'm making a tree.

954
00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is a fairy tale tree.

955
00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] So I am making
a tree trunk for my tree house.

956
00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I'm a little bit mad.

957
00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I realised you can make scales
by using the cutter.

958
00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Henry] These are the shapes
which will go around the edge.

959
00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The thing about chandeliers is,
you can have them as ornate as you'd like.

960
00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, we'll see how ornate this one gets.

961
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[groans]

962
00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the rest of Bert.

963
00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, Sandi, what I'm gonna do is

964
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna throw the sack in the air,
you dive out of it,

965
00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
do a forward roll in midair and say,

966
00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Bakers, you've got
half an hour left." Okay?

967
00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, perfect. One, two, three...

968
00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

969
00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you've got half an hour left!

970
00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Useless.

971
00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I need to get my pie
out of the oven.

972
00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pies need five more minutes,

973
00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I can't really give them
that five more minutes.

974
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Those actually look okay.
I'm actually fairly happy.

975
00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have no idea, but we'll call it done.

976
00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] I'm happy enough with that.

977
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can you hold the glass?
-The glass? Yeah, I've got the glass.

978
00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Henry] It will come off,
there's just something...

979
00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't know what to do.
-Me neither.

980
00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, that's worked.

981
00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Right.

982
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] Definitely lost the portholes.

983
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] I just freaked out then.

984
00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

985
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Important Sandi announcement.

986
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have ten minutes!

987
00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I always want an hour to assemble
and I always have ten minutes.

988
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoo!

989
00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

990
00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Henry] This is gonna act
as a little stand.

991
00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] These waves are strong enough
to hold it up.

992
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A dragon with a head.

993
00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is so stressful now.

994
00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] So they're to just
support the pies.

995
00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosie] No dowels, no.

996
00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not for any reason, other than the fact
that I'm stupid, I think.

997
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] This is the pie of shame.

998
00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Boat to put there, then done.

999
00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, I just need a few minutes
to decorate it.

1000
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have just one minute.

1001
00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Alice] I've made a little swing.

1002
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] It can literally all crash down,

1003
00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but what can you do?

1004
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't get it to hold.

1005
00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm... [sniffles]

1006
00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[softly] Oh, for God's sake.

1007
00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, bakers,
that is the end of the challenge.

1008
00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ta-da.

1009

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1022
00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
strange game.

1023

1026
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

1031
00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like a nasty giant
attacking a castle.

1033
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The pastry's too thick
for the size of that.

1034

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but your filling is very dry
and it's very bitty.

1037
00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It just falls apart.

1038
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was just so scared of the moisture.

1039
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Yeah, but it can be
your enemy as well.

1040
00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The dryness is probably worse.
-I know. Okay.

1041
00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I wanted to have
a quick look in the dragon.

1042
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's a different filling.

1043
00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi and Prue groan]
-[Prue] Bye-bye, Bert.

1044
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue chuckles]

1045
00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] St. George.

1046
00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mm.

1047
00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very dry, too.

1048
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the idea, the sculpture of it,
is excellent.

1049
00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think the textures are all wrong.
-Okay.

1050
00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Thanks, Rosie.
-[Paul] Thank you, Rosie.

1051
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

1052
00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The trunk of the tree,
it's very well done.

1053
00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the overall design
with the swing as well is exceptional.

1054
00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pastry is tough as old boots.

1055
00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've just worked it too much.

1056
00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would not say it's tough as old boots,

1057
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it isn't the tenderest pastry
we've ever had.

1058
00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] And the filling's quite dry.

1059
00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've taken too much moisture out if it.
-[Alice] Yeah.

1060
00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I very seldom say this,

1061
00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I would say there isn't quite enough
sweetness in the filling.

1062
00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The idea is fantastic, but for me...

1063
00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's not quite there.

1064
00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Alice.
-Okay. Thank you.

1065
00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very imaginative.

1066
00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's wonderfully intricate
and really interesting.

1067
00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it's obviously a big marine story.

1068
00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got that whole idea
of three pies being one story.

1069
00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the design is very good,
the way it's been constructed.

1070
00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The exposed veg...

1071
00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't really like.

1072
00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs to be more of a lattice thing
to enclose it, for me.

1073
00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] Mm.

1074
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The pastry could have been baked
a bit longer underneath.

1075
00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm.

1076
00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pastry is lovely and short.

1077
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think your filling
is slightly over-seasoned.

1078
00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I agree, it's a bit too salty.
-[Paul] Hmm.

1079
00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's the smoked salmon.
And it feels quite dry.

1080
00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You lost all the moisture
because it's got no lid.

1081
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It just blew away.

1082
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] Well, I love it.

1083
00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The little horses are lovely.

1084
00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pastry is properly browned.

1085
00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The little pastry...

1086
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-squares could have been thinner.
-[Steph] Mm-hmm.

1087
00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then put on the side.
They're a bit clumsy.

1088
00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1089
00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] But it is neat,
and it's very organised.

1090
00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very Steph.

1091
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue chuckles] Yes.

1092
00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's holding together nicely.

1093
00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

1094
00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Delicious, Steph.

1095
00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not too dry.

1096
00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Curry flavours are lovely.

1097
00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] To get a wall like that,
a filling that's not moving,

1098
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and still carry the moisture
and the spices,

1099
00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's really, really good.

1100
00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The pastry is nice and thin.
-And nice and thin.

1101
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it's flaky.

1102
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a really nice pie.

1103
00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Steph] Oh, thanks.
-Thank you, Steph.

1104
00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-[Steph] Thank you.

1105
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispers] Well done.

1106
00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Henry, would you like to bring up

1107
00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-your vertical pie?
-[Henry] Yes.

1108
00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[groans]

1109
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi exclaims]
-[Henry] This is terrifying.

1110
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh, sh--

1111
00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1112
00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] Right.

1113
00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, my first feeling is,

1114
00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
basically, you've stacked
one pie on top of another...

1115
00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-...which is a bit unimaginative.

1116
00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Putting dried leaves on top of a pie
is never a good idea.

1117
00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It just doesn't look good.

1118
00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But let's look at
one of the pies, shall we?

1119
00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul clears throat]

1120
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue chuckles]
-[Sandi] What's that face?

1121
00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul sighs]

1122
00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What am I gonna say, Henry?

1123
00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My pastry is a little thick.

1124
00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] "A little thick"?
-[Prue chuckles]

1125
00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a lot thick.
-[Henry] Okay.

1126
00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So much so that you've got
rawness in there as well.

1127
00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You needed that paper-thin.

1128
00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is very dry.

1129
00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you'd used a fattier meat,

1130
00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-you'd have got a better result.
-[Henry] Okay.

1131
00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's bone-dry.

1132
00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's happened is all the moisture's
come out the hole at the top.

1133
00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a shame.

1134
00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's quite thick as well, isn't it?

1135
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know what it tastes like?

1136
00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mince pie.

1137
00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Hmm.
-[chuckles]

1138
00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not getting a lot of chocolate.

1139
00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not getting the pecan.

1140
00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm getting more Christmas flavours
coming through.

1141
00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, the idea's there, Henry,

1144
00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but not executed
to the best of your ability.

1145
00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maddening.

1146
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thank you.

1147
00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Henry] <i>Am I in danger? Yeah.</i>

1149
00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This leaves me...

1150
00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
inches beneath the guillotine blade.

[Rosie] <i>It's probably</i>

1152
00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>in terms of who's going home.</i>

1153
00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Also one of the hardest points</i>

1154
00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's gonna be horrific.

1155
00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not gonna lie,
if it's me, I'll be gutted.

1156

1157
00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We didn't try anything,
but it was a visual feast.

1158
00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Unfortunately, that's where it stopped.

1159
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ah.
-[laughs]

1160
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It was so disappointing.

1161
00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] That horrible word
kept creeping back in.

1162
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-"Dry".
-[Prue] Dry.

1163
00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The only one that got it right was Steph.

1164
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's come from very middle ground

1165
00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to put herself in line for Star Baker.

1166
00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
David must be up there for Star Baker
because he came first in the Technical...

1167
00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And his design was amazing.

1168
00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's look at who we're worried about.

1169
00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The one I was, I suppose,
most disappointed by is Henry.

1170
00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The dryness and the thickness
of the pastry.

1171
00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was just so disappointing,
was it not, as a design?

1172
00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Yes, he just stacked a few pies,
one on top of another,

1173
00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
said it's an upside-down chandelier,
and that's the theme.

1174
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even though he did well in his Signature,

1175
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he struggled with the Technical,

1176
00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and he struggled with this as well.

1177
00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I imagine we're worried about Rosie.

1178
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You didn't particularly
like her Signature.

1179
00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it didn't look particularly good.

1180
00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] And the Showstopper,
she struggled a bit.

1181
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The design was probably one of the best,

1182
00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it was very, very dry.

1183
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The whole thing just fell to pieces.

1184
00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think they're both in trouble.

1185
00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To come this far,

1186
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's a terrible point in the competition
to go out, isn't it?

1187
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, my lovely bakers.

1188
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the moment we find out
who is going through to the semifinal.

1189
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can tell you that one person
who definitely is,

1190
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is the Star Baker of this week,
and that person is...

1191
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Steph.

1192
00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry] Oh, my darling.

1193
00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That means I've got
the horrible, horrible job

1194
00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of announcing which baker is going home.

1195
00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:35.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The baker who's leaving us this week is...

1196
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Henry.

1197
00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Oh, Henry.

1198
00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my darling.

1199
00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I met Paul outside the <i>Bake Off</i> tent
when I was 12.

1200
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I remember shaking his hand.

1201
00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Unlucky, mate.

1202
00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Henry] <i>And I never thought</i>
<i>it would get to a stage</i>

1203
00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
where I was standing behind
one of the benches in there,

1204
00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
actually baking.

1205
00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you struggled a bit today.

1206
00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just a bit. [laughs]
-[Paul] Yeah.

1207
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think he's done a great job, overall,
and he has improved.

1208
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

<i>the other four are better.</i>

1209
00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has been a pleasure, darling.

1210
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Henry!

1211
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Henry is awesome. He's great.

1214
00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But so happy to still be here.

1215
00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Well done.
-Thank you.

1216
00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Rosie's still not
believing her luck.

1217

1219
00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

1220
00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, wow. Wow, wow, wow.

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1222
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, Steph-Steph.

1223
00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Steph's Showstopper was faultless.

1224
00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:42.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could not find a single thing
to complain on.

1225
00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this real? [chuckles]
