00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>[Prue] Absolutely delicious,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>and it's such a sophisticated thing to do.</c.bg_transparent>

1149
00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>The other thing</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>that was really good was Peter's.</c.bg_transparent>

1150
00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>[Paul] I liked the fact that he had</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>different mousses going in.</c.bg_transparent>

1151
00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Each one, the flavours were amazing.</c.bg_transparent>

1152
00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>I would like to give Star Baker</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>to both those boys.</c.bg_transparent>

1153
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>But what I found so disappointing</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>is Hermine.</c.bg_transparent>

1154
00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>This is Patisserie Week.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>It should've been her finest hour, really.</c.bg_transparent>

1155
00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>[Paul] This is basically a rubber ball.</c.bg_transparent>

1156
00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>But in her defence,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>Hermine made two things.</c.bg_transparent>

1157
00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Laura did one cake.</c.bg_transparent>

1158
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Doesn't look brilliant,</c.bg_transparent>

1159
00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>but when you bit into that,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>that was absolutely delicious.</c.bg_transparent>

1160
00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>But how many times have we said</c.bg_transparent>

1161
00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Laura's got to save herself</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>in the showstopper? Five times?</c.bg_transparent>

1162
00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Hermine did have a better technical.</c.bg_transparent>

1163
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>This is a tricky one.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>This could go either way.</c.bg_transparent>

1164
00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-[Matt] Really?</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-Yeah.</c.bg_transparent>

1165
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>And this is the worst time</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>to go out, isn't it?</c.bg_transparent>

1166
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-It's heartbreaking. You're just there.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-It's brutal.</c.bg_transparent>

1167
00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>But that's the position we're in.</c.bg_transparent>

1168
00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Well, it's time for me to tell you</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>who has been Star Baker this week.</c.bg_transparent>

1169
00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>There are a couple of candidates,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>but this week's Star Baker is…</c.bg_transparent>

1170
00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Peter.</c.bg_transparent>

1171
00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Well done, Peter.</c.bg_transparent>

1172
00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>That leaves me</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>with the horrible job of announcing</c.bg_transparent>

1173
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>the baker who will be leaving us.</c.bg_transparent>

1174
00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>It's especially hard</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>because the person who's leaving us</c.bg_transparent>

1175
00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>is not gonna get to the final,</c.bg_transparent>

1176
00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>and you've all been so fantastic</c.bg_transparent>

1177
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>But sadly, there can only be three.</c.bg_transparent>

1178
00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>So the person who is leaving us…</c.bg_transparent>

1179
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

<c.bg_transparent>I'm disappointed 'cause, er,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>I didn't want to leave.</c.bg_transparent>

1183
00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-[Laura] Sorry.</c.bg_transparent>
