00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

but it's not something I have often.

so… [laughs]

51
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is Back to School Week.

52
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all about reinventing bakes
that you had at school,

53
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
only this time,
making them really, really good.

54
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This golden syrup is gonna get messy.

55
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a flapjack. It's just full of sugar
and predominantly golden syrup.

56
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And so, it'll be interesting to see
how the bakers interpret the sugar levels.

57
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've taken out the golden syrup

58
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then replaced it
with a red wine reduction.

59
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We want a very special flapjack,

60
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I think you have to be careful
with the adding of new flavours

61
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because you don't want
to overpower the oats.

62
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] We're really asking the bakers
to push the boat out

66
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and create a little bit of school magic.

67
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Morning, Tom.

69
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, Tom,
tell us all about your flapjack.

70
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Today I'm making apple crumble flapjack,

71
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but this is kind of pushing the brief
in terms of what a flapjack is.

72
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it should look like
the top half of an apple,

73
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then when you slice it open,

74
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you're like, "Oh, there's a flapjack

[Iain] So these are Irish oats, obviously.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

<i>…choosing the right oats is crucial.</i>

90
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you want it

95
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

96
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause I'm doing a carrot cake recipe

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

99
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

because the icing is thick.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, they've got to beat the sugar
and butter by hand.

491
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

these sprinkles then?

493
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To make the sprinkles,
they have to pipe the lines,

494
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
wait till they're absolutely set,
chop them into tiny little sprinkles,

495
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and scatter them on top of their icing
when it's still wet.

496
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then we've asked them
to make lump-free custard.

497
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

498
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That sweetness from the icing
is just about right.

499
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sponge is moist,

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

that's fantastic.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

but this is the best.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

there are no weights.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

it's all different shapes again.

708
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It should be easy
to get them all the same size.

709
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mainly, my complaint about this
is unevenness.

712
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Probably the weight of the icing,
to be honest.

713
00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Noel] Hello, bakers.

772
00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's time for your back-to-school
Showstopper challenge.

773
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But before we start,
Noel, what was you like at school?

774
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was pretty good, actually.
I was second from top in my class.

775
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Who was first?
-It was my brother.

776
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just the two of us, actually.
We were home-schooled.

777
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, for your Showstopper challenge,

779
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:54.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now the judges will be looking
for an array of decorative themed treats

781
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that really capture the spirit
of the summer school fête.

782
00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your display should have
at least one large bake

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My primary school
had an amazing school fair.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

at like hook-a-duck, quoits.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I always used to head to the bake stall.
Used to love it.

790
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I always do the tombola
at the kids' school fairs

791
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause I wanna win some wine.

792
00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

The bakers' Showstopper challenge,
it's gonna be a tricky one.

795
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're asking them to reproduce
a traditional school summer fête in bakes.

796
00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Toby] So I'm starting with the cake.

797
00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite hefty.
I'll get that out of the way first.

798
00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a demanding challenge.

799
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We want them to display at least
three different baking disciplines,

800
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the difficulty with that
is about timing.

801
00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is where we have to have
a bit of a balancing act.

802
00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never had three things
on the go at once.

803
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The hardest part of multi-baking
is different rising temperatures,

804
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
different oven temperatures.

805
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They could go wrong in every single area.

806
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a very busy bench today.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I think have a great baking flair
to produce something magical,

809
00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which we expect today.

some choux bun tennis balls

-Mm.

-Don't tell me you made the sprinkles?
-No, I didn't make the sprinkles.

No one's ever gonna make sprinkles
by hand again. [chuckles]

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] There's a lot of stuff
going on in here.

1241
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I particularly like
the look of the burgers.

1242
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that bread you've made?
-No, I've made like a doughnut.

-It's doughnuts twice.

1244
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Clever. Let's have a look at this.

1245
00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I've done a lemon drizzle sponge cake.

1246
00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's slightly overbaked.

1247
00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-The flavour's nice.

1248
00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The doughnuts are just vanilla doughnuts
with a strawberry glaze.

1249
00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a nice little structure
you've got inside there.

1250
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Strawberry flavour is really fake.
-[Paul] Yeah, it is. Yeah.

1251
00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] This is a lemon?
-[Nadia] Lemon dip, yeah.

1252
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lemon curd is wonderful
and it's really sharp.

1253
00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] A nice little sugar biscuit.

1254
00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you gonna eat it like a burger?

1255
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Nadia] Yeah, you've got to.

1256
00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison] Oh, yeah.

1257
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've really got to switch your mind
'cause you just expect beef. [chuckles]

1258
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-Pretty clever.

1259
00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got a good brownie in there.
The whole thing is delicious.

1261
00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I think triceratops is looking a bit sad.

1262
00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overall, I'm a bit underwhelmed
because it doesn't pop.

1263
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1264
00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I have made for you
a stout cake with a stout caramel

1265
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a milk chocolate whipped ganache.

1266
00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Mmm.

1267
00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Texture's all wrong.
-[Jessika] I know.

1268
00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's the flavour
I'm not really keen on.

1269
00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not much else there.
-There's a bitterness to it.

1270
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Let's have a look at these feet.

1271
00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shortbread biscuit with marshmallow
and a cherry and kirsch jam.

1272
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I quite like that. I think it probably
needed more bake on the biscuit.

1273
00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a bit soft.
-Yeah.

1274
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] This is the egg.
-It's a chai whipped ganache,

1275
00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
some biscuit, and then
there's an Italian meringue in there.

1276
00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite strong, that.

1277
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think I'd like that
in very small quantities.

1278
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it isn't.

1279
00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.
-[Prue] Thanks, Jess.

1280
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel whispering] I love the way it looks.

1281
00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1282
00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jessika] That was brutal.

1283
00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was brutal.

1284
00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A bake like that,
I don't think is redeemable.

1285
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Definitely one of the bottom ones
in the Showstopper.

1286
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, I don't want to go home,
but I think I probably deserve to.

1289
00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a Showstopper. Twists and turns.

1290
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I was so surprised
with regards to Aaron.

1291
00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He literally had smashed the Technical,
smashed the Signature,

1292
00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and this looked smashed.

1293
00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Unfortunately,
he was in line for Star Baker,

1294
00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but he's certainly dropped down the order.

1295
00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On the other hand,
I think Jasmine did well.

1296
00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thought the cake was good.

1297
00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Her finesse is on a different level
though, isn't it?

1298
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, look at that piping. Beautiful.

1299
00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I did like Tom's.

1300
00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think Toby's joined him.
-Toby did well.

1301
00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Toby's balls were amazing. [laughs]
-His balls were--

1302
00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I think he's put himself in line
for Star Baker.

1303
00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, someone
is not gonna graduate today.

1304
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The one I'm most sort of disappointed in
is Iain.

1305
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He can bake better than that.

1306
00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was three different disciplines,
and, for me, he failed on all three.

1307
00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] What about Jessika?
-[Paul] But not just the bake.

1308
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was about
the flavour combinations were wrong.

1309
00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She was in a bit of danger anyway
coming into today.

1310
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think, on the other hand,
Nadia and Nataliia,

1311
00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
who were in serious trouble,

1312
00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
have both lifted themselves up.

1313
00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, unfortunately,
I think it's between Jessika and Iain.

1314
00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I agree.

1315
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, listen, it's been great.

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

of announcing this week's Star Baker.

for your hat trick next week.

that leaves me with the horrible job.

and she takes risks every single week.

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
