00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] I love making desserts at home,
puddingy things, really soft.

47
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it's Pudding Week. [laughs]

Now, the judges would love you
to make eight meringue nests.

54
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I first met Paul Hollywood,
he was asleep in a meringue nest.

55
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I pulled him out of there,
reared him, clipped his wings,

56
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
put him in some stonewashed denim
and, er, yeah, we got on famously.

57
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] And here we are.
-Yeah.

58
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

59
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now your baked meringue
could be any style that you choose

60
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it must have at least two fillings
like a good jacket potato.

61
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I probably wouldn't choose
beans or cheese.

62
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

63
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On your marks.

66
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Illiyin] Meringue can be quite
melt-in-your-mouth, and I'm excited.

67
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you're excited by it,
it's usually gonna be okay.

68
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Georgie] I practised so much.

69
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My son has been eating meringues
like it's nobody's business. Loves them.

70
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Meringue's one of my favourites.
Practically 100% sugar. [laughs]

71
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's Dessert Week, and for me,
that's the best week of the year.

72
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're asking the bakers
to make meringue nests,

73
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is piped meringue
so that you get a basket or a nest shape.

74
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They can fill it with anything
but we need at least two fillings.

75
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Obviously, fillings can be anything

76
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's critical to get those flavours
balancing beautifully.

77
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna make a lime gel.

78
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything else is quite sweet
so that sharpness is really nice.

79
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
French meringue is the classic way
to make a meringue nest.

80
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's about getting the air into the egg.

81
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You whip it up to a stiff peak
so it's beautiful and smooth.

82
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am adding my sugar
very slowly to my egg whites

83
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I don't deflate them
'cause it's all about the air today.

84
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The perfect meringue nest is very stable.

85
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It must absolutely hold their fillings.

86
00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:21.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to bake it low and slow
to get every bit of moisture

87
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
out of that meringue, then it'll be rigid.

88
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Meringues can be temperamental.

89
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just hope they turn out okay
and don't go all cracky.

90
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's getting into the latter stages
and they really need to show off, really.

91
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-[Prue] Good morning.

94
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

all about your meringue nests.

95
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So these are my piña colada
meringue nests.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

513
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tie it up like a package.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yay. I figured it out. [laughs]

516

[Dylan] I don't know how
you keep it tight.

518
00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need a finger. This is what I have

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Put the plate in the bottom and
it keeps it off the heat at the bottom.

531
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't want the water
to actually touch the pudding.

532
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

no higher.

534
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that's enough. It's gotta be.

535
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You want it to steam but not boil

536
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and let out moisture into the spotted dick
'cause it'll be too wet.

537
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Gill] This is what I do at home.
Top it up again afterwards.

539
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've gotta keep an eye
because my water level's quite high,

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

541
00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I'm confused.

542
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Guess the pitfall's
the time it takes to steam.

543
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's gonna take ages.
Take at least an hour, 100%.

544
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need to steam it
at least for an hour and a half.

545
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It takes quite a long time
because it's a big pudding.

546
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

553
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wanna give it at least
an hour to steam, like, minimum.

554
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the three classics:

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's basically mascarpone cream,
coffee and a sponge lady's fingers.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

749
00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Coffee will be a king in this.

750
00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We want to taste the coffee,

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but we don't want something too strong
because it overwhelms the whole thing.

752
00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Coffee. Very strong.
But I like it like that.

753

[Prue] Tiramisu, it's traditionally
a soft pudding in a bowl.

755
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

something different. Elaborate.

920
00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So that can go in the freezer.

921
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it doesn't set,
it will literally just splurge.

922
00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] <i>And could collapse when demoulded.</i>

923
00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Georgie] In there couple of hours.

924
00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Gill] For as long as
I can give them to set.

925
00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>However, Dylan's not yet</i>

926
00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] So the whole dessert is gonna be
encased in a tempered chocolate box.

927
00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] <i>He's got a box to build.</i>

928
00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] So I've got my grey colours here.
Just pour it out.

929
00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are the sides.
The big chocolate slabs are the sides.

930
00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These just need to set.

931
00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you do really well today,
you get a Star Baker.

932
00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dylan] Yeah.

933
00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'd have got the handshake,
the technical and the Star Baker.

934
00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It'd be a good clean run, wouldn't it?

935
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Think you can?

936
00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As long as it comes up good
and I make my box, I'm happy.

937
00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just don't have any big disasters.

938
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

939
00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, now we're moving on
to the chocolate decorations.

940
00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] I'll have
a marbled effect chocolate collar.

941
00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's weird. This side looks a mess,
but then you turn it over it's lovely.

942
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan] It's gonna be
a black and white collar.

943
00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Memphis Milano is the inspiration.
It's very '80s.

944
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sumayah] I'll have a joconde
round the outside with a batik design.

945
00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sumayah mentioned lemon coffee curd.

946
00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lemon curd is quite tangy,
it's quite tart.

947
00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With coffee, that'll be interesting.

948
00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now coating some lady fingers in chocolate
and putting some desiccated coconut on.

949
00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Gill hates coffee.
-I know. Gotta get those levels perfect.

950
00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She got her husband to taste it, so…
-That's true.

951
00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:12.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm hoping they will taste coffee.
Getting the balance is the challenge.

952
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The vision is cage.

953
00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Illiyin's putting that cage around it.

954
00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just a question whether
she can do the decoration well enough.

955
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah.

956
00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm about to put my box together.
So I need to cut these to size.

957
00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As long as nothing devastating
happens to them, I'm good.

958
00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Dylan.

959
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'Cause he's got this box.

960
00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I like the idea of Dylan.
I don't know if it'll hold.

961
00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's my only issue,
how stable it's gonna be.

962
00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dylan] Oh, no. So annoying.

963
00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs] I could redo it
by tempering chocolate.

964
00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's such a long process.
I'm gonna have to cut the top off them.

965
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is such an arduous process.

966
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[birds chirping]

967
00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have 30 minutes left.

968
00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:58.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just need to get the cake out now.
-[Sumayah] Oh, that's frozen!

969
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, my God, it's so cold,
it's burning my hands.

970
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all right, that bit.
I only need it eight centimetres high.

971
00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I only have that tiny bit there.

972
00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Illiyin] I need to get this out.

973
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's not set, it's a problem
because it will just all collapse.

974
00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I hate this part.

975
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Christiaan] That's all right.

976
00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Illiyin] Still quite soft.

977

978
00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] Looks a little wet.
Probably too much coffee.

979
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] That's set.
So I need to put my tiramisu in there.

980
00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Is this the chocolate box?

981
00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you stay away from it?
I just don't trust you.

982
00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[clanging]
-You're telling me not to be clumsy.

983
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're like Frank Spencer.

-Who's Frank Spencer?
-[Alison] You're so young.

985
00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He doesn't know Frank Spencer.
We're so old.

986
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] I know.
-I told my parents you guys were 50.

987
00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They were surprised.
-Er… can we just rewind?

988
00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm 49.

-Yes, but average 50.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm still in my forties.
-But, no, you guys are 50.

991
00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take your age and average it, it's 50.

992
00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hello! I'm not 50!
-We're a century old.

993
00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just need to get the collar on.
It's so heavy. It's hard.

994
00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] All it means is
I've been in the queue

995
00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a little bit longer than you--

996
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A little?
-Doesn't mean my--

997
00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you've been in the queue
2.5 times the amount than I have.

998
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

999
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He hasn't even come in the shop yet.

1000
00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you feel closer to death,
or do you not…

1001
00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Do you feel closer to death?

1002
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, but my body is not decaying.
After 27 your body starts decaying.

1003
00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
End of the day you could get hit by a bus.

1004
00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could die before me.

1005
00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's morbid.

1006
00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Gill] It will have the lady fingers
around the outside.

1007
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's my joconde.
I'm just trimming off the overlap.

1008
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh-oh, that's way too much.
How long do we have left?

1009
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you've got ten minutes left.

1010
00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ahh!

1011
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] Oh, no. I need to be move quicker.
Cream at the bottom,

1012
00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and on top, the layer of lady fingers.

-[Christiaan] It looks very shiny.

1014
00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's pretty good.
Shine on it is quite good.

Is it going well?

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It'll be like Noel.

is beautifully done

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

So it's a mascarpone mousse,
lady finger sponge, a coffee lemon curd.

The band of very, very strong
lemony coffee is a bit of a shock.

like the sharpness with the coffee.

[Prue] In a way, if it had have been
thinner layers of it, it would be better.

1132
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
