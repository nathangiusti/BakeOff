00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

420
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I never wanna see it again.

421
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

422
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think we have enough.

423
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

424
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

430
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

432
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd be all over that.

433
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Keith] I've tried to raise
my prettiness game this last year or so.

435
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dana] It's a bit lopsided.

438
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's fair to say there's prettier
drip cakes on display.

439

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] Just to make it look
a little bit civilised.

442
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not quite as I envisaged.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

449
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I could put my face in that.

450
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Think I'll get away with that?

451
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you've overbaked your sponges.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

513
00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got the sharpness from the outside.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

536
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is rhubarb and custard.

537
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

539
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the slice is quite moreish. Good job.

-Tiny circus tent.

542
00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks so dramatic
and the colours are so strong contrast

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. It's delicious.

548
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cream is so light
against the density of the chocolate,

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then that orange liqueur,
it is absolutely delicious.

550
00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I could happily eat all of that.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

But you know what?
Its flavour might save it.

560
00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've certainly got the stripes.

561
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've got too much
filling to cake, though.

562
00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is very unusual.

563
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

564
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

565
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
less of the filling
and more of the sponge…

566
00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Hmm.
-…that would've been brilliant.

567
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it looks terrible.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

some of Paul's rudeness. [chuckles]

572

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was such a mixed bag,

574
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it was definitely leaning
on the side of bad.

576

577
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

578
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

to a point, but not cold

618
00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because it'll be solid.

619
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When it comes into contact
with a sponge, if it's warm,

620
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's just gonna run out.

622
00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The issue when you use the fridge
with ganache,

623
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-you can matt the chocolate.
-And we want shiny.

[Paul] Let's take a slice of this, Prue.

625
00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Straight away, you see the ganache
smack in the middle.

626
00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's beautifully set, soft and luscious,

627
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but not pouring out like a volcano.

628
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a chocoholic's dream.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't have any more, Prue.
-I can't help it.

630
00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've gotta go in
and have 12 of these.

631
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, you've more discipline than I have.

632
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

"Melt and combine the chocolate,

634
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna start putting together
all the wet ingredients.

635
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've got sour cream,

636
00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the iconic cake.

637
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You see this cake
every single time you watch.

638
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

642
00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just using the spatula to fold it through.

643
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm…

644
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel like I've made a mistake.

645
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I might have used twice as much chocolate
for the actual cake,

646
00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I'm just
kind of hoping that it's fine.

647
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everyone loves a good chocolate cake.

648

649
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Goodbye, see you laters.

650
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just says "bake," so it's very helpful.
Love that, Paul, don't you? [laughs]

651
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll be baking the cakes for 35 minutes.

652
00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is already set to 35.
Do you think that's a sign?

653
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll try 30, first.

654
00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or 35?

655
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thirty-five.

656

657
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not much to say about ganache, really.
It's not afraid to be itself.

658
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like I'm slightly
at an unfair advantage…

659
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why?
-…as I made ganache this morning.

660
00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Feels like cheating.

661
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's why we're staring at you.

662
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-Is that why?

663
00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's looking good, looking silky smooth.
-It's lovely and glossy.

664
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could have a bath in that.

665
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm hesitant to put it in the fridge.
I wanna keep it as shiny as possible.

666
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I stick it in the fridge,
it might not be shiny any more.

668
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's gonna take
a really long time to cool.

669
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll be utilising the fridge.

670
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Probably go all wrong, but I'm chilling.

671

-[Dana] I put the ganache in the freezer.
-Otherwise the ganache will get splodgy.

How do you feel about things?

677
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Probably been up
since about 4:00? [laughs]

678
00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Half-three I woke up.

679
00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you lie in bed
thinking about what you're gonna do?

680
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm like, "My God, I can't switch off."

681
00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it better when you imagine it?

682
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.

683
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Every time.

684
00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah. Prue--

685
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

686
00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I'll give the top one a poke.

687
00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You want it, like, quite light and airy.

688
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Keith] There was an emphasis
on the word "moist."

689
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It should come out
with a few crumbs attached.

690
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Aye-aye.

-[Keith] Reasonably happy with them.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wouldn't be <i>Bake Off</i>

695
00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The most important thing
is getting it chilled quickly,

696
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so the ganache
doesn't just run all out of it.

697
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

698
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matty] I just put it in the fridge.

700
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The amount of time I have
is very disconcerting.

701
00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was not expecting
my first technical to go like this.

Ah, it's lovely out there.

-Alison, would you like a sign name?
-I would love a sign name.

705
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like "Alison"?

706

707
00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love it. Have you got a sign name

708
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

709
00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tasha] I have problems
getting my words out sometimes.

710
00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I tried to say Paul Hollywood
and I came out with "Pollywood."

712
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, like, it's Polly, like the parrot.

713
00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

They're a little,

If I was at home,
I'd have left them for an hour.

725
00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I haven't got an hour,
so gonna have to roll with them.

726
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

The ganache has set
a bit too much in the fridge,

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

in the microwave.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was fine and now it's split.
I've been putting it

734
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

when everyone else is cracking on.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

742
00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My beautiful ganache, which
has been perfect, has slightly split.

743
00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm gonna add in a bit of butter,
to bring it back to emulsion.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Cristy] I can't remember if the finish is
straight-edged or if it has a full ripple.

745
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs to be really, really good
because it's so iconic.

746
00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

751
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn't say whether to include
the raspberry or not.

754
00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:31.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

756
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How many sleepless nights
I've had over that missing raspberry.

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

758
00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know it's got one missing,
so I've left the perfect gap.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

760
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's here. You can put it on if you want.
I'm not gonna do it for you.

828
00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a little bit light,
a little bit matt.

829
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's beautifully conceived.

1237
00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I love the colours of it.

-I love that river the duck's sitting on.
-[Prue] This is isomalt lake.

1239
00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you've broken his lake.

1240

[Alison] Oh, that's beautiful.

1241
00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is a raspberry cake. Lovely.

1242
00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that's gorgeous, yeah.

1243
00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the raspberry is really tart.

1244
00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It cuts through the sweetness
of the white chocolate. It's lovely.

1245
00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must not eat any more of it.

1246
00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
This is Maisie,
and she's bursting with excitement.

1247
00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1249
00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rough and ready.

1250
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She'd take that.

1251
00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1252
00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's made from
lemon and orange sponge cake

1253
00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1254
00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Far more elegance inside
than it is outside.

1255
00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue laughs] Yes.

1256
00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Delicious.
-[Paul] It's a straightforward cake,

1257
00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you've got the right level of flavours
running through each layer.

1258
00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not oversweet, just full of flavour.

1259
00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1260
00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks like it's been run over.

1262
00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Really nice cake.

1263
00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the flavour of the filling.

1264
00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never seen a spaniel of that colour.

1265
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Me either. [laughs]

1266
00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Oh, right, yeah.

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's really impressive.
It's really good.

1269
00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's orange sponge, lime curd,
and a cherry Swiss meringue buttercream.

1270
00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's almost tutti-frutti,

1271
00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
where you've got
several flavours all in one,

1272
00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you can't identify any.

1273
00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know. I was struggling with what it was.
But it is delicious.

1274
00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It is nice.

1275
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's astonishing to look at.

1276
00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just beautiful.

1277
00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's so accurate.
That could be turtle shell.

1278
00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Saku] This is orange and poppy seed cake

1279
00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1280
00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite stodgy.

1281
00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm. And it's overbaked
quite dramatically.

1282
00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think this is a classic case
of style over substance.

1283
00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:58.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's totally adorable.

1284
00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's see how he tastes.

1285
00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1288
00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cake looks great.

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] Rich chocolate

1290
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and milk chocolate

1291
00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Buttercream on the outside
goes beautifully with the chocolate,

1292
00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so the whole thing is very moreish.

1293
00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, and very, very intense.

1294
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you've done Bruno very proud.

1295
00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, brilliant. Thank you.
-[Paul] I think so.

1296
00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's charming, and I love the way

1297
00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
one of her eyes is completely gone

1298
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1299
00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The coffee
and the date work well,

1300
00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but there's a lot of buttercream in this.

1301
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite flat here.

1302
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened?

1303
00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, she's quite a flat dog.

1304
00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1305
00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She doesn't have much body to her,
I need to feed her a bit more.

1306
00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Dana] It's banana cake coated
with a cinnamon crumble

1308
00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and peanut butter frosting in between.

1309
00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a strong peanut, that.

1310
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] The peanut's quite dominant.
-I'm not getting any banana.

1311
00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think less peanut
would have been better.

1312
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1313
00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She'll have you. [laughs]

1314
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can nick that now, Dan.

1315
00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Straight off, it looks great.
It's got real character in the face.

1316
00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:30.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1317
00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I'll go into its rear quarter.

1318
00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abbi] He is a ginger sponge,
salted caramel buttercream,

1319
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
rhubarb jam, a hazelnut brittle
and then black sesame buttercream.

1320
00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The rhubarb jam is excellent,
and so is the cake.

1321
00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You got a sharpness from that rhubarb,
so the ginger and rhubarb marry,

1322
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that hazelnut is delicious.

1323
00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:55.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With a bit of crunch.

1324
00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've done a really good job, Abbi.

1325
00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much.

1326
00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Amos, would you like to bring up
your showstopper, please?

1327
01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can see what it is.

1328
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a shame
everything's sort of slipped slightly.

1329
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amos] Caramel sponge,
and then we have a apple buttercream.

1330
01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your cake looks a little doughy,
as if it's become compressed.

1331
01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's tough as old boots,
and on top of that,

1332
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the weight of everything going round it,

1333
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it's concertinaed up.

1334
01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's bone dry as well.

1335
01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because you've kept it in the oven.

1336
01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very stodgy, oversweet.

1337
01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not your best day.

1338
01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not in the slightest.

1339
01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nicky, can you bring your showstopper up?

1340
01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is solid, and it shouldn't be bone dry.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is incredible.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The pipe work,
the colour, the stance.

1362
01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I've made a tahini sponge

1365
01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1366
01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think of tahini as a savoury flavour,

1367
01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and this is a cake,

1368
01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's not too savoury
and it's not too sweet,

1369
01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's just very delicious.

1370
01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't like that, Tasha.

1371
01:02:58.760 --> 01:02:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love it.

1372
01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue chuckles] God, what a relief.

1374
01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought I was going to have
my first big battle with Paul Hollywood,

1375
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I would have gone to the wall
to defend you if he'd meant it.

1376
01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the flavour of the tahini.

1377
01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And actually the tahini
with the chocolate,

1378
01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you've got a nice balance between the two.

1379
01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's such a big cake.
That's a lot of work in that.

1380
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow. That was so much better
than I could have ever imagined.

1384
01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

the problem was it was so dense.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

in a very difficult position.

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
