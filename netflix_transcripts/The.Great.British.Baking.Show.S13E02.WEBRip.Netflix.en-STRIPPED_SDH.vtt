<c.bg_transparent>Today's Signature challenge</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>is a slice-and-bake biscuit.</c.bg_transparent>

47
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Normally, when you make a biscuit,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>you make your paste which you roll up,</c.bg_transparent>

48
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>pop in the fridge to chill,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>slice, and then bake it.</c.bg_transparent>

49
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>But the difference is,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>we want them to hide a big design inside.</c.bg_transparent>

50
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>But we don't want a simple pattern</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>like a chequerboard.</c.bg_transparent>

51
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>We want a picture.</c.bg_transparent>

52
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>So the shaping is going to be difficult</c.bg_transparent>

53
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>because the bakers</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>really have to think ahead.</c.bg_transparent>

54
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>You're making something</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>which will only show up as the picture</c.bg_transparent>

55
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>when you slice it.</c.bg_transparent>

56
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>They'll have to make</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>lots of different colours</c.bg_transparent>

57
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>and think in a 3-D way,</c.bg_transparent>

58
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>and that is extremely difficult to do.</c.bg_transparent>

59
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>But this biscuit has another problem.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>It needs to have a snap.</c.bg_transparent>

60
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>But once you add colour to a biscuit,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>it's difficult to know when it's baked.</c.bg_transparent>

61
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>They won't want it to be in there too long</c.bg_transparent>

62
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>because they don't want it to go brown.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>That'll spoil their pattern.</c.bg_transparent>

63
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
