a large cake,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

You want a bit of shape to your meringue.

53
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

60
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

for another big flavour to come in

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

sweated slightly inside

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

almost with the chocolate.

319
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause all the liquid is then soaked

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Okay.

321
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

323
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're very obvious,
there's orange and chocolate.

324
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

325
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's amazing you managed to get
that much chocolate on your apron.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It does look beautiful. It's neat.
It's very professional-looking.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

331
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The raspberry comes through.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you needed to lighten that out,
just take some nuts out,

334
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Okay.

335
00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It tastes lovely. It looks lovely.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

has really risen,

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Henry] It's a little rugged.

340
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The one on the top
should've been at the bottom.

341
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The one on the bottom should be
the second from the top.

342
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Henry] Yeah.
-[Paul] And then these two

343
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
should be inverted and put on top of that.

344
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So that you end up with...

345
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yeah.

346
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Design-wise, it's wanting.

347
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I like the nutty meringue.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Raspberry jam is the saviour of this,
because everything seems to flow with it.

350
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-You didn't make the jam, did you?

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which today has been set for you
by the delight that is Prue.

368
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

some of Paul's recipes.

six identical perfectly-layered verrines.

379
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it roughly translates
as some stuff pushed into a fiddly glass.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. So, the sablé biscuit...

412
00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It means "sand", I believe, in French.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The problem is, by dessert,
you're usually quite drunk, so...

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because if it goes
onto the mango compote warm,

451
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's going to melt the mango compote.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

by and large, disappointing.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

621
00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

622
00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

631
00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's time for your Showstopper Challenge.

Today, Paul and Prue would love you
to make a celebratory bombe dessert.

633
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It must be moulded into a semi-spherical

634
00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] They should contain
at least one baked element,

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

637
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Your celebratory bombe
must be as spectacular on the outside

638
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

639
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're saying "bombe" quite a lot.

640
00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't get enough of it.
[sing-song] Bombe-biddy-bombe-bombe.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[sing-song] Bombe-bombe.
-[Sandi] You've got four-and-a-half hours.

643
00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

644
00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've had lots of disasters this week
trying to make this.

645
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm scared one element will go wrong
and the whole thing will just, like...

646
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

647
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Celebratory bombe really means
a round dessert.

648
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a little bit of luxury, a bombe.

649
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

651
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause you're gonna have
so many different layers,

652
00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so many different textures,

653
00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they've all got to be set

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the probability of all of them collapsing
is very, very high.

656
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope that out will come a perfect slice

657

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

664
00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

666
00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, in the middle
we have the cherry jelly,

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

678
00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michael] I've used freeze-dried cherries.

679
00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

680
00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause when I was putting cherries in,
I was getting a lot of the juice.

681
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, I thought freeze-dried might help.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

994
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

coffee bavarois.

1000

1003
00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1010
00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1015
00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I don't think I'd have blowtorched it

There is a base of honey cake,
mango bavarois

1019
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and lemon and hibiscus mousse.

1020
00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1021
00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

rather than mousse.

1022

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] The base is
a lemon and pistachio Génoise,

1033
00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then it's a raspberry-and-rose jelly,

1034
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then it's a lemon-and-shiso sorbet,

1035
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
topped with a raspberry
and white chocolate mousse.

1036
00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Perfect layers.

1037
00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

1038
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never had shiso in this form
and I can't really taste it,

1039
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the lemony flavour is fantastic.

1040
00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Try it with that.

1041
00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all chuckling]

1042
00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The sorbet's delicious
because it is so sharp.

1043
00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It hits you right at
the back of the tongue.

1044
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jelly's a little bit too rubbery.

1045
00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Drop it on the floor, it'd probably
bounce back up and hit me in the face.

1046
00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Michael, please bring up your Showstopper.

1047
00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. [chuckles]

1048
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks like something
straight from a 1970s sweet trolley.

1049
00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

1050
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It looks like the Queen Mum's hat
or something.

1051
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

1052
00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But let's see what this is like inside.

1053
00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, it's got a chocolate mousse,
a cherry jelly and a cherry cheesecake.

1054
00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

1055
00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Michael, the cheesecake is, erm, running.

1056
00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know whether
it's just not had time to set

1057
00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-or you didn't have the mixture right.
-Okay.

1058
00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It does taste like a Black Forest gateau.

1059
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The almond kicks in.

1060
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really like the jelly,
which has got terrific punch.

1061
00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think you've done
a great job with the flavours.

1062
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the overall look is a bit...

1063
00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A bit gaudy.
-Okay.

1064
00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles] It could've been worse.
-Nice.

1065
00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can go home happy now.

1066
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Beautiful.
-[Prue] Very beautiful.

1067
00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks as you would expect it to look.

1068
00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's tiramisu colours.

1069
00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sort of deliberate unevenness
of the steps are just perfect.

1070
00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I just hope that coffee is there
and all the beautiful

1071
00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-textures are in there as well.
-[Prue] And the rum.

1072
00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A lot of rum, yeah. [chuckles]

1073
00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is a layer of mocha mousse,

1074
00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
coffee-soaked génoise sponge,

1075
00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a pistachio-praline parfait.

1076
00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The layers are beautiful and delicate,
and it's held together nicely.

1077
00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, it's beautiful.

1078
00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's delicate, the coffee
is beautiful with the sponge.

1079
00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's lovely.
-[chuckles]

1080
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pistachio comes through
as a bit of texture as well.

1081
00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The whole thing's a triumph.

1082
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've made a tiramisu bombe. Well done.
-Thank you.

1083
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, Alice.

1084
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Priya] You can breathe, Alice.

1085
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You can breathe.
-[exhales]

1086
00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Priya, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper?

1087
00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it does look quite elegant.
The colours are nicely laid out.

1088
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I've got summer berry bavarois
and a chocolate mousse, raspberry sponge.

1089
00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sponge is actually baked beautifully.

1090
00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's still light, which is nice.
-[Prue] Mmm.

1091
00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice chocolate mousse.

1092
00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My only quarrel with the whole thing was
that the chocolate mousse is very sweet.

1093
00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The raspberry is not.

1094
00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It doesn't hold up against the chocolate.
-Okay.

1095
00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think if you can instruct diners to eat
first the bavarois and then the mousse,

1096
00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they'd be happy,
but not the other way around.

1097
00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1098
00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Thank you, Priya.

1099
00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales heavily]

1100
00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Henry, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

1101
00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's very simple, very elegant.

1102
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It looks like an igloo.
-Igloo.

1103
00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. [chuckles]

1104
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That's been scorched.

1105
00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry] Inside, it's a cinnamon sponge,

1106
00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and there are two layers
of a slightly-spiced honey mousse,

1107
00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and one layer of Bramley apple mousse.

1108
00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

1109
00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cake's a bit tough.

1110
00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hunting down the apple.

1111
00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you don't get the apple,

1112
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-all you get is cinnamon.
-Right.

1113
00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You needed something else in there as well
'cause it's a bit bland.

1114
00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the cake is very stodgy.

1115
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sort of disappointing.

1116
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[softly] You okay?

1117
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry sighs]

1118
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You seemed to be in your element today.

1119
00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes. Oh, I loved this.
-[Noel] You loved this.

1120
00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This was heaven.

1121
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But they started so badly with
the meringues that I was despairing,

1122
00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but anyway, they've pulled themselves up.
-[chuckles]

1123
00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I tell you what I found
most disappointing,

1124
00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
this is a baking competition,

1125
00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and both Rosie and Henry
made dreadful cakes.

1126
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Coming into this, Priya and Michael
were in a little bit of trouble,

1127
00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I think Rosie, and certainly Henry,

1128
00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
has fallen into that situation
where you end up with four people,

1129
00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you've got Priya, Michael,
Henry and Rosie are all in trouble.

1130
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The two moments when Prue most went "yum",

1131
00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
was the tiramisu by Alice, and Steph's.

1132
00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, Steph set the bar pretty high.

1133
00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought you were gonna
give her a handshake.

1134
00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was perfection.

1135
00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Right.
-I would say the same about Alice's.

1136
00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But Alice came first in Technical.

1137
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think both those two guys
are in line for Star Baker.

1138
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] What about David?
Could he not get Star Baker?

1139
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, he came second in Technical,

1140
00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and this is absolutely lovely.

1141
00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The only trouble is the jelly.

1142
00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The jelly was tough.
-Jelly was terrible.

1143
00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even I can make jelly.

1144
00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do you make bad jelly?

1145
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By putting too much gelatine in.

1146
00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'd probably use a packet
where it's all measured up for you.

1147
00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How dare you!
-[all laughing]

1148
00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And suspended fruit in it as well
at your birthday.

1149
00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How dare you tell the truth!
-This is unbelievable.

1150
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well done, bakers.
That's the end of dessert week.

1151
00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think I've ever heard
Prue say "yum" quite so many times,

1152
00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so well done.

1153
00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Er, it's my privilege and pleasure
to announce the Star Baker.

1154
00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Star Baker this week is...

1155
00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Steph.

1156
00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] You're so good, girl.

1157
00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You. You.

1158
00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

1159
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Doing it for the fringes.

1160
00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, bakers, unfortunately,
that means I've got the horrible job

1161
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of announcing the person who's going home,

1162
00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and this gets tougher and tougher.

1163
00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The person who's leaving us
this week is...

1164
00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Priya.
-[whispers] Oh.

1165
00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Priya] Oh.

1166
00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Girl.

1167
00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

1168
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1169
00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I've learnt so much, Paul.

1170
00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have. I've learnt so much.

1171
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's felt like such a privilege
to be in the tent and...

1172
00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs and stutters]
I want to make sure...

1173
00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course I'm gonna cry.
Of course I'll cry.

1174
00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I left work a year ago,
and I was kind of a bit stuck,

1175
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and I thought, "I'm just</i>
<i>gonna do the things that I enjoy."</i>

1176
00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>And do you know what it's meant?</i>

1177
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's meant to me that...

1178
00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if you just start with the things
that you really enjoy, you can't go wrong.

1179
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
God, I need to give her
a massive, massive hug now.

1180
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I spent the past hour before that</i>

1181
00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was fully prepped.

1182
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I knew what I was gonna nick
from the tent.

1183
00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I knew I was gonna nick the apron,
I was gonna get a spoon,

1184
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
maybe a bowl, a whisk.

1185
00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I was definitely flirting
with the bottom there, wasn't I?

1186
00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Giving the bottom
a cheeky wink. [chuckles]

1187

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was convinced that
Alice would've had that then.

1191
00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just like, "Oh, what?"

1192
00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hopefully now, three times in a row,

1193
00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
maybe it'll sink in how great she is.
