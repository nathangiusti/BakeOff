00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

of a sablé breton pastry

408
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
topped with raspberry confiture
and piped pistachio crème mousseline.

409
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It must be filled with fresh berries

410
00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and decorated with gilded meringue kisses
and chocolate curls.

411
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] You have two hours and 45 minutes.

412
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On your marks.

413
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get set.
-Bake.

414
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Ay, caramba.</i> Look at all this stuff.

415
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] I've heard of sablé breton.

416
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think, essentially,
we know what we're doing.

417
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I ain't got a clue what's going on.

418
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know anything they said
besides pistachio and fruit.

419
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Semi finals, then, Prue,
and you've chosen a sablé breton tart.

420
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's quite complicated, isn't it?
-It is.

421
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] They have to do
quite a lot of things.

422
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They've got to make a sablé breton bottom,

423
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is a very thick biscuit.

424
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then there's a thin layer
of raspberry confiture,

425
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
French for jam.

426
00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then mousseline
flavoured with pistachio.

427
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then the raspberries and strawberries,

428
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
meringue kisses,
and curls of tempered chocolate.

429
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So where could they go wrong with this?

430
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They might not understand
that this thing doesn't have sides.

431
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They just cut the pastry out,
plonk it in the tin to get that nice edge.

432
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. That could catch them out.

433
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And they have to watch
their setting and chilling.

434
00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That crème mousseline
really has to be thick enough

435
00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
not to run down the sides,
but soft enough to get the perfect shape.

436
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It almost looks like a sponge.

437
00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It does.

438
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's buttery and light
like a shortbread.

439
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not as sweet as a shortbread.
-No.

440
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gorgeous.
The French know what they're doing.

441
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] I know.
-Aren't they annoying?

442
00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do like the mousseline,
the texture's lovely, it's nice and light.

443
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not sure how the bakers
are going to deal with this.

444
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
From the sablé to the mousseline,

445
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
will they be able
to get their timings right? I don't know.

446
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it is the semi final.
We know they're very good.

447
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, let's go and see.

448
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I'm starting with the sablé dough,
'cause that needs to chill.

449
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The first step is,
"Whisk the egg yolks and caster sugar."

450
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Add softened butter,
and then the dry ingredients."

451
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is fancy butter,
it's Brittany butter.

452
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I suppose that's what makes
this breton tart a breton tart.

453
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just adding the dry ingredients.

454
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the key here
is just not to overwork the dough

455
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
like any shortcrust.

456
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] I do it by hand
because I can be gentler than the machine.

457
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want to keep the dough very short.

458
00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] That's the dough done, I think.

459
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, it says "chill." I don't know
if I should freeze or fridge it.

460
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I'm gonna put it in the fridge.
It says "chill," not freeze, so…

461
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay. Oh.
-[tray clatters]

462
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. That's step one done.

463
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Hello.
-[Jürgen] Hi, Noel.

464
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I just thought that was wrong.

465
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone getting a handshake
except for Jürgy-pops.

466
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I feel like you're strong enough…

467
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I should be--
-…to rise from the ashes.

468
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I should be able to.

469
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] I just thought I'd check in,
see if you're all right.

470
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You seem fine.

471
00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're not going to get caught up
in all the hysteria, are you?

472
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[speaking indistinctly]
-It's not your style.

473
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're the jazz baker.
-Hmm.

474
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just probably go back

475
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and play some Miles Davis
on your trombone, right?

476
00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Something like that.
-You, silhouetted against the moon--

477
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm gonna get some raspberries.
-Okay, bye-bye.

478
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sablé done. For meringue kisses,
make meringue.

479
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, so one medium egg white.

480
00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Probably should've used a smaller bowl.

481
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle chuckles]

482
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How is this looking?

483
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Still really runny.
I don't know if I'm doing this right.

484
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exclaims]

485
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks done.

486
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I might start again.

487
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just feel like that's not looking
like what a meringue should look like.

488
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe] I'm making these very small,

489
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause the smaller they are,
the quicker they will be to bake.

490
00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is there a piping nozzle here?
Have they given us a nozzle?

491
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nope.

492
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] This looks more like
the meringue we know and love.

493
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] Can't fit any more on.
Let's go.

494
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These are gonna take about--

495
00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know. I'll have to keep checking.

496
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, meringue kisses are done.
Right. Make the raspberry confiture.

497
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, it's a piping nozzle
to make the meringue kisses.

498
00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now they're in the oven,
I can't do anything about it.

499
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right. Step number three,
we make the raspberry confiture.

500
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Raspberry confiture.
Am I saying that right? "Confiture."

501
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Raspberries, jam sugar and pectin.

502
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's just jam. Right?

503
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Confiture is like a jam,
but it's got bits of fruit.

504
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit more rustic.

505
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, okay.
"Make pistachio paste and use--"

506
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

507
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Use to make pistachio crème mousseline."

508
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crème mousselini. Right. Erm--

509
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] Crème mousseline is crème pat,
with additional butter.

510
00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got my egg yolks,
flour and sugar here.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'm just tempering this
with vanilla-infused milk.

512
00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is done.

513
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
While it's still warm,
I think I put the butter in.

514
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just going to make sure
that butter all melts into there.

515
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hey, Matt, how's it going? Good?
-Good, thanks.

516
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How's it going for you?
-Yeah, all right.

517
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm making some sort of crème mousseline.

518
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Named after the, er,
Italian dictator Mussolini.

519
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But that's what I thought,
it was called crème Mussolini.

520
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They said, "No, Chigs, that's wrong."
-Yeah.

521
00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How'd you feel about the handshake?

522
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it was good. I was happy. And then--

523
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Everyone else got one.
-[Chigs] Crystelle got one.

524
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then he got one.

525
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's extraordinary. I don't think
that's ever happened in the tent.

526
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Never?
-I don't think so.

527
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't watch this show.
-[laughs]

528
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I watch the other side.

529
00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs laughing] Good.

530
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm assuming that's the right stage
to add the pistachio paste.

531
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, it doesn't say how much to put in.

532
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] I added my pistachios
to the crème mousseline.

533
00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That is looking good.
-[Chigs] Whack it all in.

534
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They want pistachio taste,
I'll give them pistachio.

535
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] Looks good to me.
Certainly green.

536
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, oh! Tastes really pistachio-y.

537
00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] Just needs to chill now.
I'll pop this in the fridge.

538
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you are halfway through.

539
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Approaching one hour

540
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that the meringue kisses
have been in the oven.

541
00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gonna take them out.

542
00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't want them to brown.
Ah, there we go. They're done.

543
00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe] They're perfectly baked.

544
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They, er, look good.

545
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not really French patisserie, is it,
that colour?

546
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're not supposed to be
brown like that.

547
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, my God, look at Jürgen's. Perfect.
-[Jürgen] I'm happy with them. Next step.

548
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Roll and cut the sablé dough
to fit the tin."

549
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] I'm assuming this dough
is gonna have to be really thin.

550
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just trying to gauge
if the tart needs sides.

551
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It just says, "Roll out the sablé dough
and fit it in the tin."

552
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just don't know if
it's supposed to be a sideless pastry.

553
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just don't know.

554
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you go up the sides?
Or just put it in the bottom?

555
00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sablé breton is usually baked
as a thick layer,

556
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as far as I remember.

557
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not gonna do the sides.

558
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna roll it out
so it just fits the circle.

559
00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

560
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This dough melts literally in your hands.

561
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. We're in.

562
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] I expect that
to bake for 25 minutes.

563
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna say, this thickness,
about 20 minutes.

564
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm gonna be heating this
at least 20 minutes.

565
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, I hope
that was the right thing to do.

566
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But it's in now.
-[Chigs] What was I gonna do now?

567
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Er, chocolate.

568
00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"For chocolate decorations,
using the acetate rectangles,

569
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the long edge of the chocolate cone,

570
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and narrow glass to make chocolate curls."

571
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, tempering chocolate.
I can do that that.

572
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. That needs to melt.

573
00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the bit. This is the magic.
Watch this.

574
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Little prayer to the chocolate god.

575
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please!

576
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And I'm not gonna touch it.
-Please make me good.

577
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't want the wrath of Paul Hollywood.

578
00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at that. Boom.

579
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well for now, so good so far.
-[Noel smacks lips]

580
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Give me a shout
when you're gonna put that in there

581
00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause I want to see that.

582
00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Chigs] Come on.
-[Crystelle] That looks okay, actually.

583
00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] What the hell?
-[Giuseppe] Look at that.

584
00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were supposed to call me back.
We had a deal, an agreement.

585
00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sorry. I'm multitasking already.
-You forgot me, didn't you?

586
00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What do you think?
-Yeah, I liked it.

587
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'd have liked it more
if you'd have let me watch.

588
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's had 20 minutes. Yeah.

589
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle groans] Oh, man.

590
00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sides have collapsed in.

591
00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Quite frankly,
that is not patisserie standard.

592
00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] I think it's looking good.

593
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs to be golden,
like a nice shortbread.

594
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. Do I stick this in the freezer?
'Cause it needs to chill.

595
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want to cool this very quickly

596
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so that I can put the fillings
and the decorations on it.

597
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

598
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"To assemble, spread remaining
confiture over the sablé base…"

599
00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"…leaving a one-centimetre pastry border."

600
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe] This looks delicious.

601
00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] Just a massive
Jammie Dodger, innit?

602
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Pipe the pistachio crème mousseline
over the confiture and chill."

603
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] All right, I'm gonna wait
because this has not set yet.

604
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe] Ooh. It's very thick.

605
00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] So I'm gonna do
just big fat stars.

606
00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

607
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe exclaims] Oh, careful.

608
00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. I need to chill this again.
How long do we have?

609
00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

610
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think I have time.
I should just start assembling.

611
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now the question is,
should I go for a pattern?

612
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it should be
a fairly random arrangement.

613
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll just put it on.
Nothing I can do about it.

[Chigs] Ah, I'm losing all the definition.
It's turning into liquid.

[Crystelle] Surely that's enough
strawberries for that tiny little tart.

Everything's just oozing back out.
This needs to go in the fridge again.

621
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe] Meringues. Let's get gilding.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Can you see I'm shrinking?

624
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, this is going from bad to worse.

625
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

626
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs laughing] It looks a mess.

627
00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can do this. I can do this.

628
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] This doesn't
look like French patisserie.

629
00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do I pipe more?
Maybe I'll just do a little.

630
00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

632
00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

647
00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a little bit dense on the biscuit,
but it does taste quite nice.

648
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Moving on. From the mousseline upwards,
that looks good.

649
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

650
00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That looks a bit overbaked.

651
00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Let's have a look.
I think it is slightly overbaked.

652
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Actually, it tastes quite good.

653
00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything else is good.
I'm just not happy with that biscuit.

654
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The mousseline on this
is terrible on number three.

655
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And those meringue kisses
are not well piped.

656
00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that mousseline
has not set at all has it?

657
00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is not a proper biscuit base,
it's a bit soft.

658
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

659
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Not helped by very wet mousseline,
which will make it soggy anyway.

660
00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

little Italian kisses.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

665
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

671
00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But besides that, it's fine.

674
00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In third place, we have this one.

675
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Crystelle, the biscuit is a little thin,
but the flavour's nice.

676
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In second, we have this one.

677
00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Whose is this?
-That's me.

678
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Giuseppe, the sablé was far too thin,
but the overall appearance was quite nice.

679
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which means, Jürgen, the biscuit base
is a fraction overbaked,

680
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but otherwise it's a very good sablé.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

686
00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

688
00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

693
00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

697
00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

765
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need to make sure the entremets set.
Need to take them out of the moulds.

926
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

960
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have

this is going to be super tight.

962
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

963
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just suddenly realised I have a lot to do
and really not a lot of time.

964

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] So I'm doing pine cones,
roses, leaves, made out of butter cream.

966

981
00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1007
00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

It's just amazing. It's leaning
more than the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

wonkier than it is.

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These look fairly straightforward
on the outside.

1027
00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the work, of course,
with an entremet, is on the inside.

1028
00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Paul] Oh, lovely.

1029
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Beautiful green.
-[Matt] Hmm.

1030
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The bavarois is very delicious,

1031
00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the pine nut's
not coming through very well.

1032
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, okay.

1033
00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Without that cherry,
you really would be hunting for flavours.

1034
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Having said that,
all your textures are spot-on.

1035
00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1036
00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Well done.

1037
00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] Well done, Giuseppe.

1038
00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's very impressive.
-Thank you.

1039
00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm knocked back by the purple colour.
They look more like a plums.

1040
00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I should've put
more red colouring in the glaze.

1041
00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Pink ladies, that's what they are.
-Yeah, right.

1042
00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love that they're sitting on a biscuit.

1043
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the biscuit looks well baked as well.

1044
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

1045
00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's exceptional.
-[chuckles nervously]

1046
00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your apple
has got a little tartness to it.

1047
00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can taste the caramel
in the bavarois as well.

1048
00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you have that slight
bitterness from the chocolate.

1049
00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you've got all the flavours
correctly balanced

1050
00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to create an apple scene with the tree.

1051
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've really been
on a journey, haven't you?

1052
00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You started baking last year.

1053
00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look what you've done.
That is very, very, very good.

1054
00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Chigs] Thank you, Paul.
-[Prue] Thanks, Chigs.

1055
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Thank you very much.

1056
00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Well done, Chigs.

1057
00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs exhales]

1058
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe, whispering]
Come on, you smashed it.

1059
00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's stunning.
-[Prue] Love the colours.

1060
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it was in the middle
of a wedding table,

1061
00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
all eyes would be upon it.

1062
00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] What I'm interested in
is those entremets,

1063
00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they look like works of arts.

1064
00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm.

1065
00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That, Crystelle, is flawless.

1066
00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] I don't know what I can say.
-It's just beautiful.

1067
00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The passion fruit is really strong.
The mango much silkier. It is lovely.

1068
00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Absolutely lovely.
-Thank you. Sorry.

1069
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue laughing]

1070
00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Crystelle.
-Thank you so much.

1071
00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Well done.

1072
00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you so much.

1073
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] It's really emotional

1074
00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it always means more
to, erm, get good comments

1075
00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
on a bake that means a lot to you,
that's dedicated to someone. Erm,

1076
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[voice breaking]
so I'm just really proud of myself.

1077
00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] I'm speechless at the moment

1078
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and a little taken aback
by the comments they've given me.

1079
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I was to go out now,
I could walk out smiling.

1080
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know how they're going to call it.

1081
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yesterday, there were three handshakes
and I won the Technical.

1082
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And, today, all these
very positive comments.

1083
00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There were four Star Bakers in there.

1084
00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Simple as that.

1085
00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] We've become friends
over almost two months.

1086
00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are very proud of each other.

1087
00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As a collective, we've done very well.

1088
00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know what's gonna happen.
It's a very, very close call.

1089
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] Wow. There are four really
impressive bakers in this tent.

1090
00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do not envy you the task
of having to separate them.

1091
00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's almost unique,
we're picking the worst of the best.

1092
00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It really is difficult
because all of them tasted fantastic.

1093
00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crystelle.

1094
00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at the layers in that.
The coconut biscuit.

1095
00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] The glaze is stunning.
-[Prue] Yes.

1096
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And Chigs, look
at the amount of skill in that.

1097
00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a biscuit, a crumble.

1098
00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a wonderful chocolate case,
which is not easy to do.

1099
00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Jürgen was clever
with the matcha and the raspberry.

1100
00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A bit boring to look at.
-And then you come down to Giuseppe.

1101
00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My only complaint with this.

1102
00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I love the beautiful colour.
-So neat.

1103
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] And the cherry is fantastic.

1104
00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My only complaint?
I couldn't taste the pine nut.

1105
00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] So we're
in a very unusual position, where--

1106
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could argue for any one of these.

1107
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the worst time to go home as well,
so it's horrible.

1108
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, it is. It's really hard.

1109
00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know
how you're gonna make this decision.

1110
00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Ah, bakers,

1111
00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this is such a precarious point
in the competition.

1112
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously,
everyone wants to get to the final

1113
00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's so close at this point,
it's just crazy.

1114
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got the amazing job
of announcing Star Baker.

1115
00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The person who is Star Baker is…

1116
00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crystelle.

1117
00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle gasps]

1118
00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, my God.
-[Chigs] Why are you surprised?

1119
00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you so surprised?

1120
00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, my God.
-[Chigs] You just smashed it.

1121
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Okay.

1122
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm afraid to say

1123
00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that the person who will not
be making it into the final,

1124
00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and who will be going home is…

1125
00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jürgen.

1126
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

1127
00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] What?

1128
00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
