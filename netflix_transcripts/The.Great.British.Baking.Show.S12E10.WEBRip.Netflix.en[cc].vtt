-What is that for?
-It's a pastry brush.

513
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a strawberry caresser.

514
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[in creepy voice] Oh, yeah, that.

515
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Noel, what's going on?

516
00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Georgie] I'm going onto the sponges.

517
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Creaming together
the butter and the sugar.

518
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just do the tart cases.
Create a little shaggy dough.

519
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll weigh this
'cause I'll have to divide.

[Alison] <i>Each one of Prue's lemon cakes</i>

521
00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're sandwiched,
so you need eight sponges.

522
00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, let's pop these babies in.

523
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

524
00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll do ten minutes to start off with.

525
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll check again at six minutes.

[Dylan] Those cupcakes look awful.
Don't know why they've sunk in the middle.

528
00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll just remake them. [grunts]

529
00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bakers, you are halfway through.
-[timer beeps]

530
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That went quick.
-[Christiaan] See how they are doing.

531
00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] I might have
slightly overbaked them.

532
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cakes are doing it again.
They've just mushroomed out. Failed again.

533
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So annoying. I'm losing my mind.

534
00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Babes, you've got this.
You're normally really good at this stuff.

535
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Dylan] Everything's going wrong.
-Aw, I don't like seeing my Dylan low.

536
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give me a piggyback. Let's cheer you up.

537
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

538
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll roll my pastry out, cut the shapes.

539
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan]
I should've rolled it thinner.

540
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They should turn out really pretty
if they're done okay.

541
00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[whispers] Why won't this--
I just keep tearing the pastry.

542
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need to bake my pastry shells.
Put these in for ten minutes to start.

543
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

544
00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you've got an hour left.

545
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's get on with this bread.

546
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Definitely doubled in size. Out of this,
we are making four plaited rolls.

547
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it's a five-stranded plait.

548
00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't remember how Paul did
that plait he did. Ding-ding-ding.

549
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Move to the middle.
This one to the middle.

550
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll keep saying it.
This one to the middle.

551
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can't remember how to do this.

552
00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One over two… [groans]

553
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan] So we've got two here,
got two more to do.

554
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Er, this is the last one. Who does this?

555
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've done this twice,
and every time I've done it different.

556
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my days.

557
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, look at our Christiaan
doing his little plaiting.

558
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a little bit like an art project.
-Look at that.

559
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Think that's right.
I honestly have no clue any more.

560
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do they have to prove?
-I'll put these in to prove.

561
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They should take about 20 to 30 minutes.

562
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[timer beeping]
-Oh, who are you?

563
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right, let's take
these babies out for now.

564
00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dylan] So, they've shrunk a bit.

565
00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I think they're all right.
Golden-ish.

566
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Georgie] Ah, God. Definitely overbaked.

567
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hopefully, the filling will save it.

568
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go. Action.

569
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you've got half an hour left.

570
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My bread has proved nicely.

571
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] It looks terrible,
none of them look equal.

572
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So egg wash and then Nigella seeds on top.

573
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I might egg wash my whole house.

574
00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, no, don't.
-Why not?

575
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you tried?
-No. We've got pebbledash.

576
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
People did it before because it was
all the rage in I think it was the '80s?

577
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've said so many things in your accent
that blow my mind.

578
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Was it?
-"All the rage."

579
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] All right, let's bake them.
Ten minutes.

580
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So this is the lemon curd for the cake.

581
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] The curd is ready here.
Can I switch sides?

582
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] Yeah, go on.
-[vocalises]

583
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

584
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan] I'm just
gonna chill this curd.

585
00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bread rolls are ready.

586
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They felt right but don't look great.
-Got a nice golden colour.

587
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] Bakers,
you've got ten minutes left.

588
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got ten minutes to go.
It's the final.

589
00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[mimics lasers]
I'm gonna make the egg mayo.

590
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've cooked my eggs soft-boiled.
Gah! [laughs]

591
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ugh! I don't know whether I'm meant
to chop it or what. It's disgusting.

592
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Start decorating and assembling.

593
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] Wish I had my tweezers.
It's so hard.

594
00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Georgie] Going on to sponges.

595
00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] I'll cut them in half.
I can make these look all right.

596
00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the mascarpone cream cheese.

597
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Doing a little dam around
and then filling it with the curd.

598
00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's move on to strawberry tarts.
Don't know how they should look.

599
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] I don't know
how to decorate these.

600
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got one minute left.

-Ah!
-[Dylan] Why does everything look ugly?

602
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to get my head sorted.

603
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is stressing me out.
I don't know how they want them.

604
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look a mess.

605
00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] Feels like everything
turned out wrong.

606
00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] I don't wanna touch these tarts
any more. Getting on my nerves.

607
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Everything's so bad today. [sighs]

-Yeah.

617
00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a shame they didn't cut it open
and put the egg in

618
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause you wanna show off what the filling
is rather than cutting it on the side.

I mean, it's quite pretty.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

633
00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-Let's look at these tarts.

635
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not convinced of that layout.

636
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

638
00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Slightly overbaked.

642
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's why you struggle
when you cut it. Literally…

643
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue] A bit uneven.

-The plaiting wasn't perfect.

646
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The plaiting was terrible. [laughs]

647
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's baked okay but it's a little dense.

648
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The dough is just too tight.

649
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Right, the pastry's a bit rough.
-[Prue] And it's too thick.

650
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think it's been done in a hurry.
-[Paul] Yeah. Moving on.

651
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] The sponge looks uneven.
-Yeah. It's the way it's been cut.

652
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flavour's lovely. Lemon curd's good.

653
00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] That sponge's a little ropey.
-But this… Mmm.

654
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not good.
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.

657
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dylan, your bread wasn't very good,
there was no height in the strawberries,

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Georgie, not too bad.
I quite like these, little bit overbaked.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

that this is in first place.

665
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It always comes down
to the showstopper. Anyone could win it.

672
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's so disheartening.
I've done so badly in both the challenges.

[Paul] Looking over the two challenges,

684
00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Georgie and Christiaan

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

his nose in front.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But let's be honest, Dylan has messed up.

690
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

691
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dylan's very young
and he cares so much about baking.

692
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

he's quite emotional and can't hide it.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

694
00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, of course she can.
All of these three could win.

695
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dylan could come back with a blinder.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think, going into the final showstopper,

697
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Paul] The critical thing is,
what sponge do you use?

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

732
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

817
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In the Netherlands, we love our liquorice.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dylan] Right, let's move.

819
00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At home they take 38 minutes,

820
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they'll take longer here,
I'll check them.

821
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm worried about them.

822
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The batter just wasn't
as nice as it always is.

823
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There were a few lumps.
I hope it's all right.

824
00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[vocalises] Georgie…
[in normal voice] How are you?

825
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Georgie] All right.
-What's happening?

826
00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm hyper today. Hyper-focussed, frantic.

827
00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Are you?
-Yeah. I'm ADHD.

828
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yeah.

829
00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, so this is you
in full ADHD concentrating.

830
00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

831
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then I pop from one diagram
to the other

832
00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then I cut off each branch.

833
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think, "She's nailing this."
-Yes.

834
00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Then I go to walk away…
-[laughs]

835
00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
…and you're thinking about the Pope.

836
00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's usually how it works.
Something pops in your head.

837
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thinking about juggling.

838
00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what it's like. [laughs]

840
00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So these cakes are coming out the oven
in about two seconds.

841
00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[timer beeps]
-There we go.

842
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're looking okay.

843
00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bakes in the technical were overbaked
so I really wanna get these ones right.

844
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Christiaan] These look nice.

845
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] I'm making
my Earl Grey buttercreams.

846
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Got my candied oranges on the hob.
The sponges are in the oven.

847
00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, come on, come on, please bake.

848
00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Georgie] I need to get my curd underway.

849
00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want this quite sharp
'cause it's a sweet cake,

850
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so we want this to be… [whistles]

851
00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So here I've got the French buttercream.

852
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't want lemon thyme leaves
in there, but you want the flavour.

853
00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Georgie] Oh.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Georgie] Looks a bit over.

856
00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm cutting the tops and bottoms off
anyway so it should be okay.

857
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

858
00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Crazy, innit, might be the last cakes
I'm baking unless they go wrong.

859
00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] <i>…for Dylan's genoise,</i>

860
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Small ones don't look right.

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dylan] They all have clumps of flour.

863
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew it going in.

864
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had a feeling it would be bad
and it was.

865
00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you are halfway through.

866

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Christiaan] Let's get these out.

868
00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These bottom ones
are a little bit lighter.

869
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I might just give the whole thing
two more minutes.

870
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm cutting the tops off.

871
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This can soak into the cake,
the strawberry-lemonade syrup.

872
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

873
00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're not nervous or anxious. [laughs]

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] This is the filling.
Mascarpone Chantilly.

-[Christiaan] Raspberry and liquorice jam.
-I don't like liquorice.

878
00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you need to taste this.

879
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-You know me.

881
00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] So this is the curd.
And the confit.

882
00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Some people like thin cakes, lots of it.

883
00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I prefer big wedge of cake,
big wedge of filling.

[Dylan] The problem is at the bottom.

886
00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can see these clumps of flour.
If I cut them out, the top should be fine.

887
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna have to use those

888
00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I'm making more
of the small cakes as well.

889
00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm worried about time.

890
00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you've got one hour left.

891
00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan] I don't wanna jinx it

892
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the final hour, I want to just be
finishing touches, decoration

894
00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan] In terms of design,
I'll go abstract.

906
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-[Paul] I like the candied orange.

1027
00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It does work well
with the Earl Grey and the sponge.

1028
00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've got quite a concertinaed sponge.
-[Dylan] Yeah.

1029
00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know I think the candied orange
works so well, but you needed more of it.

1030
00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] When you get the candied orange
and the Earl Grey sponge, it's delicious.

1031
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you look at the levels on this
where you've got an inch of mascarpone…

1032
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Dylan] Yeah.
-[Paul] The same there,

1033
00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they're barely a quarter of an inch.
It's not well balanced.

1034
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was this because it was a rush?

1035
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The top one was the last one.
I tried to get it out quickly.

1036
00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You were in a hurry.
-Yeah.

1037
00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But nevertheless, fascinating work.

1038
00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Dylan.
-[Prue] Well done.

1039
00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is your tongue blue?
-Yes.

1040
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is.
-[all laughing]

1041
00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughter]

1042
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Take it away.
-[all laughing]

1043
00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, babe.

1044
00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Cheers.
-[Christiaan] Well done.

1045
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Georgie, ready for your showstopper?

1046
00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-As I'll ever be.
-[Alison] Let's do it.

1047
00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Oh, my God.

1048
00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is scary as hell.
-[Georgie] Yeah. Ooh.

1049
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] There you go.
-[Georgie] Okay.

1050
00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, Georgie, tell us about
this magnificent showstopper.

1051
00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My cake is inspired by summer gardens.

1052
00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a lemon sponge
with champagne and elderflower mascarpone,

1053
00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
lemon curd and strawberry confit.

1054
00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, it says summer, doesn't it?
-[Paul] Mmm.

1055
00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's so pretty.

1056
00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You did an amazing job
with the stencil work.

1057
00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the piping with the buttercream
looks great.

1058
00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Beautiful. Anyway.
-[Paul] Right.

1059
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Look at that.

1060
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] That's an impressive wedge
to come out of that cake.

1061
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you've done an all-in-one sponge?

1062
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Creamed.

1063
00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] They look well baked.
-[Prue] They look beautiful.

1064
00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is utterly delicious.

1065
00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckling] Oh, thank you.

1066
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's like a trifle.
-[Prue] It is.

1067
00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because it's got so much lovely filling.

1068
00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The elderflower works really nicely in it.
The sponge is baked nice and even.

1069
00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The filling is lovely,
the mascarpone is soft and luxurious

1070
00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it complements
the sharpness of the lemon.

1071
00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If someone gave me that at a summer party,
I'd be a happy man.

1072
00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh. Absolutely delicious.
-Aw. Thank you.

1073
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Well done, Georgie.

1074
00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[whispers] Well done.
-[Georgie] Thank you.

1075
00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Smashed it.

1076
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, guys.

1077
00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Christiaan, it's showstopper time.

1078
00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Look at that little beauty.

1079
00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Christiaan] Yeah…
-[whispering] Let's go slow, go slow.

1080
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispered muttering]

1081
00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Christiaan, remind us
about your showstopper.

1082
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So my showstopper cake
is poppyseeds, lemon thyme,

1083
00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a lemon and olive oil sponge

1084
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with lemon thyme French buttercream
and a raspberry and liquorice jam.

1085
00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

1086
00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

1087
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The design is wonderful.
-Love this layer here.

1088
00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This layer doesn't look quite as polished

1089
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-as the top bit.
-No.

1090
00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] Oh, wow.
-[Prue] Look at that.

1091
00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Great-looking slice.

1092
00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never tasted
anything like that before.

1093
00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The liquorice with the raspberry,
it's unusual,

1094
00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but that's not the first time
you've done unusual.

1095
00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like all the flavours,
but I think they're all a mite too strong.

1096
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I never thought I'd say this

1097
00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I'm always
asking for punchier flavour,

1098
00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it's almost too concentrated.

1099
00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's delicious in a tiny bit,

1100
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I don't think
you could eat a whole slice.

1101
00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I think it's slightly overbaked.

1102
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The idea, though, I love it.
That's very Christiaan.

1103
00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done. Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

1104
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, my darling.

1105
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan] I'm a bit overwhelmed.
I feel a bit numb.

1106
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course it would be lovely to win,

1107
00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but not everything
was exactly as I wanted it

1108
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in terms of flavour, in terms of shape.

1109
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] I think
I did everything I could.

1110
00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I still honestly
don't know who could win it

1111
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because I had a bad day yesterday.

1112
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, it could be… it still could be anyone.

1113
00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dylan] Those two are just so talented.

1114
00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's crazy, I think I'm just really
humbled from that challenge.

1115
00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I tried my best this week,
even if everything didn't go to plan.

1116
00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But theirs were amazing.

1117
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's between Christiaan and Georgie.
I think I'm out of it.

1118

Three incredible cakes.

very brave.
