00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We cannot risk having that happen again.
It was a disaster. Give me that.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
so let's go for nailing
a good signature today.

33
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

34
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

42
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I just literally drink a glass of milk
in the morning.

43
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, as you all know, unfortunately,
Terry is not with us today

45
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because he is poorly,

46
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but with the agreement
of absolutely everybody,

47
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he is going to be allowed
to come back next week.

48
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, on with the challenge.

to make a meringue roulade.

50
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, your roulade
needs to be family-sized.

51
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and must be made
from melt-in-the-mouth meringue.

52
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] The choice of filling?
Entirely up to you, but the filling

53
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

54
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which, when cut,
must demonstrate a perfect swirl.

55
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

you need to concentrate on.

61
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Karen] I've managed to get the egg whites

62
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in the bowl
without getting any egg yolk in.

63
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was the first hurdle, passed.

64
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

You need a bit of acidity,

71
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

73
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

there's nowhere to hide.

74
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

So, how are you making your meringue?

83
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

84
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Basically just dissolves much quicker
in the egg whites.

85
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

202
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So this is like
one of the first British flavour

203
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that I've grown into liking.

[Sandi] <i>Rahul will roll</i>
<i>a classic rich-cream custard </i>

205
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and rhubarb compote</i>

206
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you not win star baker twice in a row?

207
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God. Do you have to say that?

208
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you can get three in a row.

209
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not thinking that, you know.

210
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] If you get three in a row,

211
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna get on your shoulders
and you carry me round the tent, yeah?

212
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, that's definitely, probably
not gonna happen, after you said that.

213
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you get a box of chocolates
at Christmas in the family,

214
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
coffee creams and hazelnut pralines
always go first in our house.

215
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I've tried to base the flavours
on that, really.

216
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

218
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Karen] This is a very thick custard.
If it's sloppy, it will just ooze out.

219
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's fine.

220
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Curd's done.

221
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just gonna go in the fridge.

222
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you are halfway through
your signature challenge.

223
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have 52 and a half minutes left.

224
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan laughs] That's oddly specific.

225
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm looking for a crispy coating
with a nice creamy centre.

226
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's rising. He's rising.

227
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Two or three minutes till the meringue
comes out the oven.

228
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I'm taking it out now.

229
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Coming out in, like, four minutes.

230
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just hope
it's not going to crack too much.

231
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna go for two minutes more,
and then he's coming out.

232
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Karen] Okay. Are we ready?

233
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The whole tray's coming out.
I can't get that out.

234
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jon] Pretty good. Quite pleased with it.

235
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Definitely a meringue.

236
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look how lovely that looks.

237
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Dan] What can I say? It's called talent.
-[Ruby laughs]

238
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a few holes and that,
but it's a roulade. It'll roll up.

239
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're gonna let this bad boy
cool a little bit.

240
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] How are you?
[Dan] I'm all right.

241
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But no star baker yet?

242
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, all right, don't rub it in.

243
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you must be...

244
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, no.
-...so close.

245
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm... Yeah, well, I'm not getting
excited about it anymore.

246
00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I know.

247
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That little guy.
-I know.

248
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] He stands
before you and a star baker.

249
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think when people think
who's doing well, they think of you...

250
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do they?
-...and they think of me.

251
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] Right.

252
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have...

253
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Half an hour left. Half an hour.

254
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] I'm just going to
spread my custard.

255
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Karen] Just gotta be careful.
I don't want to overload it.

256
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just leaving a gap at the top
'cause it inevitably, like, squidges out.

257
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] I like to use a lot of cream.

258
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want them to taste rhubarb.
Not too thick, though.

259
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want each bite to have some kirsch
and some amarene.

260
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] Just gotta do the dreaded roll.

261
00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, that's the moment, isn't it?
Where it suddenly might go...

262
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's the big...
-Ugh!

263
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, ugh.
-Ugh.

264
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You want a nice, tight swirl.

265
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just like a little cut here,
just to get things rolling.

266
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jon] I use the technique called 'hope'.

267
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Right, let's go for it.

268
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jon] This is the crucial moment
to get right.

269
00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

270
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God, it's so important.

[Kim-Joy] I hope that's tight enough.

273
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

277
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh. Nice little roll.

278
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

279
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And breathe.

280
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Manon] Oh. No.

281
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It cracked.

282
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop moving.

Bakers, you have ten minutes.
Just ten minutes.

285
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A bit of leakage out the side,

286
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but neaten it up a little bit
with some nice, pretty, piping.

287
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jon] I'm terrible at piping.

288
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just cover up...
-Yes.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-...the crack.
-Okay. Cool.

290
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're gonna put some cherries on top.

291
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is total improvisation.

292
00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just need to decorate it.

293
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] Ahh! Really shaky.

294
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Finally, baking at my level.

295

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rahul] It's the rhubarb compote.

297
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why are you down here?
-It's easier. [laughs]

298
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I've found that my whole life.
-[laughing]

299
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the runniest toffee sauce.
A few more for good luck.

300
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Don't take this the wrong way...

301
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] Oh, for God's sake.

302
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I saw a caterpillar in the zoo,
an exotic one...

303
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

304
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looked a bit like that.

305
00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've sort of got a fold
rather than a swirl.

339
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps it should have been
just a bit tighter.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's a real mixture
of absolutely exquisite piping,

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

353
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's very thick.
There is no spiral in there at all.

354
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think the answer
is to have a thinner meringue...

357
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

358
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Looks very busy. It looks very neat.
Can't wait to see what the spiral's like.

359
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's broken up a lot. That's a shame.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What you've got is a massive meringue
with a little fold.

369
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think your roulade looks pretty sad.

377
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's flat.

378
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Paul] Let's have a look

379
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
at this, shall we?

380
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The actual swirl is there,
but the inside is so soft

381
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-that it's all collapsed.
-[Paul] Yeah.

382
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think your meringue's
slightly underdone.

383
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ah.
-Your outside is the only crispy bit

384
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in there. Everything else in there
is soft and marshmallowy.

385
00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

and it does look neat as a pin.

387
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You do have a spiral.

389
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

390
00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:14.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really fresh, lots of different fruit,

391
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the lime cuts right through
the sweetness of the meringue

392
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you've got the balance perfectly.

393
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

407
00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

408
00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

tastes like treacle tart.

Right, bakers,
time for your technical challenge,

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

442
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

443
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, no, they're still baking,

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

445
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

447
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, Prue would love you to make
that retro-classic, the blancmange.

449
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

450
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Yes, it's blancmange,
but it's not blancmange out of a packet.

467
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

468
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the colour and the flavour

474
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] They're using gelatine to set this,

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

476
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because they've only got
two and a half hours,

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

478
00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

480
00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

487
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

activates it. It's called blooming.

The only thing I know about it, Sandi,
is that it looks like a brain.

516
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, okay.
-I think.

517
00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's quite interesting. Yes.

518
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is all I've got, I'm afraid.

519
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is that the look you're going for?
A bit of cerebral cortex?

520
00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] Then, "Pour into the mould."

521
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Easy as that.

522
00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The concern is,
how does it come out of the mould?

523
00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I'll worry about that later.

524
00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] Here we go. I'm scared.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] Ahh!

526
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Briony] Right, I need to get this bad-boy
in the freezer.

527
00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where is my freezer?

528
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh! Do your thing.

529
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One hour.

530
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] We've got to freeze the blancmange
for an hour,

531
00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then we've got to put it in the fridge
for another hour

532
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
before we turn it out.
Really cutting that fine for time.

533
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um, make the <i>langues de chat.</i>

534
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jon] I don't know
what <i>langues de chat</i> means though.

535
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

536
00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, the cat's tongue.

537
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know what a <i>langues de chat</i> is?

538
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it's a cat's tongue.

540
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've made <i>langues de chat</i> before.

541
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know what they're supposed to look like.

542
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

543
00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why does everyone know what these are?

544
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It just says,
"Make the <i>langues de chat</i> mixture."

545
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No method.
It's just a list of ingredients.

546
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Icing sugar, plain flour, salt, extract,
egg-whites. Boom.

547
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just got to pipe it and bake it now.

548
00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] I'm quite happy with this batter.

549
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's what I remember
the batter looking like.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't look at me, Rubes. No cheating.

551
00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're such a little tell-tale.
No-one likes that.

I'm going five centimetres. Ooh.

555
00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just want them to all be identical.

556
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So does it say how long?
No. Just says, "Bake."

557
00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, go.

[Karen] Bake till Christmas?

Thanks, Prue.

560
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think they're probably only gonna
need a few minutes.

561

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Haven't got a clue.

563
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Oh, that's the cat's tongue.

564
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Manon] Yeah, that's the cat's tongue.

565
00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's all you eat in France, isn't it?
Cats' tongues and coffee.

566
00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

567
00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

"Melt the white chocolate."

571
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's really hard to tell
how the blancmange is looking.

575

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

melts away to reveal the dessert within.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pressure's on because
it's such a complicated dessert.

768
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

as soon as possible.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What we're asking for
is the most delicious,

776
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

778
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you want the chocolate to melt away

779
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There lies the problem.

780
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's too thick, it's not gonna melt
all the way through.

781
00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's too thin, the chances are
it's gonna crack and fall apart anyway.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's gotta blend well
with the chocolate and the sauce.

784
00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One, the dessert's gotta be fantastic.

786
00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But also, you've got to think</i>
<i>of the flavours </i>

787
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when that chocolate and sauce
is added to it.

788
00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

793
00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

The shine you've got on it,

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the tempering of the chocolate,

1078
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1079
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause the flavour combinations

1084
00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Do you understand the word "sphere"?

1088
00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What happened was, it had shattered
into so many pieces,

1089
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I had to do a bit of a jigsaw
to try and have something.

1090
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Nice reveal.

1091
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are all my favourite flavours.
Pistachio. Passion fruit.

1092
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's very thick,
the walls of that tart.

1093
00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Too thick.

1094
00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite sickly.

1095
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] There's too much pistachio
which dries everything out.

1096
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very difficult to eat,

1097
00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-if I'm honest.
-Right, okay.

1098
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] We only wanted one globe,
you've done two,

1099
00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it's very elegant.

1100
00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very Rahul.

1101
00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1102
00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's beautiful.

1103
00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Remind me what's in the sauce?

1104
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rahul] Oh, it's coffee crème anglaise.

1105
00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you first put it on the top, and then
it's slowly going to melt the rest.

1106
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope.

1107
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so sorry.

1108
00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It probably needed more sauce.

1109
00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's quite strong, isn't it?

1110
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] You should have, like,
seven-layer opera cake.

1111
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Oh, beautiful.
[Paul] Yeah.

1112
00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Wow.
[Prue] Look at that.

1113
00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's very neat.

1114
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love that flavour.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, Paul.

1116
00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fantastic flavour.

1117
00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The coffee chocolate that
you put on the top, works so well

1118
00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with the opera cake
and the crème au beurre,

1119
00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as well with the coffee in it.

1120
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's silky smooth, it's delicious.

1121
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You did a great job there, Rahul.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1123
00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Again. Thank you very much.

Thank you.

1125
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't have to go backwards.

1126
00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll do three steps,
and then I'll turn around.

1127
00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can turn around. It's okay.

1128
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1129
00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No excuses. It melted.

1130
00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It looks like it was too thin.

1131
00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Particularly white chocolate,
it has to be quite robust.

1132
00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1133
00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's like a creature.

1134
00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Elegant, it's not.

1135
00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it is lovely, robust, family flavours.

1136
00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Blood orange is just so great.

1137
00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] And the texture of it is beautiful.

1138
00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] The outside is a bit of a mess.

1139
00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. I'll take that.

1140
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispers] I think I might be going home.

1141
00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1157
00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1162
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the caramel works well
with it as well.

1163
00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1167
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1171
00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1172
00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The collar is so lovely and thin,
and the flavour's lovely.

1173
00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've got this smooth
white chocolate that sits in the mousse

1174
00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it is stunning to eat.

1175
00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1176
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that's a triumph.

1177
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1178

1179
00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:10.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1182
00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1183
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1184
00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-[Sandi] There we go.

1187
00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very good.

1188
00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look inside here.

1189
00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've got chocolate brownie,
mascarpone cream

1190
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with raspberry liqueur
and raspberry syllabub.

1191
00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's absolutely delicious.

1192
00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn't say it's elegant.
I think it's hugely decadent.

1193
00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do like the flavours.

1194
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a shame you missed
some of the key ones for me.

1195
00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not getting too much
of the raspberry liqueur.

1196
00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It could have been a bit stronger.

1197
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, never mind. Thank you very much.

1198

1199
00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The whole universe concept,
you've got it. I think it's fantastic.

1200
00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got a lovely shine as well.

1201
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's wonderful.

1202
00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the moment, Kim-Joy.

1203
00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1204
00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1205

[Sandi] There we go.
[Prue] Oh, look at that.

1206
00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Oh, the umbrellas inside.

1207
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] Yay!

1208
00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Those turtles are just perfect.

1209
00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think it looks amazing.

1210
00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's the flavour inside these?

1211
00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Orange and orange liqueur.

1212
00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is very delicious.

1213
00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] And what's lovely is,

1214
00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you thought about how the sauce
was gonna blend with the chocolate,

1215
00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which goes with the choux as well,
and the whole thing works together.

1216
00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got the slight alcoholic kick
at the back of it as well,

1217
00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I think the design is flawless.

1218
00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1221
00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I've ever received.

I would have been confident.

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

it's better to expect the worst

I mean, the outside
didn't look great for Dan.

1248
00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] But the interior was delicious
with those peaches.

1249
00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue]I know.
-Dan's had a good week.

1250
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gotta say Rahul as well.

1251
00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, again.

1252
00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rahul's there again.

1253
00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The truth is,
it's Dan, Rahul and Jon.

1254
00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I want Jon to win on costume alone.

1255
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The person who went into the showstopper
with tears and tension was Karen.

1256
00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She did a very good showstopper.

1257
00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But frankly, I don't think
she's necessarily saved herself.

1258
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Briony's looked the saddest.

1259
00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Basically what she spent three hours
doing was making a tart.

1260
00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we have to say,
this week is very unusual.

1261
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Terry is not here.

1262
00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If Terry were here...

1263
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He might have been the one to go home.

1264
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...he might have been the one to go home.

1265
00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, Prue and I need to
discuss this a little further.

1266
00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know what's the best thing
about all of this?

1267
00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Noel and I have got no decision
to make whatsoever.

1268
00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We'll just go and play Frisbee, right?
-Shall we?

1269
00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1270
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1271
00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If my hands get clammy, I'm sorry.

1272
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't worry. Go for it.

1273
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well done, bakers, another lovely week
with you in the tent.

1274
00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, I get the joy of announcing
who is the star baker,

1275
00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and if I tell you
that this week's star baker

1276
00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
did a peach of a showstopper,

1277
00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think you'll be surprised
to learn that the star baker is...

1278
00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dan!

1280
00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Planet Delicious.

1281
00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, that means I've got the horrible job
of sending someone home.

1282
00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The person who's going home this week...

1283
00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is...

1284
00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...nobody.

1285
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[gasps]
-You...

1286
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1287
00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, man.

[Noel] The judges felt it wouldn't be fair

1290
00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to send someone home
with Terry not being here, so...

1291
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the downside to that,
means that next week

1292
00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
there is a strong possibility that
two people might be going home.

1293
00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] Okay.

1294
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1295
00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And on that note,

1296
00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it feels weird sending no-one home,
so I'm gonna go.

1297
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-It's been great, yeah. Loving your work.
-Such a big fan. Bye, Noel.

1300
00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1301
00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I'll be better. I promise.

Do you know what, the great thing,
is that at the end of each show

1308
00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you get a clean slate.

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Oh, my God.

1310
00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I'm through to another week.
