<c.bg_transparent>So I have made for you</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>a stout cake with a stout caramel</c.bg_transparent>

1197
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>and a milk chocolate whipped ganache.</c.bg_transparent>

1198
00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1199

1200
00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>It's the flavour I'm not really keen on.</c.bg_transparent>

1201
00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-Not much else there.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-There's a bitterness to it.</c.bg_transparent>

1202
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Let's have a look at these feet.</c.bg_transparent>

1203
00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Shortbread biscuit with marshmallow</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>and a cherry and kirsch jam.</c.bg_transparent>

1204
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>I quite like that. I think it probably</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>needed more bake on the biscuit.</c.bg_transparent>

1205
00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-It's a bit soft.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-Yeah.</c.bg_transparent>

1206
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-This is the egg.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-It's a chai whipped ganache,</c.bg_transparent>

1207
00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>some biscuit, and then</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>there's an Italian meringue in there.</c.bg_transparent>

1208
00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>It's quite strong, that.</c.bg_transparent>

1209
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>I think I'd like that</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>That was brutal.</c.bg_transparent>

1215
00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>A bake like that,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>I don't think is redeemable.</c.bg_transparent>

1216
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Definitely one of the bottom ones</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>in the Showstopper.</c.bg_transparent>

1217
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Obviously, I don't want to go home,</c.bg_transparent>

1219

<c.bg_transparent>I mean, I was so surprised</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>with regards to Aaron.</c.bg_transparent>

1220
00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>He literally had smashed the Technical,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>smashed the Signature,</c.bg_transparent>

1221
00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>and this looked smashed.</c.bg_transparent>

1222
00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Unfortunately,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>he was in line for Star Baker,</c.bg_transparent>

1223
00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>but he's certainly dropped down the order.</c.bg_transparent>

1224
00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>On the other hand,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>I think Jasmine did well.</c.bg_transparent>

1225
00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Thought the cake was good.</c.bg_transparent>

1226
00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Her finesse is on a different level</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>though, isn't it?</c.bg_transparent>

1227
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>I mean, look at that piping. Beautiful.</c.bg_transparent>

1228
00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>I did like Tom's.</c.bg_transparent>

1229
00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-I think Toby's joined him.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-Toby did well.</c.bg_transparent>

1230
00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-Toby's balls were amazing.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-His balls were--</c.bg_transparent>

1231
00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>So I think he's put himself in line</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>for Star Baker.</c.bg_transparent>

1232
00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Obviously, someone</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>is not gonna graduate today.</c.bg_transparent>

1233
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>The one I'm most sort of disappointed in</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>is Iain.</c.bg_transparent>

1234
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>He can bake better than that.</c.bg_transparent>

1235
00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>It was three different disciplines,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>and, for me, he failed on all three.</c.bg_transparent>

1236
00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>-What about Jessika?</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-But not just the bake.</c.bg_transparent>

1237
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>It was about</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>the flavour combinations were wrong.</c.bg_transparent>

1238
00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>She was in a bit of danger anyway</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>coming into today.</c.bg_transparent>

1239
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>I think, on the other hand,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>Nadia and Nataliia,</c.bg_transparent>

1240
00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>who were in serious trouble,</c.bg_transparent>

1241
00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>have both lifted themselves up.</c.bg_transparent>

1242
00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>So, unfortunately,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>I think it's between Jessika and Iain.</c.bg_transparent>
