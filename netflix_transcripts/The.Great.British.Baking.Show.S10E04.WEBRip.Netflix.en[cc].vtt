my mind goes only to fajitas.

Mexican food's fun, but Mexican baking?
What do the Mexicans bake?

27
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

using one of the yeasted varieties

35
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

39
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pan dulce. It means sweet bread.

40
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not cake, it's not a bread.

41
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

42
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

how they're supposed to be like.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Now what is a pan dulce?

44
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Basically, it's an enriched bread,
an enriched roll.

45
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are dozens and dozens

46
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they change from region to region.

47
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Because it's an enriched dough,
it's gonna be slower proving.

48
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've got to get that dough rising
as quickly as possible.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and that's what we expect
this week from the bakers.

56
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

decorate them as little cactuses.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Cacti, yes. That is correct.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

322
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like the craquelin on the top
and the way it's been cut.

340
00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The roll is pretty equal colour as well.
Let's see what it's like.

341
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you need more lime,
and the bun is quite dry.

343

344
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd like to have seen it more open
and that's because you used plain flour.

345
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the problem is for me,
it's not punching any flavours at all.

346
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the look of them, though.

347
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I think

348
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Paul] Let's look inside.

350
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the look of this. Lots of filling.

351
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Love the flavour. It's under-proved.

352
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hugely under-proved.
It's so dense, it's almost dough-like.

353
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Do you know,
I think the flavour is fantastic.

354
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is a bit tight and stiff.

355
00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The overall look, awful.
Craquelin's not good.

356
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Looks like you sat on 'em.
-Oh, all right, it's killing me. Okay.

357
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It's split, hasn't it?
-[Paul] Yeah.

358
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The roll is okay.
Needed a bit more of a dome on it.

359
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The colour looks nice.

360
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The lemon in there's good.
The craquelin was too heavy.

361
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Too thick, and then it's weighted it down
so the bread couldn't bloom.

362
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's created quite a stretchy dough.

363
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's nicely-made bread.

364
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just the craquelin's the problem.
-Yeah.

365
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're certainly showing off
your sugar craft skills.

366
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I love the top.
That top is, it's fantastic.

367
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Craquelin's definitely too thick.
-[Paul] Really dry because of it.

368
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very dense.

369
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not a huge amount of flavour either.
Bit of kick in the craquelin.

370
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's going to be as plain as that,
it needs a filling.

371
00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're not totally even in shape.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They're not really

373
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It wouldn't matter
what shape they were

374
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as long as they were all the same.

375
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely flavour.

376
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the orange
and the anise comes through.

377
00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just, it's under-proved.
It's quite dense, but the taste is great.

378
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bread dough is a little heavy,
but the whole thing is delicious.

379
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.

380
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look quite impressive, quite nice.

381
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're glue.
-[Prue] They are cake-like.

382
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Abdul] Mmm-hmm.
-Do you want a taste?

383
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Abdul] Sure.
-[Paul] The flavours are quite delicate,

384
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the raspberry and the coconut.
It sort of works.

385
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's too dense.
That, for me, is not right.

386
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's not quite right.
-Okay.

387
00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I think they look absolutely beautiful.
They definitely look like corn.

388
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're clever. They do look pretty good.

389
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's inside it?

390
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] It's corn custard filling.

391
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That looks really good.

392
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the flavour.
It's quite dry, but it's very interesting.

393
00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You added filling
before it went in the oven.

394
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-[Paul] So it couldn't grow.

395
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then you had a craquelin on the top,
which prevents growth. So it stays solid.

396
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you end up with going back to dough.
Like the idea, though.

397
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I've made conchas,

398
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the flavours I've used
are cinnamon and orange.

399
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Yeah, I like the size. Could've done with
a bit more of a dome. You've got some.

401
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got a bit of height there.
Craquelin's sitting quite nicely on it.

402
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The craquelin's really good.

403
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a little bit crisper,
so you get that contrast.

404
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's good bread.

405
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Your flavour's nice.
I like the look of them.

406
00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got a real instinct
for what goes with what.

407
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I think
those are all beautiful flavours.

408
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're overbaked.

409
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You can see by the colour underneath.
-[Dawn] Yeah.

410
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Size-wise, they're okay.
I'd like to have seen more of a dome.

411
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've lost that because of the filling.
The design's messy.

412
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all over the place
because it's cracked coming through

413
00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you've lost the definition.

414
00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. I didn't want it
to be a case of hunt the ganache.

415
00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But are we going to get
the promised chilli? That's the thing.

416
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dawn] Not immediately.

417
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You do get the chilli.
You're right, it comes later.

418
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chilli content in the chocolate
is perfect. Just the right amount.

419
00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's messy for me.
-Yes.

420
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All over the place.
It's not tidy or accurate enough.

421
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I agree.
I think it tastes good, textures are good.

422
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Doesn't look too good.
-No.

423
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look great. I like the look of them.

424
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] They do look
like little drunk fellas.

425
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Could do with being
a bit more open.

426
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Another five-ten minutes proving.
-Okay.

427
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I really do like the flavour.
The dough is nearly there.

428
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To be honest,
this is one of the best we've tasted.

429
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all good.

430
00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ten more minutes proving,
you'd have had perfection.

431
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

432
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it went pretty well.
Almost got a handshake. Stingy git.

433
00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was so happy about the chilli.

434
00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I was watching their faces,

435
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
all of a sudden they were like,
"Yes, the chilli is now creeping up."

436
00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know, if I'm not
bottom two or three, I'd be happy.

437
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't wanna say disastrous,
but borderline. [laughs]

438
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[buzzing]

439
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>While the bakers</i>

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, it's time
for your technical challenge,

443
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

"Paul Hollywood."

444
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ring any bells?

445
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never heard of him.

446
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, er, Paul, any words of advice?

447
00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got to get
your flavour combinations right

448
00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

449
00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As ever, the technical challenge
will be judged blind,

450
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so we're gonna have to ask these two
to vacate the tent. Off you go.

451
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're going to a soft play area.
-What, to go in the pit of balls?

452
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, Paul in the balls.
-Yeah.

453
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For your technical challenge,

454
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Paul" would like you
to make eight Mexican tacos.

455
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your tacos
should be made from yellow field corn

456
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then hand pressed.

457
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On top of each should be steak,

458
00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
spicy refried beans,

459
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
guacamole and pico de gallo.

460
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] You have two hours.
-On your marks…

461
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get set…
-Bake!

462
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, this is gonna be interesting.

463
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tacos, new one on me.

464
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never made 'em
from scratch before. Oh, no.

465
00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is my first time doing tacos.

466
00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I bet it's the same like
you make tortillas.

467
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I never made tortillas either.

468
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, tacos for a technical.

469
00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's Mexican Week, Prue.
It has to be tacos.

470
00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Tell me about the fillings then.

471
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've got a pico de gallo
which is basically a salsa,

472
00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a guacamole, then the steak,
and a little bit of cheese,

473
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and also refried beans.

474
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must say, it does look good.

475
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the big thing
is getting the taco right.

476
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thickness of the tortilla,
is it gonna be too thick or too thin,

477
00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then the actual stage on the pan.

478
00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You only need
less than a minute on both sides.

479
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you do any more, it will dry out

480
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and when you try
and roll it up into a taco, it will crack.

481
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's got to be pliable.
-And they are very thin.

482
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are very thin,
and if it is thin, it will work.

483
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One of the big things in Mexico
when you're having a taco,

484
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's lovely to have a lot of filling,
but it has to be practical too.

485
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you should be able to encase it
and then eat it.

486
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Yeah.
-If it's too much, it'll go everywhere.

487
00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, Prue.

488
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Choose your taco.
-[Prue] Okay. Okay.

489
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hmm.
-[Paul] Wow.

490
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Corn flavour
coming from the taco is perfect.

491
00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Blended with all the ingredients.
Overall, it's a delicious eat.

492
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me,
this is Mexican cooking on a plate.

493
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can I have it for my lunch?
-[chuckles]

494
00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The instructions
aren't really that detailed.

495
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For each element, it just says,
"Make the pico de gallo,

496
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
make the refried beans,
make the guacamole."

497
00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite scant.

498
00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you made, er, tacos--
-No. No.

499
00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hang on. You don't know
what the question was gonna be.

500
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So the first bit is, "For the tortillas,

501
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
blend the drained corn
until you have a smooth, thick paste."

502
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Tip the processed corn

then mix to form a dough."

504
00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Masa harina, I think it's like corn flour.

505
00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kevin] I'm not sure
how this dough's meant to look.

506
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's corn, I don't suppose
it needs a lot of kneading.

507
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Think it'll be sort of like
a thick bread-like dough texture.

508
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They want to be rested.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the ingredients
tell you what spices and herbs to use,

516
00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but they don't say how much.

517
00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, my God, they don't give you
any teaspoonfuls or anything.

518
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ground cumin.

519
00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Smoked paprika, dried oregano.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

523
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So we will be going easy.

524
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just hope my, er, chilli is not too hot.

525
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

526
00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

527
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can't really taste this.

528
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Blech! It's burning my mouth.
Well, it's meant to be hot anyway.

529
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Beef marinated.

531
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Excuse me.

532
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's pico de gallo?

533
00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Pico de gallio."

534
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Interesting, pico de gallo.
First time I've heard them.

535
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think pico means small, maybe.

536
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like a salsa,
just reading the ingredients.

537
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
White onion, very big white onion.

[Carole] Deseed a tomato?
How do you deseed a tomato?

540
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chilli went in, coriander, juice, salt.

541
00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could eat a tub of coriander by itself.
It's gorgeous.

542
00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love coriander and cilantro.
I know people hate it.

543
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Apparently, there's a gene
that makes you taste coriander like soap.

544
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It taste like soap.
-[Rebs] Everybody's got their own tastes.

545
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm doing this to my taste,
but it might not be to Paul's.

546
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Spicy, soapy, salty and sour. Great.

547
00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Noel, do you wanna hear my Mexican accent?

548
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

You are halfway through.
What do you reckon?

551
00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's really good.
-Thank you.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So to make the refried beans,

554
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the instructions said,
"Make the refried beans."

555
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I make kidney beans
at home with coconut milk.

556
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So same method without coconut.

557
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I think we just fry them
with everything that's here.

558
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna fry onion with garlic.

559
00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna add chilli powder,
salt, black beans.

560
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go half. Don't go mad, Carole.

561
00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is really hot.
I don't think it's supposed to be hot.

562
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then this one
straight up won't turn on.

563
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-I'm trying to make it turn on.

565
00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Everything's happening at once.
-You're having a breakdown.

568
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's not even happening.
That's inside your head.

569
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] It's not that cooked,

570
00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'm just gonna simmer
and it'll get soft.

571
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] We'll let that thicken a bit.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

never made this, never.

[Carole] Now how many avocados
do we put in there? Oh, God.

575
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Chopped tomatoes are going in.
Red onion. Jalapeños.

576
00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Juice of lime.

577
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause Paul said
it's about flavour and texture.

578
00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I, like, blitz the avocado
till it's smooth and creamy.

579
00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're looking for smooth and chunky.
That's the best way.

580
00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is perfect for me.
-[Syabira] So my beans finish.

581
00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that's what
refried beans looks like.

582
00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

584
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are small, but I guess
tacos are supposed to be small.

607
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ta-da! "Bite size,"
I think, is the correct term.

608
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What next? "Cook the tortillas." [laughs]

609
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tortillas, traditionally, I think
are meant to be cooked on a hot stone.

610

Boop.

612
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm thinking two minutes on each side.

613
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] One minute each side,
should be done.

614
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Put it in a very high heat so it puff.

615
00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Puff, puff.

616
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, we have some puffing.

617
00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes!
-[Carole] They're puffing now.

618
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is it meant to happen?
I don't wanna overcook 'em.

619
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why don't you just put that under there
and I'll go… As if I leant on it and…

620
00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like in the Chuckle Brothers?
[chuckles] Shall we try?

621
00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-I need…

622
00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You need them, don't you?
-I need these, yeah.

623
00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] Two done.

624
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know
how they're meant to look exactly,

625
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I want some brown on there.

626
00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't want your tortilla
to be too dry. Not bad.

627
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've started cracking.
That's a problem.

628
00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, no, this one's burnt.
This one's burnt. Ah.

629
00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it's not puffing up.

630
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carole] Do they look like a tortilla?
[laughing] Haven't got a clue.

631
00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're very small, aren't they?
-[Janusz] Last one. They look cooked.

632
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's so many things to go wrong. Ugh!

633
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Okay, Matt.
-[Matt] Yeah.

634
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Okay.

635
00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why don't you do a time call?
-Okay.

636
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And I won't interrupt you or anything.
-Okay.

637
00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You just do it.
-You sure?

638
00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Okay.

639
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

640
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weren't you supposed to interrupt me?

641
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

642
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's all my tacos done.
Just need to make steak now.

643
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] The plan is to fry the steak.

644
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Medium rare.

645
00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Straight in.
[in American accent] Nice and sizzly.

646
00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That looks like expensive meat actually.

647
00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which is weird
'cause we found that in a skip.

648
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

649
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[hums] I don't know how to cook steak.

650
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would cook it
about five minutes each side.

651
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Couple of minutes on each side.
If I've got time.

652
00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone's got an opinion on steak
and everyone thinks you've done it wrong.

653
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Maxy] I could go longer,
but I'm scared to overcook it.

654
00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll give it another 30 seconds.

655
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Syabira] Nice pink in the middle.
-[Dawn] That's still mooing.

656
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] It's all right.

657
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rebs] Oh, Maxy,
your steak's cooked perfectly.

658
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My steak's gonna be hot.
I wouldn't eat it.

-[Syabira] And then the fried beans.

664
00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just don't know how much of each to use.
I won't put that much in.

665

and slightly too much chilli, but…

708
00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hmm.
-Everything else is wonderful.

709
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Okay, moving on.

710
00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Now these…
-[Prue] A little too full, isn't it?

711
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. For the size of them.

712
00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Little bit thick as well actually.
They're very small.

713
00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm… I'm getting slightly
over-seasoned, a bit salty.

714
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll tell you where there's too much salt.
In the taco.

715
00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They're a little bit dry.
You wouldn't expect them to be that dry.

716
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Moving on.
The feathering round the outside,

717
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
they should be beautifully round.
They're all over the place.

718
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is quite a dry one as well.
That cow's still mooing.

719
00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] I like the flavour.
-Yeah.

720
00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Right.
-[Paul] These look quite pale.

721
00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Almost underdone.
-It's also got too much filling, I think.

722
00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think there is.

723
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Again, quite salty, isn't it?
-[Prue] It's very well-seasoned.

724
00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Even too much.
-[Paul] Too much.

725
00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Now, these are too small.

726
00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's ridiculously thick.

727
00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There isn't as much seasoning in that one,
but the meat's cooked well. Moving on.

728
00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-[Prue] They look quite thin.
-[Paul] They've been cooked quite nicely.

729
00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-And I quite like that--
-But that fits nicely.

730
00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, and there's not too much in it. So…
-Yeah.

731
00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:11.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Taco's good. Meat, tick. Guac, tick.
And the pico's nice as well.

732
00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It works as a taco.
-[Prue] Hmm.

733
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Oh, dear. Far too thick.

734
00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Far, far too thick.

735
00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Too much chilli.
-[Paul] Too thick.

736
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The meat needs to be cut smaller
on something so dainty and small.

737
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] Okay, this is the right size.

738
00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-[Paul] These here are cracked, see?
-[Prue] Yeah.

739
00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] They've overdone 'em.

740
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm-hmm.

741
00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The guacamole's very nice.
The beef's nice and rare.

742
00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The flavour's okay,
but the taco's overcooked.

743
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] Last one.

744
00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] These are quite delicate tortillas.

745
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] Yeah, they're thin.

746
00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's a good one.
Guacamole's excellent. I really like that.

747
00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The tacos are nice.
Not getting much chilli.

748
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] No.
-Okay.

749
00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

753
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

massively over-seasoned

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

764
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

783
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the judges would like you
to create your own take

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

obviously refers to the three milks

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that are traditionally used
to soak the sponge once its baked.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but your cake must consist

789
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

794
00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love a tres leches. My favourite thing
is that it's full of moisture.

795
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A tres leches cake
basically means three-milk cake.

796
00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Evaporated milk,
condensed milk, and double cream.

797
00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I never tried tres leches cake before.

798
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Put all these milks together,
make a syrup of it,

799
00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
make lots of holes in the cake
and pour the syrup all over.

800
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that soaks in
and allows the cake to really moisten up.

801
00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] What it mustn't do
is to so sog up the cake

802
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that the milks
are running out of the bottom.

803
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's gonna have to be layers
of moist cake one on top of another.

804
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is tricky.

805
00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The difficulty
we're all gonna face is the soak.

806
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Because the cakes are so moist,

807
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when they lift the cake,
it could fall apart.

808
00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's too soaked structurally,

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

1116
00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God.

1117
00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] I just want something out there.

1118
00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

1119
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] Right, let's do the 'tache.

1120
00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[James] Oh, cover the holes
with fun piping

1121
00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and make it look like a natural look.

1122
00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up.

1123
00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please step away
from your tres leches cakes.

1124
00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm stepping away.

1125
00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

1126
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs] It's four hours bake.
You won't make it perfect, will you?

1127
00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1128
00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's so messy. I'm literally about to cry.

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1131
00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your decoration is so accurate
and beautiful and piping is so good.

1132
00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Let's have a look.

1133
00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the soak's a bit dry
on a couple of them.

1134
00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Top two seems wetter than the bottom.
-I agree.

1135
00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

1136
00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

1137
00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's such a surprise.
It tastes likes sweetcorn.

1138
00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1139
00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It does, yeah.

1140
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, we asked you to be imaginative.
Well, that is imaginative.

1141
00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not for me.

1142
00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My only quarrel
is I think it would've been better

1143
00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
not to have the lumps of corn in the cake
'cause it spoils the texture.

1144
00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it was a really good original cake.
Well done, Syabira.

1145
00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you.

1146
00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think, overall, you attempted too much.

1147
00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-None of it's neat enough.
-Hmm.

1148
00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The fraisier cake needs to be much neater.

1149
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The collar has lost all its shine.
The pipe work isn't particularly good.

1150
00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I have a few issues with this.
-[Prue] It is a bit untidy.

1151
00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But let's see what it tastes like.

1152
00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Well, it does look good.

1153
00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hmm. The cake layer
is absolutely delicious.

1154
00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the flavour of the fraisier tart.
Creaminess, the lightness, the vanilla.

1155
00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The top sponge is a bit tough.
Much drier than the bottom one.

1156
00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bottom layer is the chilli one?

1157
00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got a lime curd
and a crème pat in it.

1158
00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The sponge is good,
but it is unevenly soaked.

1159
00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the lime curd and the sponge,
but it is messy.

1160
00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1161
00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Well, I must say I love the idea.

1162
00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Icing is a little rough and ready.

1163
00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Some of the milky syrup is running out,
which must mean it's quite well-soaked.

1164
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe over-soaked.

1165
00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think the design is fantastic

1166
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and to make it
in tres leches cake is tricky.

1167
00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've pulled it off all right.

1168
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's that in the bottom,
is it where the milks haven't soaked in?

1169
00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kevin] There's probably
a few parts where it's not soaked in.

1170
00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I love the flavour.

1171
00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got a little bit of a kick.
Quite a kick. It's strong chilli.

1172
00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite pungent,

1173
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the biggest issue
I have is the texture.

1174
00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've got flour lumps in there.
-[Prue] Yeah.

1175
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A real pity because flavour's good.

1176
00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We asked for vibrant colour

1177
00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and we've got it,
and I love the look of it.

1178
00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the cake is quite effective.
Your colours are strong.

1179
00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the decoration on top,
but let's see what it looks like inside.

1180
00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Ooh.
-[Noel] Wow.

1181
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bit of cake I've just got
doesn't seem to have been soaked at all.

1182
00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you got chilli in there?
-Yeah, in the ganache.

1183
00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is it too strong?
-Yes. [laughs]

1184
00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue and Carole laugh]

1185
00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I put it in my mouth,
I was like, "What is that?"

1186
00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've added a punch
and a punch and a punch and a punch

1187
00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:30.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and then destroyed what it actually was.
-Hmm.

1188
00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think your criticism is too strong.
I think it's a really well-made cake.

1189
00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A good job with the look.
I thought your flavours were too much.

1190
00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1191
00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it looks lovely.

1192
00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite cartoon-like, but highly effective.

1193
00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The drips are perfect.
-[Prue] I think it's beautifully executed.

1194
00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's as neat as a pin
and it's very modern-looking.

1195
00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at that. [chuckles]
How about that for colour?

1196
00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:03.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cake is quite dense.

1197
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sponge is a little too dry.
You could've got more soak in there.

1198
00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But your saving grace
is the guava and the passion fruit.

1199
00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would agree.
It looks absolutely wonderful.

1200
00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavour's fantastic. I just think
that the cake is a little too firm.

1201
00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] I think the skulls work.
Day of the Dead, celebration.

1202
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a little bit wonky.

1203
00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I agree it's on the lean.

1204
00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think it's an attractive,
unusual-looking cake.

1205
00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very even layers.

1206
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The soak's gone through.
Quite nicely on each.

1207
00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The passion fruit and the lime…
-[Prue] Mmm, is lovely.

1208
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
…work really nicely together.
You've done a decent job.

1209
00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sandro, I absolutely love the look of it.

1210
00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is a bit wonky.

1211
00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is wonky on the top,
which winds me up a bit,

1212
00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I love the colours.
It looks very good.

1213
01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

1214
01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] The bottom tier
is a chocolate coffee cake.

1215
01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The top is a spiced chocolate cake
with spiced chocolate ganache

1216
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and cherry compote.

1217
01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It looks like
a black forest gateau actually.

1218
01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm.

1219
01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know we always ask for strong flavours,
but I think you've overdone it a bit.

1220
01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's too much booze,
too much chilli, too much cherry.

1221
01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A bit milder,
the bottom one, so it works nicer.

1222
01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandro] Thank you.
-[Prue] That bottom layer is delicious.

1223
01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's something
of a little triumph.

1224
01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I have done a tres leches wedding cake,
a rustic wedding cake.

1225
01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is rustic. You're right.
-[Rebs] Yeah.

1226
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Bit of leakage down there as well.

1227
01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That is very boozy.

1228
01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul coughs]

1229
01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you got chilli in that ganache?
-Yeah.

1230
01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckling] Wow.

1231
01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's supposed to be mellowed by the cream.

1232
01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[coughing] Filling is too much.

1233
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Little less tequila
and quite a lot less chilli.

1234
01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] You get hit with big flavours.
-[Prue] Hmm.

1235
01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you'd held back,
you'd have had an all-round nicer cake.

1236
01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The overall look is good.

1237
01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your piping work,
the way it all cascades down looks great.

1238
01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yes, I like it. I love the colours.

1239
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Cuts nice.

1240
01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that's interesting.

1241
01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The buttercream's got a nice lightness
to go with the richness of the cake.

1242
01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chocolate flavour
comes through nicely.

1243
01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So between the two,
it's quite stark but it works.

1244
01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] You've done a good job, Maxy.

1245
01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks simple and effective.
Quite elegant.

1246
01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's see what it looks like inside.

1247
01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, that's soft.

1248
01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's heaven.

1249
01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That flavour is heaven.

1250
01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the crunch, I like the soft cake.

1251
01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's good.

1252
01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The sponge is so soft.
-[Prue] Hmm.

1253
01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] The coffee levels are perfect.
-[Prue] Wow.

1254
01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's really good.

1255
01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dawn] Thank you very much.

1256
01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[applause]

1257
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't believe that.

1258
01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Absolutely stunned.
-Everything they said was fair.

1259
01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Clumps of flour in your cake batter
just isn't acceptable.

1260
01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] She said it's a triumph.

1261
01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Triumph." That's a… That's a good word.

1262
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carole] If you went to put a bet on me,
I think I'd give myself seven to one.

1263
01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My chances ain't very good.

1264
01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[James] I think
I'm definitely in the firing line.

1265
01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They asked for Mexican
and I feel it was more of a Mexi-can't.

1266
01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

1267
01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We didn't get the Mexican weather.
It's been pretty cold again.

1268
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we had some good Mexican showstoppers.

1269
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] They looked beautiful.

1270
01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] They looked Mexican.
Lots of bright colours.

1271
01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's two people
that pull themselves up quite a bit

1272
01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I think Abdul and Dawn…

1273
01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dawn smashed it.

1274
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Both of them catapulted themselves up.

1275
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] What she was so clever about
is she wasn't over-complicating anything.

1276
01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then you look at the other side
of the coin, James, what was that about?

1277
01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He stretched himself too much.
That fraisier cake was not good.

1278
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And the collar was dull, it was matte.
-And it was very clumsy.

1279
01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Too many elements.

1280
01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I'd say exactly the same about Carole.

1281
01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] Coming into today,
Carole was near the bottom.

1282
01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me, she still is.
The other person in trouble was Rebs

1283
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I think she still is.

1284
01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Those cakes were far too strong.

1285
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[gasps] Everything was too strong.
-We could get rid of two today.

1286
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is legitimate reason.

1287
01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To be honest,
we had three pretty poor performances

1288
01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
from Carole, Rebs, and James.

1289
01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Has Dawn done enough with the showstopper
to be a consideration for Star Baker?

1290
01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Without a shadow of a doubt,
Dawn's pushed herself up.

1291
01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not quite in line with Star Baker.
-Right.

1292
01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Maxy is, I think Sandro is.

1293
01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-And Janusz.

1294
01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have to put Janusz in as well.

1295
01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hello, bakers. Well done again
on that showstopper, it was amazing.

1296
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Luckily this week,
I've got the fabulous job

1297
01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of announcing
which one of you has won Star Baker.

1298
01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the person
who is Star Baker this week is…

1299
01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maxy.

1300
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Janusz] Yeah!
-[applause]

1301
01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughter]
-Good girl.

1302
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have the less fun job
of saying who's leaving us.

1303
01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And yes, this week it is two bakers.

1304
01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the two bakers
who are leaving us this week are…

1305
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
James… and Rebs.

1306
01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carole sighs]

1307
01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[indistinct chatter]

1308
01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Honestly, devastated.
This means the world to me.

1309
01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, Rebs. It's hard in this tent.

1310
01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's only cake.
-[Rebs sobs]

1311
01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Poor Rebs.

1312
01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Her flavours were just too strong
and too many of them.

1313
01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Bake Off's</i> been a fabulous experience.
I just didn't want it cut this short.

1314
01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gutted for James as well.
James is such a fabulous person.

1315
01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's been fun though,
so I don't mind. [laughs]

1316
01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm always sad to see any bakers go,
but particularly James.

1317
01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To use a fun metaphor,

1318
01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I was a plant
that fruits were outgrowing its pot.

I think Maxy winning Star Baker
