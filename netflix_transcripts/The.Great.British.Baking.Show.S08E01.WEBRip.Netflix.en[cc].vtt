00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a beautiful coffee
and vanilla Battenberg.

506
00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you explained it wrong.

507
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's lacking identity.

508
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-[Paul] He's just unfinished.

509
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Linda] Yes.
-[Paul] Oh, we have the St George flag.

510
00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's over-baked. It's bone dry.
-Yeah.

511
00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I wish we could give you marks

512
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-for your handsome cousin.
-[Linda] He's lovely.

513
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Very striking.
-[Paul] I can smell the bubble gum.

514
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] About to say…
-So can I. [chuckles]

515
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a good thing.

516
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm rolling it round
to try and blow a bubble.

517
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I reckon if I did it long enough,
I probably could. That's bone dry.

518
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavours are intense.
I love bubble gum, I like cream soda,

519
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it just needed to be
a little bit less heavy.

520
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it's really thick, the marzipan.

521
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do rather like it, I have to say.

522
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I have my ninth birthday party,
can you cook for me?

523
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will try not to over bake the sponges.
So, we've got a deal. [laughs]

524
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's a nice light sponge.

525
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a little thick,
but I like the marzipan.

526
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pomegranates don't do anything
flavour-wise.

527
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's pistachio in the green sponge,

528
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-that brings a lovely texture to it.
-Thank you.

529
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] If Fanny Cradock
was gonna do a Battenberg…

530
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[both] That would be it.
-Is that a compliment?

531
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Marc] I know…
-[Prue] I think it's a bit too busy.

532
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Good strong sour cherry. Lovely.
-[Paul] Fantastic.

533
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-There's too much rose water.
-Okay.

534
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Shall I open it for you?
-[Paul] Please.

535
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I like it wrapped up.
Oh, I love your stripes.

536
00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] The starburst.
-Yeah.

537
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a little bit messy.
Was it warm when you were doing it?

538
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

539
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The colours are really wonderful.

540
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the cake.

541
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They both taste the same,
is that meant to…

542
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Er, yes?
-[Prue and Lottie laughing]

543
00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The yellow is supposed be a custard.

544
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] They both taste delicious,
and the same.

545
00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The rhubarb jam
that you've made is nice and strong.

546
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And there's enough acidity in it
to cut the sweetness.

547
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a good effort.

548
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm struggling not to eat more.
-[Matt] Mmm.

549
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do you want to finish?
-I'll stay here

550
00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and eat.
-Please do.

551
00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They'll judge everyone else.

552
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had to change the design
at the very last minute.

553
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So no temple, then?
-It's a deconstructed temple.

554
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think the night sky
looks quite effective.

555
00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yes. And actually, it's quite neat.

556
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can tell by the way
the knife goes through

557
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that that's quite a heavy sponge.

558
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a bit hard work for cake.
-[Rowan] Okay.

559
00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

560
00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's moisture in there
that still needs to get out.

561
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

562
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That looks really pretty.
-Thank you.

563
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I like the decoration.
I like that you've glazed it, too,

564
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause that, again, sets it off.

565
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The flavours are there.

566
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The texture is very good. It's very neat.

567
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the marzipan.
Individual elements are good,

568
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-including the buttercream.
-It's a lovely piece of cake.

569
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you so much.

570
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's the stalk made from?

571
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sura] You're not meant to eat it.
-I know that now.

572
00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

573
00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a clove.
So your mouth's gonna be numb now.

574
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It tastes of Christmas.

575
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, yeah.
-Sorry.

576
00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fine 'cause the cake was delicious.

577
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't mind.
-Thank you so much.

578
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Half of the Battenberg is on the…
the bottom of the oven.

580
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not great.
Erm, it's like toast. It's horrible.

581
00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it turned out okay.

582
00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yay!

583
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That couldn't have gone much better.
I'm really pretty amped about that, yeah.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Breathe.

586
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was aiming for the middle
of the road and got it.

587
00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't want to make a name
for myself first… first bake.

588
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It wasn't a resounding success.
But I thought it was useful.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

My dad and my husband love it.
So, I've made it a few times.

[Peter] I've made
pineapple upside-down cake in school.

[Matt] <i>In each technical challenge,</i>
<i>the bakers are given identical ingredients</i>

612
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>and the same pared-down recipe.</i>

613
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've actually never made this before.
Funny enough.

614
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never even tried one.

615
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've heard of it.
I've not eaten one, I don't think.

616
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is a classic bake.
Pineapple upside-down cake is something

617
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I used to have at school dinners.

618
00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It does look lovely.
Shall we taste it?

619
00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's light, buttery, but also,
you have the perfect caramel.

620
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it goes too dark, it's too bitter.
But if you can't see the caramel,

621
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you're not gonna be able
to get that caramel flavour.

622
00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The worst thing is ripping the sponge
when they're trying to get it out.

623
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Getting it out of the tin
is where most people come unstuck

624
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the caramel
sticks to the edge and it's difficult.

625
00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Gonna be interesting.

626
00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't want to eat this
'cause I've got 12 to come.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Sura] The first step is for the syrup.

629

631

633
00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The caramel can crystallise very quickly.

634
00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm trying not to stir it,
but I need it to hurry up

635
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

636
00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've not made many caramels, so…

637
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Slightly nervous.

638
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, how's it going?

639
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Loriea] It's a case of multi-tasking
and keeping my eyes on the syrup.

640
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] You pull this off, maybe…
-I might just make it to next week.

641
00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
…the dry blue cake
might become a distant memory.

642
00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I think that'll be
haunting me for a while.

643
00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Linda] "Remove from heat

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
stand back
as the caramel will spit a bit."

645
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then, I'll reduce it and simmer
until it is in syrup consistency.

646
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You need to hurry up.

647
00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Loriea] I'm fairly happy.

648
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's looking a bit blond
so I need to take the syrup

649
00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that little bit further.

650
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's getting close.
I'll turn it down a bit.

651
00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks like it could burn on me.

652
00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Might be a bit too dark, not sure.

653
00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It did smell
like it was about to burn. But, erm…

654
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Happy with it.

655
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now I'm on to the very instructional stage
of making the sponge.

656
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So that's butter and sugar.
You beat it until it's light.

657
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Next…

658
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Add a little bit of flour as you go,

659
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because it can just curdle a little bit.

660
00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna try and not have a dry sponge.

661
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

662
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to make sure they'll get out.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

So they've not worked.

Oh, gosh. They're like toffee. There's
too much syrup. That's what it was.

713
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lottie] Shall I do that thing
that people do on <i>Bake Off?</i>

714
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just do this for a little while.

715
00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does this work? You think this works?

716
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everybody wafts.

717
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bit of waftage.

718
00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

719
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

722
00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, dear.

723
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I should turn them out.

724
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Laura] Moment of truth.

725
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's one that's good,
but the pineapple didn't come out,

726
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-so we're on a rescue mission.
-Er, ooh, er. [laughs]

727
00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

728
00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughing] They're not gonna come out,
I don't think.

729
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Put it that way.

730
00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Marc] It would've been nice
to have nice, clean sides,

731
00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I didn't grease my moulds.

732
00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They would've been even
if I managed to carve it out nicer.

733
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Linda] I could just shape that like that.
Oh, they are a disaster, aren't they?

734
00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Laura] Gonna pipe the rosettes on,

736
00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Put some cream, a cherry on top.

737
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think they'll be cool enough.

738
00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Mark] It's too hot.
-[Loriea] Ooh, that one was not ready.

739
00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cream's starting to fall off.

740
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up.

741
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-[Loriea] What a hideous cake.

745
00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Oh, I think I deserve a cherry.

746
00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Look at this.
-[Mark] Oh, no.

747
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sura] Oh! Go away. Ugh!

748
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ooh. [gasps]
-[Rowan] No!

749
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so sorry.

750
00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God.

751
00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm so sorry. There was a fly.
I went to shoo it away,

752
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and knocked… Look.
-Don't worry about it. It's fine.

753
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm… I'm sure they can go by

754
00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
what they looked like
before I brought them over.

755
00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sura] Let's tidy it up.
-[Matt] The good news

756
00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is the front two are absolutely fine.
And we'll tell Paul what happened.

757
00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispers] Oh, don't cry. It's all right.

758
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's okay.
-[Sura] Such a horrible thing…

759
00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I know.
You know what? He's okay.

760
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Mark] Total accident.

761
00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It happens. Accidents happen.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I blame Matt, really.
-[Matt] It was actually my fault,

763
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I was looking at you
at the time it happened.

764
00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you were probably
hypnotised by my beauty.

765
00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

766
00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] That's what happened.
-Maybe.

767
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue are expecting</i>

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

772
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's got a nice height to it.
-[Prue] It's about the right colour.

773
00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cream went on
when they were still hot.

774
00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Let's have a look.

775
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nice and light, it's well-balanced.
-Very light.

776
00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Again, it's the heat.

777
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can see where the cream melted
and it slid off the top.

778
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Good flavour, that cake.
It just doesn't look great.

779
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] These do look neat.
Colour looks good.

780
00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's pretty uniform as well,
across all six.

781
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The balance between the sponge,
the cream…

782
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's good.
-…and syrup together,

783
00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-the balance is good.
-[Prue] Lovely.

784
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Moving on to number four.
Again, problems with the heat.

785
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Coming out the tins,
just needs to be higher,

786
00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-just a little bit more open.
-[Prue] It's a bit doughy.

787
00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] These look quite neat.
Cherry sits well on the top.

788
00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Nice colour.
-[Paul] They're pretty uniform.

789
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Lovely cake.
-[Paul] It is a nice cake.

790
00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Moving on.
Now, looks quite dark in places.

791
00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That caramel is a bit dominant
because it's a little darker.

792
00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This, on the other hand,
is a bit too pale.

793
00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's pale. They were rushing,
brought it out early.

794
00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Put the cream when it was piping hot,
and it just poured off side.

795
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah. It does not look a pretty thing.
-[chuckling] It doesn't.

796
00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] If you get it a little browner,
it takes away from some of the sweetness

797
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the caramel has that
just tiny little bit of bitterness.

798
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Anyway…
-We're going from pale to very dark.

799
00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This one got stuck in the tin.

800
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But also, that's too dark.
-[Prue] Yeah.

801
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit too dark.

802
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's quite bitter.
-Mmm. And there's a lot of caramel.

803
00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's burnt.

804
00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We move on to one
that's just in the middle.

805
00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And looks really nice.
I mean, the piping's good,

806
00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
caramel colour is good.
They're even, they're all risen.

807
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The caramel's just the right level,
so it brings in the colour, the flavour.

808
00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No problem with that at all.
-Mmm.

809
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Moving on to this one. Piping's good.

810
00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Excellent.

811
00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's been put on
when it's relatively cool.

812
00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's well-balanced. You have caramel--

813
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's lovely.
-Almost toffee-like.

814
00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it balances beautifully
with the sponge.

815
00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, we move
from the sublime to number 11.

816
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Issues bringing it out,
issues with the sponge.

817
00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Didn't rise enough.

818
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Getting it out.
-Hot when the cream went on.

819
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Too hot when the cream went on.
What has happened to this?

820
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I don't think
it's properly cooked, is it?

821
00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Looks like it's been
pushed together into the tin.

822
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Moving on to the last one.

823
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We heard there was an issue
where it was dropped,

824
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so this one being the neatest one,
we'll take that as a template.

825
00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Yeah.
-[Paul] They look dark

826
00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
down the side there, almost burnt.

827
00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not because it was dropped.

828
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue laughs]
-[Paul] It's been over-caramelised.

829
00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But they've got a nice height to them.

830
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. Delicious.

831
00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue will now</i>

832
00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In 12th place is this one.

833
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Linda.

834
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you know what,
there's only one way now.

835
00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's up from here, isn't it?

836
00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eleventh spot is this one.

837
00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very bitter. That caramel
had gone way over the top.

838
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You had a problem with it sticking.
-Then, number ten is this one.

839
00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Loriea. This is the opposite of that one.
It's just a little too pale.

840
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>Dave is ninth, Mak eighth,</i>

841
00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

842
00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In third spot, we have this one.

843
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Good consistency across the board
and the sponge was very, very good.

844
00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

845
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we have this one. Who is that?

846
00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Peter. It is pretty well faultless.

847
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But a smidgen below the winner.

848
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which leaves first place.

849
00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, Sura. They're very, very good.

850
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pipe work was beautiful and smooth,
the sponge, the caramel. Well done.

851
00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was bittersweet
because I feel so sad for Dave.

852
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I wish it didn't happen, to be honest.

854
00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is a bit of a crackerjack of a day.
I'm, er… I'm pretty pleased.

855
00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't like making big mistakes.
That was a big mistake.

856
00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They asked for
a pineapple upside-down cake

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think Loriea.
She had that bubble gum idea.

874
00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

875
00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that's always the worst,
is to go home right at the beginning.

880
00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

they'll just walk off into the distance,

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

head and shoulders of a person,

899
00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we're asking them to be engineers,
decorators and bakers.

900
00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The big risk with a challenge like this

901
00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

too much buttercream,

902
00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which will be too heavy,
make it too sweet,

903
00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
even if it makes it look fantastic.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For me, the secret with this challenge is

905
00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the structure they're gonna use
to put the cake onto.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1220
00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stand it up the back.

1221
00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's it.

1222
00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had to put, like, a…

1223
00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, it looks like a travel cushion.

1224
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] It's okay. They said
you can use inedible supports.

1225
00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rowan, would you like
to bring up your showstopper?

1228
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The choux buns were a bit
of a disaster, so I had to improvise.

1229
00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] There's a pattern here.

1230
00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause you promised us almost
a Parthenon yesterday, we didn't get.

1231
00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Promised us choux buns, we haven't got.
-No.

1232
00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Say less and then do more.

1233
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-[Paul] Having said that,

1234
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you instantly recognise who it is.

1235
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's absolutely brilliant.

1236
00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Rowan] Thank you.
-I hope she tastes nice.

1237
00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, so do I.

1238
00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Gonna go through her cheek.
-Yeah.

1239
00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

1240
00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you brute.

1241
00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] It's a chocolate cake
with kirsch-soaked cherries.

1243
00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm! Cherry flavour's lovely.

1244
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would've been nice to have the choux buns,
but overall I think you made a tasty cake.

1245
00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done, Rowan.

1246
00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] Well, I have to say,
he is recognisable.

1247
00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Definitely.
-Thank you.

1248
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That sort of slightly
anxious look is very Louis Theroux.

1249
00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is a coconut and lime sponge
with a chocolate orange buttercream.

1250
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You get all the flavours,
the orange, lime, coconut.

1251
00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's over-baked, bone dry.

1252
00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] It's obviously Bill Bryson.

1253
00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's good. I love the detail on it.

1254
00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Prue] And what's inside it?

1255
00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a lemon Madeira with red currant jam.

1256
00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Lovely flavour, but it's very dry.
-[Paul] And that's a real shame.

1257
00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I'd like to have seen a mouth on it.

1258
00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause Marley was known for his voice
and he hasn't got a mouth.

1259
00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[all laugh]
-I know.

1260
00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think it's delicious.
-[Prue] It is.

1261
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's got all elements
of a good sponge.

1262
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can't go wrong
with citrus flavours and a lemon curd.

1263
00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very dramatic.
He's got wonderful athlete's shoulders.

1264
00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He really looks as if he's puffing.
And I love the helmet.

1265
00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's clever, and a good get out,

1266
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because, wearing a helmet
and a mask, you know who it is.

1267
00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, Sir Chris has got
many, many Olympic medals.

1268
00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what he wore when he did it.

1269
00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's excellent.
-Let me just…

1270
00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, Chris.

1271
00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I was worried about this.
I thought Victoria sandwich

1272
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and fresh cream is all
quite light and easily squashed,

1273
00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you'd end up with a pudding inside.

1274
00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you haven't. It looks lovely.

1275
00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Italian meringue
buttercream is delicious.

1276
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:03.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The strawberries,
the cream, the sponge is spot on.

1277
01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It feels really fresh. Light.

1278
01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's delicious. The concept is great.

1279
01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it's witty.

1280
01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue and Paul] Well done, Peter.

1281
01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I think it's like a caricature.
So it's really good.

1283
01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mint and strawberry
with a cocoa buttercream.

1284
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bit toothpaste-y.

1285
01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The mint is so strong.

1286
01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it has that very chemical taste.

1287
01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's a shame.

1288
01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let yourself down
on the texture and flavour.

1289
01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, okay.

1290
01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, that's about as far away
from David Bowie as you could get.

1291
01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'd agree with you.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1295
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's quite dense.

1296
01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Slightly over-baked.

1297
01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1298
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But it's a great flavour. Good effort.

1299
01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The fact that you put "Guess who?" on this

1300
01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
must mean
you don't think it looks like her.

1301
01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1302
01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your work with the fondant
is absolutely exquisite.

1303
01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I thought it was real.

1304
01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] So let's hope
it's as good inside as it is outside.

1305
01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope so.

1306
01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's such a rich chocolate cake.
It's delicious.

1308
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll sit down
and have a slice of that anytime.

1309
01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] You can see who it is.

1310
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1311
01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is a ginger spice sponge
with a coconut buttercream.

1312
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely, very good flavour.

1313
01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's nice to see
you haven't overdone it with spices.

1314
01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got spices you can identify.

1315
01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it marries beautifully
with the ginger.

1316
01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a well-baked cake.

1317
01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
We've got a picture
of her in front of us now.

Erm, it has got a chilli chocolate sponge
flavoured with Scotch bonnet chilli powder

1325
01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chilli's a bit overwhelming.

1326

that you could lower chilli a little.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's coming in waves.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But when you've got
a wave of ginger as well,

1330
01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's really, really strong.

1331
01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, this is lining up
with what happened yesterday, as well.

[Paul] Very neat on the shirt,
very neat on the face.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you can see who it is.
Let's have a look, shall we?

1339
01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Paul] It's not dry, which is good.
It's nice and moist.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

something that looks like him.

1345
01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite smart, it's neat.
You've done a good job.

1346
01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1349
01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was all going really well.
His jacket looked great and everything.

1350
01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then the head exploded.

1351
01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:38.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think, erm, but, I'm hoping
that the flavours will redeem.

1352
01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1353
01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1355
01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, that is delicious.

1356
01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1357
01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think one of the reasons it squashed
so easily is it is very moist.

1358
01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1359

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The flavour's good.
The elderflower's there.

1362
01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks the way it does,
but it tastes really nice.

1363
01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you can identify who it is.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:08.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My biggest fear today
was that they'd say the cake was bland.

1370
01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:30.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause then I knew I was going home.
I think I've hopefully pulled it back.

1371
01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Loriea] I baked it how I like it,

1372
01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:36.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so it's too late
to cross fingers and toes now.

1373
01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kind of thought before that
came together today that that was it.

1374
01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But, if it is, I'm going out on a high.

1375
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobody wants to be the first.

1376
01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Coming on this show, I said
that I don't want to be the first.

1377
01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But maybe that was my challenge,
to accept being the first to go.
