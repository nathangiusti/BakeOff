I wanted to say how this show
has inspired me to bake for myself.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Hi. Do us a favour.
I'm looking for Prue's cake,

8
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's a beautifully decorated,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, no, erm, not seen
anything like that at all, not at all.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I know what dauphinoise is.
What's the other word?

Bit of a plumbing issue happening.

Then we lift.
Oh, look, it's just split. It's broke.

[Nicky] We'll let you go.

34
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shall I lead the way?

35
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Nicky] I actually like pastry.

36
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I find it quite therapeutic.

37
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love walking in.

39
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I never feel confident about anything
in my life and pastry's no exception.

40
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm just gonna roll with it
as I do every week.

41
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] There's a lot
that can go wrong with pastry.

42
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It will be interesting,
especially with two people going home.

43
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Cristy] I would love to,

44
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and get Star Baker would be a dream.
I don't know if it'll happen.

45
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have made it to Pastry Week,
which means you lot are the upper crust.

46
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Now,
for your signature challenge,

47
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the judges would love you to make
12 individual savoury picnic pies.

48
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The fillings and flavours
are entirely your choice,

49
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but your pies must be made
from hot water crust pastry,

50
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and be attractive
and tempting to eat just like me.

51
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laugh]

52
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's plenty of hot water,
so don't worry about that.

53
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even though someone here
had a 90-minute shower this morning.

54
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul!

55
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have two hours.

56
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which is what Paul says
when he gets in the shower.

57
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

58
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] On your marks…
-Get set…

59
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake.

60
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know that I need
to get off to a rapid start.

61
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the hot water crust pastry.

62
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hot water crust pastry
is traditionally made with lard.

63
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good for the hips, lard.

64
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The other element is butter
and that brings flavour.

65
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] You make it by pouring
almost boiling water

66
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and melted fat into the flour.

67
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm hot potato-ing right now. [laughs]

68
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] This is my onion and spring onions.

69
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gotta put stuff inside that's A,
gonna be moist to the mouth,

70
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and B, gonna carry
a lot of punchy flavours.

71
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I love a sausage.

72
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The last thing is you want
a beautiful bit of crimping on the lid,

73
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which seals in
whatever the bakers are gonna put inside.

74
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] You need to
drop the lid into the pie.

75
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The lid gets trapped in there
and it won't rise up and fall off.

76
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] As long as it's consistent

77
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and seals the lid to the side,
that's good.

78
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No pressure.

79
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Morning, Star Baker.
-[laughs] Morning.

80
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hello, Matty.
-Hello, morning.

81
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, Matty, tell us

82
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, it's got ricotta and feta,
er, bit of garlic, some…

83
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-I'm glad you said it.

86
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't be cruel, Paul.
-Span-a-di-kopa-da?

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] No, that went too quick.

307
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit soggy on the bottom.
Never been soggy before.

308
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you only have one minute left.

309
00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They've gotta come out, haven't they?

310
00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dana] That one looks peng.

311
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Not as crispy as I'd like them.

312
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] Pleased with those.

313
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rowan] It was going so well.

314
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're not great. Gutted.

315
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I can't wait
for his beady eyes to look at these.

316
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, that is your time up,
please step away from your bakes.

317
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

318
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] One of 'em has no bottom,
they're stuck in the tin.

319
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Hiya.

325
00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are based on spanakopita.

326
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Okay.
-[Matty] Based on them.

327
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Bit messy.

328
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very tricky to get that lattice
looking good on such a small pie.

329
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, there's some feta, ricotta, spinach,

330
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
roasted red peppers

331
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good strong flavours. Lovely.

332
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think your lid

333
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-[Paul] That takes up

334
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-a third of it.
-[Prue] Yeah.

335

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

-Well done.

337
00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Beautiful golden brown colour.

338
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we've got sausage meat,
bacon and cranberry with apple

339
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

340
00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Good pastry.

341
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your mustard bottom,
which I'd never have thought of,

342
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I think it's a little mark of genius.
It's beautiful.

343
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's filled beautifully,
it's nice and thin round the outside.

344
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

345
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry's a little pale on top.
Could have been browner.

346
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Bit of a soggy bottom.
-Really?

347
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah.

348
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Heartbreaking.

349
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Inside, it's tuna, potatoes,
leeks, carrot and onion,

350
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and there is a quail egg as well.

351
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the flavours.

352
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, the filling inside
is quite nice and moist.

353
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The pastry needs
to be much thinner.

354
00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And less soggy.

355
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can see right down the bottom
how wet that is there.

356
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit ripped
and all over the place at the sides.

357
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your flavours are beautiful.
You pastry is nice and flaky.

358
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nice and thin round the outside,
well-filled.

359
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's just a bit dry on the mouth.
-Okay.

360
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the flavour, but it'll be
hard work to eat that whole pie

361
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-because it's very dense.
-Okay.

362
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I think they look
really appetising.

363
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they were in a shop window,
I'd buy them.

364
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is potato dauphinoise
with caramelised onions and Comté cheese.

365
00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:08.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Your sides are a little thick
on one side, thin on another.

366
00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your roof is a little bit too thick.

367
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-I like the flavour. Thank you.

368
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, guys.

369
00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My, erm, pies…

370
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laugh]

371
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry, but…

372
00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it's, erm… That's good.

373
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Er, my pies are, kind of,
Christmas stuffing pies

374
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with chestnut, cranberry sauce,

375
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
sweet potato,
bit of bacon and a loose top.

376
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Lovely pastry.
-Thank you.

377
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got such a beautiful aroma
as well as flavour.

378
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] If it had looked a bit better,

379
00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-you'd have had an absolute triumph.
-[Paul] Hmm.

380
00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's bled quite a bit.

381
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the bleeding from the interior.

382
00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think they're quite sweet.

383
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So that's sausage meat in there
with some strong cheddar cheese,

384
00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
erm, tiny bit of apple on top.

385
00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the problem with sausage mix.

386
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It'll all shrink
and you get gaps around the edge.

387
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could've put a jelly in there.

388
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

389
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Otherwise, your flavours are good.
-Thank you.

390
00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] A little pale,
but I love the shape.

391
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The mould has worked nicely,

392
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
got a good colour underneath,
not on the side.

393
00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your pastry's a bit thick.

394
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you end up
with a big hole in it as well.

395
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, a little undercooked too.
-It is.

396
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what you've got is quite a gloopy
mixture with your pastry being too thick,

397
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it's a difficult thing to eat.

398
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a disaster.
-[Prue] It's…

399
00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's not your best.
-[Nicky] No.

400
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A bit gluey.
-[Nicky] Yeah.

401
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you very much, Nicky.
-Thank you.

402
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't worry about those people.
-It's all right.

403
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not bakers, those people.
-[both chuckle]

404
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] They look even.
They're nice and brown.

405
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're really tiny, but elegant.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've made creamy leek mushroom pies.

407
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, you're so clever.

408
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You made a creamy sauce, and it just
holds the whole thing together.

409
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, thank you.

410
00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's beautifully moist inside and crispy.

411
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm.

412
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what I will do…

413
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[gasps] You're joking.
-[applause]

414
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-[Prue] Well done.

415
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's because you managed
to achieve the moistness and the flavour

416
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in a small area
and have that lattice top looking so nice.

417
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I feel like I'm in a dream, thank you.
-Well done.

418
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] Oh, my God.

419
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's so easy to feel
impostor syndrome of like,

420
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"I'm not good enough" and stuff,

421
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then Paul goes and gives you
a handshake, and you're just like,

422
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"What?" [laughs]

423
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] I'm so happy
they like how it tasted

424
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because, you know, looks is one thing.

425
00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's inside is what matters.

426
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Saku] Oh, dear.

427
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Soggy bottom.

428
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why it happened to me today?

429
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolute bag of pants.

430
00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've just gotta scoop myself off the floor
and get on with it.

431
00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[buzzing]

432

[Alison] <i>For the next challenge,</i>
<i>the ingredients and recipe</i>

433
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>are a gingham-guarded secret.</i>

434
00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello, bakers, welcome back to the tent.

435
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's time for your technical challenge.
This week it's been set for you

436
00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
by P. Hollywood, the pastry king.

437
00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now as always, this challenge is judged
blind so our judges will be leaving.

438
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But before you go, have you got
any words of advice for our bakers?

439
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm thinking Mel Gibson in <i>Braveheart.</i>

440
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go for it, Paul.

441
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The textures on the inside
and the outside must be perfect.

442
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not as stirring as I thought,
if I'm honest.

443
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He should've done it on a horse.
-[Alison] Maybe.

444
00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison and Noel laugh]

445
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, judges, you can go. Thank you.

446
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul would like you to make
a decadent dauphinoise pithivier.

447
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Now, the judges will be looking

448
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for a buttery, crisp rough puff pastry

449
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
encasing creamy potato
and caramelised onion.

450
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And alongside that, a blue cheese sauce.

451
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have two hours and 45 minutes.

452
00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison] On your marks…

453
00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get set…
-Bake!

454
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, goodness gracious. What is this?

455
00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dana] What were the chances
that was gonna happen?

456
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know what dauphinoise is.
What's the other word?

457
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rowan] Pithivi…

458
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pervivi… pervivi… How do you say it?

459
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, Paul, pithivier?

460
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a classic sort of French pie.

461
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now this particular one's got
the dauphinoise potatoes inside.

462
00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What we're really testing the bakers on
is the pastry itself.

463
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By now, our bakers should know
about rough puff pastry.

464
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, the key thing
when you're making a rough puff

465
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is to add some frozen butter
in between each turn.

466
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dough, butter, dough, butter,
creates these flaky layers.

467
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a bit of a feast, isn't it?

468
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Help yourself to the sauce.

469
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Roquefort's such a salty blue cheese,
adds a lot of flavour.

470
00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's really heaven.
This is carbs on carbs served with cream.

471
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can't wait to get back in the tent

472
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and have nine versions of this.
-[laughs]

473
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It says, "Make the rough puff pastry."

474
00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going to add some water,
try and get a dough.

475
00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just to bind the dough together,
and then I can wrap it up and chill it.

476
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] You've done one of these before?
-Erm, no.

477
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh.
-But I've made dauphinoise.

478
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I've made rough puff.
So we're sort of there.

479
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There you go. Yeah.
Put it together. What do you got?

480
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Er--
-Dauphinoise. Pithivier.

481
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both laughing]

482
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just gonna get it
rolled out to a rough rectangle.

483
00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can put my grated butter in between.

484
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] So, I'm gonna grate
the, er, frozen butter onto that,

485
00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so the butter gives you that puffy rise.

486
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] <i>But a few of the bakers…</i>

487
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just kind of incorporating
the grated butter.

488
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>…are taking a different approach.</i>

489
00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rub the butter in the flour, knead it.

490
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Roll it out.

491
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they wanted me to laminate it,
put it out as a slab of butter,

492
00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so if it's grated,
maybe that should be mixed in.

493
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now I'm gonna start to fold.

494
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm nervous.

495
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, it's fold third down, third up,
turn, roll, chill.

496
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Nicky] When you look around
and see what everybody else is doing,

497
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you think, "Oh, have I done the same?"
It's a bit unnerving, isn't it?

498
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've grated all of my butter in at once.

499
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everyone else is laminating it in.

500
00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I've worked
the butter in too much.

501
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Washed your hand?
-I didn't want to.

502
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did he lift you off the ground slightly?
-[laughs] No.

503
00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What was it like?
Grabbing a big bunch of sausages?

504
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] Stop.

505
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel like the rule here is cold.

506
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'Cause puff pastry does not like heat.

507
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As soon as it gets too warm, then it
all melts and you won't get the layers.

508
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Starting with the filling
which is simmer the potatoes

509

I'm worried about the pastry.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

which I think will be enough.

521
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

So I've had to redo it.

-[Prue] A recognisable pithivier.

634
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Needs to be much higher.
It's a bit pale, though.

642
00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

654
00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

655
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

more bread-like than flaky.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

662
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Prue] This looks like an interesting pie,
but it's not a pithivier.

667
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] No. Not a dome in sight.
There's a bit of flake to that.

668
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Pastry's good.
-It needed more of a dome.

669
00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not sure what happened
to the rest of the potatoes.

670
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It seems to be a bit uneven on this one.
Not really neat.

671
00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got a flake to it.

672
00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] We're asking the bakers

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Ideally, I think it would be nice

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We want it highly-decorated,
so we're expecting a bit of latticework,

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's perfectly legitimate to dye
some of the pastry.

756
00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We wanna see something

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they need to bring it out, expose it
and show us what they've baked.

761
00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Nicky] I've got cramp in my hands.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

764
00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Dana] I've got the vision,
it's whether I can execute it well.

770
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, Cristy, tell us all
about your decorative pies.

771
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I'm gonna try and do,
like, a woodland sort of display of pies.

772
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna do a spiced apple pie,

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

and then a raspberry and frangipane pie.

779
00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. It's hard to practise
for four hours around the children,

780
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Rowan] In practice,
the bottom fell out of my pie.

785
00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour of that's spot on.

1023
00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[sighs] Okay.
-[Paul] It's beautifully cooked. Soft.

1024
00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is the…
-[Cristy] Raspberry and frangipane.

1025
00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never had frangipane
with raspberry in it before.

1026
00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's amazing. I love that.
-[chuckles softly]

1027
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is blueberry.
-[Cristy] Yeah.

1028
00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the blueberry.
It's intense, very American.

1029
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think there are three very good pies.

1030
00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay, great.
-Well done.

1031
00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Thank you.

1032
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I would be tempted
to put a glaze on this, you know.

1033
00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just looks a bit rough and ready.
Especially this one.

1034
00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the pecan pie.

1035
00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a bit of whisky in there,
so a bit like an American pecan pie.

1036
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really like that.

1037
00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's beautifully crispy.
-[Prue] Mmm.

1038
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The mountain pie has a blueberry
sweet pastry with a chestnut layer.

1039
00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Goodness.
-[Paul] Wow, that's vibrant.

1040
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite wet inside.
The pastry is like cake.

1041
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Hmm.
-Okay.

1042
00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sunburst pie is an apricot
and ricotta pie with a sweet pastry.

1043
00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a lovely texture. Tastes delicious.
-[Paul] Hmm.

1044
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I love the tartness from the apricot.
-Thank you.

1045
00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Dan] The bottom pie
is a cherry and kirsch

1046
00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with a chocolate sweet shortcrust.

1047
00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I like the compote inside there.

1048
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I don't think
the chocolate crust works with it.

1049
00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit sandy and dry.

1050
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Next one.
-[Dan] A grape and strawberry.

1051
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But grapes on their own
are very subtle in flavour, so it's lost.

1052
00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] And the top pie
is mango, papaya and pineapple

1053
00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with a lemon and lime sweet shortcrust.

1054
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The textures on the base
are lovely.

1055
00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not sure of the textures of the fruit
'cause they're not right.

1056
00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Needed more cooking.
-Not hitting my heights.

1057
00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
So this is my tree.

1058
00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got a baklava pie, so we've got
pistachios, hazelnuts and walnuts

1059
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
mixed with an orange syrup
and there's a frangipane filling on top.

1060
00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is delicious, but it's very rich.

1061
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's very sweet.
-Mmm-hmm.

1062
00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The frangipane's too thick.
Means, now it's underbaked.

1063
00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] What is this one?

1064
00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dana] This is my mulled wine apple pie.

1065
00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got some blackcurrants
running through it.

1066
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Too sour?
-[Prue] Mmm-hmm.

1067
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Hits you right there.

1068
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think it is perhaps too powerful.
-Mmm-hmm.

1069
00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-They're a bit, erm--
-[Prue] Broken.

1070
00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] A little bit rustic.

1071
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] Apple and blackberry
with some cinnamon.

1072
00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Some of the top is actually raw.

1073
00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-Flavour's not bad.

1074
00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Rhubarb and custard.
-[Matty] Yeah.

1075
00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The rhubarb comes through well there.

1076
00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a very good pie.

1077
00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Reticent to try this one.
-[Prue] It's collapsed.

1078
00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Plum and some ginger.
-The fruit is undercooked.

1079
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The best one is the rhubarb and custard
by quite a margin. Thank you.

1080
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] Saku, what I really love about this
is it looks so simple and fresh.

1081
00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The big pie is pineapple, cherry and rum.

1082
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, the fruit's quite raw.

1083
00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn't go back
for a second piece.

1084
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's have a look at the apple and…
-Apple and cinnamon.

1085
00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I really like the apple.
Cinnamon level's just about right.

1086
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Pastry's nice, delicate and buttery.
-I think that's delicious. Well done.

1087
00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much.

1088
00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] That is a work of art.

1089
00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got a very simple theme,

1090
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it pulls all the pies together
most excellently.

1091
00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] It's a pineapple and apricot pie

1092
00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
spiced with cinnamon stick, star anise
and some vanilla in there.

1093
00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's really good.
-Oh, good.

1094
00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's tart, it's sweet, it's crunchy,
it's got depth to it. It's delicious.

1095
00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I can't fault that.
-Thank you.

1096
00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The leaves are made
with a coconut, apple and blackberry pie.

1097
00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's delicious.

1098
00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And the right texture.
It holds together, but it's moist.

1099
00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is what we've been looking for.

1100
00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's wonderful. Well done.

1101
00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Yes, Josh!

1102
00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] You've got Patsy pretty perfectly.

1103
00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Eddy's less successful, I think.

1104
00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eddy is filled with cherry and vanilla.

1105
00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't really…
[grunts] It's so difficult.

1106
00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rowan chuckles]

1107
00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This didn't happen at home.

1108
00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's just pouring out.
Nothing's set.

1109
00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1110
00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crisp, very short, but it looks awful.

1111
00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very clumsy.

1112
00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You can't get it out of the tin.
-Nope.

1114
00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very clumsy, and you say
they were all right at home?

1115
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Honestly, lovely, yeah.

1116
00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This one has got the opposite problem.

1117
00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rowan] This is a chocolate frangipane

1118
00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and just a standard almond frangipane
with flaked almonds.

1119
00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's very solid. Too dry.

1120
00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue and Rowan laugh]

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Success.

1122
00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I think they're all very pretty.

1123
00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've made a real effort to jolly it up.
I love that, of course.

1124
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The first one
is an apple, pear and hazelnut pie.

1125
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Never had a dry apple pie before.
-[Nicky] Oh… [laughs]

1126
00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, there's a first for everything.

1127
00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think, partially,
it's because it's so exposed.

1128
00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the moisture that was in that pie
has just evaporated off.

1129
00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The second one is rhubarb, custard
and a wee bit of ginger in there.

1130
00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Custard's worked really well.

1131
00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's pretty thick,
but it's absolutely set.

1132
00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry's too thick for the filling,
so there's hardly any filling.

1133
00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Deeper pie.
-Yeah.

1134
00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then the third one
is frangipane and plum.

1135
00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a punchy flavour and it's thin,
so you've got that,

1136
00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then the plum top
is about right as well.

1137
00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Quite a nice flavour.
-Delicious.

1138
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

1139
00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I've got take a positive that it was
sort of really short and nice pastry,

1140
00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and actually, she did say
that the flavours were good.

1141
00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] I was trying to hold it back,
"My goodness, incredible."

1142
00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, they loved it. I'm so pleased.

1143
00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If Josh got Star Baker,
I'd be over the moon for him.

1144
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But to even be in the mix
for Star Baker's, like, amazing.

1145
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] Their comments were polite
for what they could've said.

1146
00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a disaster. [chuckles]

1147
00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[buzzing]

1148
00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:42.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison] I am nervous for today.

1149
00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A double whammy.

1150
00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I know. It's painful.
-Who's it gonna be?

1151
00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We know them all so well now.

1152
00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought Rowan's pies were so awful.

1153
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It looked a little bit like soup.
-We needed a straw.

1154
00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was a bit surprised with Dana's efforts.

1155
00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think she lost her edge a little bit
in the showstopper.

1156
00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's an argument for Saku to be there,

1157
00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but has she done enough
on her showstopper to save herself?

1158
00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And Nicky's down there.
-[Noel] I feel bad for Nicky.

1159
00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think she's had
a tough week, hasn't she?

1160
00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Star Baker's
between a couple of people.

1161
00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Cristy, Josh.

1162
00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Josh's sunflower was as perfect
a piece of pastry as you could hope for.

1163
00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And Cristy, she's had…
-[Paul and Alison] Yeah.

1164
00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-…a much better week.
-Yeah.

1165
00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What happens now?
You eat the rest of the pies?

1166
00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I'm not. If I expand any more,

1167
00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll take someone's eye out
with that button.

1168
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1169
00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>Prue and Paul have decided</i>
<i>who'll be this week's Star Baker</i>

1170
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and which two bakers</i>
<i>will be leaving the competition.</i>

1171
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] Now I've got the great job
of announcing this week's Star Baker,

1172
00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and this is someone who the judges thought
was consistent throughout.

1173
00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So this week's Star Baker is…

1174
00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Cristy.
-[cheers and applause]

1175
00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-Well done.

1176
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. [chuckles]

1177
00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew that was coming.

1178
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, that means I've got the horrible job
of announcing who's leaving us.

1179
00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And, as you know,
two people will be going this week.

1180
00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the people
that are leaving us this week are…

1181
00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nicky and Rowan.

1182
00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come here. Come here. [chuckles]

1183
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Nicky] It's been a blast.
-[Paul] That wasn't your week, was it?

1184
00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What did I say? It was like a bag of pants
this week, so… [laughs]

1185
00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I had a lovely time.
-I'll miss you.

1186
00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughing] You can't stay in
after a bag of pants. There's no way.

1187
00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can I have a hug, my love?

1188
00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely gutted.

1189
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everybody's just been fab. Saying goodbye
is the worst part about this.

1190
00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not the absolute roast I got
at the showstopper.

1191
00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I promise I can bake. Oh, come here, Paul.

1192
00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Rowan went
because of that showstopper.

1193
00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, we've had a blast.

1194
00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The other person who's had
a bad week is Nicky.

1195
00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's been really sad to let them go.

1196
00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Well done.
-[Cristy] Thank you so much.

1197
00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got this boost
which I probably needed,

1198
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause I think sometimes
when you're a mum,

1199
00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
everything's for everyone else.

1200
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you sort of put your dreams on hold.

1201
00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Star Baker and a handshake.
That's more than most people get.

1202
00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it means more than Paul and Prue
maybe even could imagine.

1203
00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Next week…

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Saku] I'm very pleased
that I can come back.

1205
00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Having said that,
I need to up my game to survive.
