00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

458
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because you have got a bit of a swirl.

461
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

462
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Let's see how they look inside.

463
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't wanna look.

464
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] There's not much
of a swirl in there, is there?

465
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's like, an abstract swirl.

466
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think maybe the cream
kind of hides the swirl.

467
00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think you've got
a great blend of the spices,

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but more so the cardamom
and the coconut together

470
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My only complaint
is there's a touch too much jaggery.

472
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

476
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's pudding.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you've managed to overmix it.

You haven't over-sweetened the filling.
So you get that sour cherry.

Mmm.

508
00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I'm full of admiration for you
because on the few occasions

509
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that I've tried to use aquafaba
instead of egg whites, takes ages.

510
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, yeah. It is a bit of a faff,
isn't it, really?

511
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[all chuckling]
-[Freya] I mean…

512
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Let's see if it is
worth it, shall we?

513
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the nice tart flavour
of the raspberries.

514
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you've got a little hint
of lemon in there as well.

515
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cake is a little bit hefty.

516
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] That's got a lovely swirl.
-Thank you.

517
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like that the sponge is a little thicker

518
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because it means it's risen more.

519
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the fresh strawberries
are just delicious.

520
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're giraffe-patterned, giraffe-esque.

521
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we could even go as far to say,
the caramel drips evenly.

522
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The sea lion in a bit of water.

523
00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not the best-looking mini rolls I've seen.

524
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There was obviously a rush.

525
00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cream and the caramel's run out
'cause it's been warm when you've done it,

526
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then your flavours are all wrong.

527
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's down to the timing.

528
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I bet you did better
when you were practising.

529
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, but… Tent pressure, isn't it?

530
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Goodness, Giuseppe.
That looks as neat as a pin.

531
00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely beautiful.

532
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've come up with something
that's very elegant.

533
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cuts lovely, classic, lovely swirl.

534
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That is a perfect swirl.

535
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Classic almond cake with orange.

536
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe] Yeah.

537
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's my favourite kind of cake.
-Oh, good.

538
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's so delicate and it's so well-balanced
that it grows on you.

539
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With every mouthful,
it's getting better and better.

540
00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think your flavours are beautiful.

541
00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The orange blossom comes through,
and it's very delicate,

542
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's enough there
to create great flavour

543
00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because ricotta carries
a little bit of flavour.

544
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So between the two, it's perfect.

545
00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It's a triumph. Well done.
-Oh, God.

546
00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Giuseppe.
-Thank you.

547
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispering] Well done. Amazing.

548
00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look fantastic.

549
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let me recap.
"A triumph," "neat as a pin," "perfect…"

550
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The only problem is that
there is only one way from here.

551
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul made me eat my own cake and judge it…

552
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, crazy, crazy.

553
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They said they look terrible.
Everyone knew that anyway.

554
00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The seepage was massive.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

564
00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

565
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we're going to ask these two poppets
to leave the tent.

566
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue would like you to make
that teatime classic, the malt loaf.

569
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Served with homemade butter on the side.

570
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It should be rich and moist.

571
00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Maggie] Prue said,
"under 35s won't know what it is."

581
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course, all the under 35s said,
"Do you know what it is, Maggie?"

582
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course I do.

583
00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm over 35. Well over 35.

584
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, in theory, I should know
what this looks like.

585
00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In reality,
I haven't got the faintest clue.

586
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[hesitates] Malt loaf?

588
00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's our first technical challenge,
and you set them a malt loaf.

589
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's sticky, rich.

590
00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobody doesn't like a malt loaf.

[Paul] Where can they go wrong?

592
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because it's just a simple mix,
it's a little bit easier to undermix.

593
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And so just take trouble to make sure
that you haven't got

594
00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
any lumps of flour left in there.

595
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And under-baking it,
it's likely to sink in the middle.

596
00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And overbaked is just too hard and dry.

597
00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's perfect.

598
00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It just needs butter on it.

600
00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

is going to be hard, though.

605
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Ow, my ears.

716
00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You burst them.
-[yelling] Sorry!

717
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's better.

718
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckling] See if it's ready.

719
00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Freya] I might just give it
a few more minutes.

720
00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is nerve-wracking, isn't it?

721
00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] I don't know. Painful.

-Right.

723
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:33.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looking all right.
Probably five more minutes.

724
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

725
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I'll maybe leave it
a little bit more.

726
00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Will I? Unsure.

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Chigs] Still got a real bad wobble.
-I reckon that's done.

728
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay, that's it. Coming out.
-The cake is on the move.

729
00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks fine.

730
00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Scrumptious. So I think it's just right.

731
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Either it's done or it'll have to do.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's this really dense cake.

734
00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come out totally clear.

735
00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not totally clear.

736
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mine looks a bit doughy, innit?

737
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have one minute left.

738
00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-My God.
-[Freya] Just letting it glaze up.

739
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[George] Can't have a dry bottom.
-Oh, hot, hot, hot.

740
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got to somehow get
attractive orange on top.

741
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just need to put the butter on.

742
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-More shebang, honestly.
-[Amanda] This is a nightmare.

743
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maggie] It's really quite pretty.

744
00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up.

745
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If malt loaf is supposed to have
a split in it, then it's perfect.

746
00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope it's not raw in the middle.

747
00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, you just don't know.

748
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[George and Maggie] Who knows?

749
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[George] They could say it's overbaked.
-It looks fantastic.

750
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope it's worked out this time

751
00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please bring your malt loaves
down to the gingham table

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Maggie] Off you go.
I don't want to crash into anybody.

754
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm coming. Where's my ugly mug?

755
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Freya] Oh, I'm first. What a nightmare.

756
00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, your peel looks really nice.
Look at mine. Mine's still wet.

763
00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The butter's nice, don't you think?
-[Prue] Yeah.

769
00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

770
00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's sticky and it's got
that characteristic chew.

771
00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's well-balanced
with the fruit as well.

772
00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Now, this one looks very small.
-Let's have a look inside.

773
00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's probably going to be
a bit tough, I think.

774
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The fruit distribution is there.

775
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's just a bit bread-like.
-[Prue] Mmm.

776
00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

777
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's not very evenly distributed.
It's in lumps.

778
00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] There's almost too much fruit,
and not much of the malt loaf.

779
00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I quite like this.
-[Prue] I do, too.

780
00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's got
a nice distribution inside.

781
00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Hmm, this butter's not too salty.

782
00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's got
a bit of a chew to that one.

783
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That's lovely.

784
00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Moving on to number five,
it's got a good height.

785
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not too domed.

786
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's got good texture,
but a little bit of tension in it as well,

787
00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which I like.

788
00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Moving on, quite a strong colour on there.

789
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Lots of fruit.
-[Paul] Yeah.

790
00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's very short.

791
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that's probably been
slightly over-baked.

792
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's quite a pale colour,
but I think it's properly cooked.

793
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a bit of flour
not quite distributed evenly.

794
00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Hmm.
-Got a nice, chewy edge to it.

795
00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's sort of there. It nearly is.

796
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This has got a lot of candied peel on top.
I like that.

797
00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] I like that, too.
-[Paul] Hmm. Nice colour.

798
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice bit of tension in that one.

799
00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That's excellent.

800
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got lots of fruit,
it's got a malty taste.

801
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got lovely tension.

802
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very good.
-[Paul] Nice colour all the way round.

803
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavour's good, but on the second bite
it feels quite bready again.

804
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-[Prue] This looks a bit small.

805
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] And it's a little doughy there.
That's raw.

806
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can tell by the colour,
how light it is.

807
00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm, I think it's slightly underdone,
-[Prue] Definitely.

808
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Quite pale, but decent.
I like that look.

809
00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good blend of fruit.

810
00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Probably needed longer in the oven

811
00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it's sticking to
every bit of my mouth.

812
00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll have to take your teeth out
and clean them later.

813
00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[all chucking]
-[whispering] God, she slapped him.

814
00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Okay.
It's quite a strong colour, which I like.

815
00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was expecting something
very different to this.

1225
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was expecting something
very different to that.

1226
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite, erm, mortifying, actually.

1227
00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:42.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the sponge is perfect.
I love the flavour.

1228
00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The taste of that guava, I love it.

1229
00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the elements are there,
but there's nothing else.

1230
00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Love the little dolphins,
and I think it's beautifully done.

1231
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've certainly got
the gravity-defying bit.

1232
00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not totally convinced it does,

1233
00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because that's just
the Rice Krispies bit, isn't it?

1234
00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Paul] But I love the colour of it.

1235
00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The concept of it.

1236
00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is lemon drizzle.

1237
00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, lemon and elderflower.

1238
00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think your sponges
are slightly over-baked.

1239
00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're a little bit too dry.
Did you use an extract with that one?

1240
00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I used, erm, elderflower liqueur.
There's quite a lot in there.

1241
00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think there's a touch too much.

1242
00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's quite powerful.
-[Paul] It burns, doesn't it?

1243
00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much.

1244
00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Thank you.

1245
00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stayed up.
-It stayed up.

1246
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lizzie, would you like to bring up
your showstopper, please?

1247
00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Amanda gasps]
-[Tom] Oh, no!

1248
00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Whoops.
-[Freya] Oh, my gosh.

1249
00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles] God. Sorry.

1250
00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Paul slowly sabotaged you.

1251
00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laugh]

1252
00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit simplistic,
but it does defy gravity.

1253
00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the side of it
is a real mess, isn't it?

1254
00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It may taste fantastic yet.
-Let's hope so.

1255
00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I could happily eat a bowl of that.

1256
00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

1257
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think your flavour's nice.

1258
00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just neaten up
your work a little bit more.

1259
00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think those flowers look incredible.
You spent some time on that.

1260
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's chocolate sponge,

1261
00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kirsch buttercream,
then a little bit of cherry jam as well.

1262
00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hmm. I think that's lovely.
-Ah, awesome.

1263
00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very boozy.

1264
00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's delicious, you have got
a nice chocolatey flavour there.

1265
00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice kick from the alcohol as well.

1266
00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got some beautiful textures
running through there. And it's vegan.

1267
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you've done a great job.

1268
00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Really, really good job.
-Oh, thank you so much.

1269
00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really appreciate it.

1270
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's very elegant.
I think the pipe work is beautifully done.

1271
00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Between you and Freya, you've done
an amazing job with these flowers.

1272
01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] You certainly hit
the gravity-defying

1273
01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because you cannot believe

1274
01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that such a heavy cake
is not going to fall over.

1275
01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And just remind us about what the cake is.

1276
01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a cinnamon sponge with a vanilla
Italian meringue buttercream

1277
01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and roasted pecans.

1278
01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm. That's good.

1279
01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles] I got exactly that.

1280
01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Exactly as you said it.
-[sighs in relief]

1281
01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's absolutely
beautifully flavoured. Lovely.

1282
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The cinnamon hit
is very powerful, but it works

1283
01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because you balance that out
with the vanilla as well.

1284
01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The nuts leave
that little bit of texture as well.

1285
01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You created something
that is actually quite remarkable.

1286
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I absolutely agree.
-Thank you so much.

1287
01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-It really is lovely.

1288
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He doesn't say "remarkable" very often,
unless he's talking about himself.

1289
01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[all laughing]
-[sighs in relief]

1290
01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, well done, Crystelle.
-[softly] Well done.

1291
01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You definitely got
the excitement in there.

1292
01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You probably could have done
with a little bit more detail.

1293
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Look at that,
apple and caramel. How lovely.

1294
01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, your flavours are lovely.
-Thank you.

1295
01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The antigravity is certainly there.
It needs to be a little bit more honed.

1296
01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1297
01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to say I'm a bit disappointed
about the gravity-defying bit.

1298
01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was a bit of a disaster, to be honest.

1299
01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a lemon and almond cake.

1300
01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's rather more almond than lemon.
-Yeah.

1301
01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although there is a little bit of a lean,
there's no way that's defying gravity.

1302
01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fair enough.

1303
01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It is simply beautiful,
and it's certainly gravity-defying,

1304
01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
especially as you've got
the cloud off-centre.

1305
01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
So that really makes you feel
this should fall over.

1306
01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's a great kids' cake.
Let's have a look.

1307
01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

1308
01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The inside of the cake
is like an inside sponge

1309
01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with a raspberry jam
and a cream cheese buttercream.

1310
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The sponge is a little dry.
-Okay.

1311
01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good flavour though. Really good.

1312
01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Flavour's superb.

1313
01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because of the size of the cake,
I would've put two layers in there.

1314
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. Okay.

1315
01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's true. If you'd had three
layers of sponge and a bit more filling,

1316
01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you wouldn't have noticed
the dryness so much.

1317
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a pity, because you've
absolutely nailed the illusion bit.

1318
01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think it's so elegant, don't you?
-Yeah.

1319
01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's so clean and simple,
but beautifully done.

1320
01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Is the cake in this?
-Yes.

1321
01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is. So, this is the rod support.
And then you…

1322
01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With a plinth and you
put the cake on that?

1323
01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Er, yes, and I've got
two more supporting discs inside.

1324
01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's well-engineered.

1325
01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:01.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] The cake is an orange

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with a hint of rose and pistachio praline.

1327
01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm glad you said hint,
because rose can be so strong.

1328
01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

1329
01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got the rose absolutely right.

1330
01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can hardly taste it, but it's there.

1331
01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's beautiful because the chiffon's
quite a light sponge.

1332
01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then you've got texture
coming from the nuts

1333
01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which gives you a beautiful flavour.
And in the background,

1334
01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you've got this rose floating through.

1335
01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So technically,
the way you baked it is perfect.

1336
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could become the flavour king.

1337
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very, very good.
-Thank you very much.

1338
01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Crystelle whispers] Well done.
-[Freya] Well done, so good.

1339
01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Smashed it. Smashed it.

1340
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs in relief]

1341
01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

1342
01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] It's still sinking in.
I can't believe it.

1343
01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a very happy Jürgen indeed.

1344
01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I really thought my cake was raw,
and they cut it,

1345
01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:59.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I was like, "Oh, my God, it's raw."
And it wasn't!

1346
01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:04.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, blimey. It's the worst bake
I've ever done. That was pretty bad.

1347
01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jairzeno] To be honest,
I expect to go home

1348
01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it doesn't even have
an antigravity element.

1349
01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[George] I just think week one's nerves
just got the better of me.

1350
01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:15.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hope I don't go, but I think I might be,
you know, going home.

1351
01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I absolutely want to stay.
Of course I want to stay.

1352
01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a great bunch of people.

1353
01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never been able to sit
and talk to someone in detail about cake

1354
01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and not bore the pants off them. [laughs]

1355
01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[bees buzzing]

1356
01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>Prue and Paul</i>
<i>have made their decision.</i>

1357
01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't wanna get emotional.
-No, come on.

1358
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Well done, bakers.

1359
01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Luckily I've got the amazing job
of announcing the first Star Baker.

1360
01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the Star Baker this week is…

1361
01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jürgen.

1362
01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I have a job that no one wants,

1363
01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's a real shame
because we've only just met

1364
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and we're already losing one of the gang.

1365
01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry to say that
the first person to be leaving us is…

1366
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Tom.
-Absolutely. That's fair enough.

1367
01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

1368
01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did not go to plan at all. [laughs]

1369
01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, dear. Hey. Thank you very much.

1370
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I always have been harder on myself
than I really should be,

1371
01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I definitely am proud of myself,
and I never say that.

1372
01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So that must mean quite a bit.

1373
01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll mostly miss spending time
with all the lovely bakers.

1374
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're really talented
and absolutely lovely people.

1375
01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm so gonna miss
hanging out with them every day.

1376
01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] You see, you can do it, can't you?
-[Amanda] Thank you so much.

1377
01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was absolutely thinking
I was gonna go first,

1378
01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I'm really sad for Tom,
he's such a gentleman. I love him.

1379
01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's such a nice man.

1380
01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
George, lift it up a bit.

1381
01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm in shock.

1382
01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just so pleased that the judges
have seen something in my baking,

1383
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I'm here for another week.

1384
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue and Paul] Well done, Jürgen.
-Thank you. Thank you very much.

1385
01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] So good. Really.
-[Jürgen] Thank you. Thank you.

1386
01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is incredible. It is incredible.

1387
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Er, before, I thought, "Star Baker, hmm,
doesn't matter too much."

1388
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I feel so…

1389
01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoo! [laughs]

1390
01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Crystelle] Well done!
-[indistinct chatter]

1391
01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so excited, yes.

1392

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobody at home?
