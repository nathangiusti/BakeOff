[Dan] I'm absolutely
over the moon to be here.

21
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Worst-case scenario,
you've made it to the semi-finals.

22
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Best-case, I go to the finals.

23
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All the best, dudes. Let's do it today.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Boom!

25

[Tasha] I'm so proud of how far I've come.

27
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in such a short space of time
is, yeah, it's amazing.

28
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] The nerves are really big.

29
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I never in a million years
would've imagined I could get this far.

30
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So a place in the final would be amazing.

31
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matty] Week nine, it's so bizarre.

32
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm looking around
at the other three and I'm thinking,

33
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"What am I doing here?" [laughs]

34
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've not labelled it semi-final,
I've just thought about what I need to do.

35
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello, bakers, welcome back to the tent.

36
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unfortunately, today,
Alison's a little bit poorly

37
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and she won't be joining us,
but she'll be back soon.

38
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, the good news
is you've all made it to the semi-final.

39
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bad news is
it's Patisserie Week. [laughs]

40
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, the judges would love you to make
two batches of 12 financiers.

41
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your financiers should be worthy
of a Parisian patisserie window,

42
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and they can be any flavour you like.

43
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have two hours
to complete this challenge.

44
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On your marks, get set, bake.

45
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is very quiet in the tent.
Everyone's got game faces on.

46
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everyone's very serious.

47
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Time is so important this week.

48
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need it to make it look decent.

49
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs] Patisserie,
patisserie, patisserie.

50
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm ready. I'm ready for the challenge.

51
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Our signature bake is a financier.

52
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A classic financier
is a little sponge cake

53
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that looks like a little gold bar.

54
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They always have ground nuts in there,
usually ground almonds,

55
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and they usually have brown butter.

56
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And brown butter
is just butter that is heated

57
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
until it's on the point of burning.

58
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Burn, my beauty, burn.

59
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It gives the sponge a really nutty,
very rich flavour.

60
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Financiers should be quite moist inside,
but light at the same time.

61
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite tricky
to get them absolutely spot on.

62
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're asking them to
highly decorate their financiers.

63
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Normally, it's just a sponge.

64
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we want them
to take the financier to another level.

65
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a semi-final,
we're looking for perfection,

66
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
elegance, and beautiful flavours.

67
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

68
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello, Dan.

69
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hello.
-Good morning.

70
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, Dan,
tell us all about your financiers.

71
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, for my first batch, I am doing
pistachio with matcha and pink peppercorn.

72
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Matcha?

73
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's only one teaspoon
of matcha going in it.

74
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Why are you putting it in at all?

75
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because it lends flavour
to the pistachio--

76
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul absolutely loves matcha.

77

-No.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

85
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

88

Not only are you trying to win this,
but trying to break Paul Hollywood.

89
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, well, he's done a good job of
breaking me, so I'm trying to fight back.

They're inspired by puddings, so one
of them's gonna be Bakewell flavoured.

[Matty] He's very clever.
He probably checks his oven.

202
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Unlike me. [laughs]
-Dan won't notice till it's too late.

203
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

204
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fridge and oven. She's good.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This'd be more fun
than the actual show if we did this.

207
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

208
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, good.

209
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's the semi-finals, guys.

210
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Let's dig deep.

211
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] <i>A perfectly-baked financier</i>

212
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] Yeah. I'm really pleased with them.

213
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good. Skewer comes out nice and clean.

214
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tasha] Coffee and hazelnut sponges,
I think, are done.

215
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pistachio ones
are in for another five minutes-ish.

[Dan] You don't wanna
overbake these batches,

218
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because they'll be tough as old boots
as Paul likes to say.

219
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] I'll give 'em
another minute or two.

220
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tasha] Pistachio sponges
are really deceptive.

221
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They look like they're done, but they're
sometimes stodgy in the middle.

222
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think
I've overbaked so far in practice.

223
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's still time, I guess.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[whistles] Lot going on here.

226
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, a fair bit.
I've skewered some hazelnuts.

227
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

228
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Noel] Oh, soft. No.

229
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

230
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Imagine if I'm good at it,
I'll have to start baking.

231
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, I think we're ready to go.
We can begin with the decoration.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

238
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you can put tiny slices
of slipping and sliding peach

239
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

240
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

244
00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's dark enough for me.

245
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

246
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I don't know if that's baked enough.

247
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

249
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gonna be extremely,
extremely close, this.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] I wanna cut out
a little wedge for the ganache.

251
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I hope that's cooked.

252
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] I'm just gonna
get this yuzu gel on here.

253
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tasha] This is
my chocolate coffee ganache.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] I've put the chocolate
in the middle and then pipe over the top.

255
00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

come on since you've been in this show?

256
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, er, probably.

257
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I was no good at it before
and now I'm, like, not as no good.

258

-[Josh] Not too bad.
-[Tasha] Buttercream's curdled. [sighs]

260
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't have any other choice but to pipe.
Got no time.

261
00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

263
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tasha] Oh, it's so curdled.

264
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I really wish I had time

265
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Got a bit of colour on my,
er, raspberries. [exhales]

270
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

272
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

276
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Straight off the bat, they look good.

277
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's start with coffee.

279
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, there's a chocolate ganache,
coffee liqueur

280
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and vanilla cream with some walnuts.

281
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like it. Pretty strong.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I really like your flavours.
I do think it's overbaked.

283
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Overbaked.

284
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a little bit dry and I expect
a bit of moisture there and it isn't.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Paul] Let's have a look at the…

286
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matty] Mango, lime and coconut.

287
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

289
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know what?
You didn't have to make them so thick.

290
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could've halved the sponge.

291
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that's right. It's actually
too much cake versus topping.

292
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[laughs]

294
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] Grown-up favours.

295
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[softly] Well done.
-[softly] Thank you. [chuckles]

296
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] On first glance,
they look absolutely lovely.

301
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then the ganache
is chocolate and coffee.

302
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Hmm.

303
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that is
absolutely delicious, Tasha.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks.
-[Prue] Melts in the mouth.

305
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The ganache
is really luxurious and decadent.

306
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the flavours, they're spot on,
and more importantly, the bake is perfect.

307
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A little bit of moisture in there
which holds on the tongue. Delicious.

308
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-[Prue] Good.

309
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is pistachio?

310
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pistachio sponge with raspberry
Swiss meringue buttercream.

311
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love raspberry and pistachio together.

312
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sponge has just
that little bit of resistance.

313
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think it's slightly overbaked?

314
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has gone slightly over, unfortunately.

315
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it could've been much neater
on that one. Thank you.

316
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done.

317
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[mouthing] Well done.
-Thank you.

318
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] They look good.

319
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think your size might be a bit tall.
Just a little bit.

320
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This one's a Bakewell-inspired financier

321
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with custard flavoured
Italian meringue buttercream on top.

322
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did you add almond essence as well?
-Just a fraction, yeah.

323
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A tiny bit too much.

324
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It should be a hint,
and it's quite overwhelming.

325
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It tastes delicious.

326
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's got that thing that I love
which is the slight chewiness.

327
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nice and moist and soft in the middle.
-[Paul] Yeah.

328
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look at your chocolate.

329
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] Hazelnut chocolate and orange

330
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with a chocolate Italian meringue
buttercream on top.

331
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flavour is delicious. However,
the financier itself is slightly dry.

332
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A financier should melt in the mouth.

333
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's great flavour.

334
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Can't complain. Flavour's good.
-[Josh] Thank you.

335
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They do look beautiful.
-[Prue] Very neat.

336
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were worrying about finesse,
they look beautiful.

337
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Paul] They do look good.

338
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think we'll have a look
at the Japanese-inspired one first.

339
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the tonka bean
with the pink peppercorn

340
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and pistachio and matcha and…
-[Prue] Everything else.

341
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's beautiful.

342
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is… Is it?
-[Paul] Clever. Yeah.

343
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Matcha hits right at the end.
Tonka bean's there.

344
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The choice of fruit, I like on there.

345
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is delicious, all of it.

346
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, thank you. [exhales sharply]

347
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Let's look at the peach, orange…

348
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] And raspberry.
-Yeah.

349
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Hmm.

350
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's beautiful. Really nice.
-[Dan] Oh.

351
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like a celebration of citrus,
it pops and it's beautifully baked.

352
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got moisture there,
that's the perfect financier for me.

353
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's a triumph. Well done, Dan.

354
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much.

355
00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:12.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a time to get a handshake.

356
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That went a bit better than expected.

357
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a lot of chat
about getting a handshake off Paul.

358
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd like a fist pump off Prue,

359
00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I might see
if we can get one off her tomorrow.

360
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dan's done amazing.

361
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've known that patisserie is his week.
The one that he's been looking forward to.

362
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's shown that straight away.

363
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No redemption, but that's okay.

364
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Every week,
I feel like I learn a little bit more

365
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and every week I'm reminded
that I know nothing.

366
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought they was underbaked. [laughs]

367
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nope, over. [laughs]

368
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] <i>One bake down, two to go,</i>

370
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Welcome back to the tent.

371
00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Today, your technical challenge has been
set for you by the wonderful Prue.

372
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prue, any words of advice?

373
00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This recipe is so delicious,
you can hardly go wrong with the flavour.

374
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:12.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, what Paul and I are going to be
looking for is exquisite presentation.

375
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As ever, this technical challenge
will be judged blind,

376
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so we're gonna have to ask
these two joyous poppets…

377
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckling]
-…to leave the tent. [laughing]

378
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For your technical challenge,
Prue would love you to make

379
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a tarte aux pommes.

380
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you didn't do GCSE French,
that is an apple tart.

381
00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your apple tart should consist
of a short buttery pastry case

382
00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
filled with a smooth almond frangipane
and apple purée

383
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
topped with glazed apple slices,

384
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
arranged in a way
that's very pleasing to the eye.

385
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have two and a half hours.

386
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On your marks, get set, bake.

387
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] Had a feeling
it'd be something like this.

388
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't remember
how to do it, though. [laughs]

389
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tasha] This is giving me
strong memories of Pie Week.

390
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Blind baking went wrong in Pie Week.
Pie Week? Pastry Week.

391
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] Really don't wanna
cock this one up like last week.

392
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Four weeks ago, you'd finish fourth
and be like, "Get in there."

393
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, you finish fourth,
it's like doomsday.

394
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tarte aux pommes is a great challenge
for the semi-final.

395
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's my favourite dessert. [laughs]
I absolutely love it.

396
00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, to get
a perfect apple tart like this,

397
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it has to go in the oven three times.

398
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
First for the blind bake,
and that's the most important one,

399
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
otherwise, you'll get a soggy bottom.

400
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] That's the thing
that starts to achieve the correct colour.

401
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They then bake again a layer of frangipane
just to set it a bit,

402
00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then they add the apple purée
and the apples to bake.

403
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's about the finesse.

404
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The apples have to be really, really thin,
otherwise, A, they don't get baked enough,

405
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and secondly, they look all clumsy.

406
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it has
three tablespoons of Calvados in it.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to see how cautious they are.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

456
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm saying that like I know
what three mil looks like.

457
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's about a pound thickness.

458
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

459
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

do a bit of DIY work down here.

462
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna use all of these beans,
try and get them into the corners.

463
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Doesn't tell you how long to bake it for,
it just tells you to bake it at 170.

464
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

465
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe 12 minutes for a blind bake.

466
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

see how it's doing. Check again.

470

471
00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Twenty minutes.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so if the pastry isn't baked
when the filling goes in,

474
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think it'll ever bake.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fangipaney? Frangipane, frangipane?

477
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have never made frangipane before.

478
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's cream, butter, sugar,
mix in egg and almonds.

479
00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

480
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flavouring it with apple brandy. Calvados.

481
00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm thinking a tablespoon.

482
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want to get the flavour
without affecting the mixture,

483
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because it might get runny.

484
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna go half a tablespoon.

485

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

487
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

615
00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] But a bit soggy there. Right.

616
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Now moving on to this,
erm, disaster.

617
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This struggled to come out of the tin.

618
00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it looks very messy.

619
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think this perhaps
wasn't baked blind enough.

620
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] There's no colour on that.

621
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] No, it's very raw.

622
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. The flavour's okay.

623
00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pastry's let it down a little bit.

624
00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Right.
-[Paul] This is quite neat.

625
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got a bit of a split there.

626
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the worst bit's been put that way,
I'd do exactly the same if it was me.

627
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That melts in the mouth, that pastry.

628
00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's delicious.

629
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The apples
are nicely thinly sliced.

630
00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're nicely arranged.

631
00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it's lovely.

632
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] <i>Prue and Paul will now rank</i>
<i>the apple tarts from worst to first.</i>

633
00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In fourth place we have this one.

634
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tash, big problem with the pastry.

635
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It fell apart, and the shape
wasn't as good as I expected.

636
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-And in third place we have this one.

637
00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dan, it looked a bit clumsy,
and the pastry had cracked a little.

638
00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it was delicious.

639
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In second place we have this one,
whose is this?

640
00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Matty, pretty good actually.

641
00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very, very neat. It just needed
a little longer in the oven.

642
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very, very good.

643
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which means, Josh, this is the best one.

644
00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was absolutely lovely.

645
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[indistinct chatter]

646
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
First in a technical,
it's taken nine weeks,

647
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but got one now, so I'm over the moon.

648
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm really pleased.

649
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I saw Josh's, to be fair, and I thought,
"Yeah, that's… that's good."

650
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Yeah, third, I'm happy with that,

651
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because there was absolutely
nothing between 'em,

652
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it was like splitting hairs.

653
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Financiers couldn't have gone any better,
so I've had an ace day, just brilliant.

654
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a disaster. [chuckles]

655
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Last place, so tomorrow I need to try
and not let the stress get to my head.

656
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I could very easily go home.

657
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison] <i>Just one challenge remains</i>

658
00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>for our bakers</i>
<i>to secure a place in the final.</i>

659
00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] So, Alison's still not with us.
She's still poorly, unfortunately,

660
00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but a great start to the semi-finals.

661
00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It certainly was.

662
00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dan got a handshake.

663
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think he came back yesterday,
he's been on a bit of a sabbatical.

664
00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And he's popped back
to see what's going on.

665
00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Good time to pop back.
-Yeah, semi-final.

666
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The other three
are right there biting his heels.

667
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I mean, the technical,
we had Josh in first,

668
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the signature, Bakewell tart,

669
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-it was a little artificial.
-Yeah.

670
00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Technical, Matty came second.
-[Paul] He did.

671
00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then the signature bake,
great flavours in both.

672
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
His sponge was a little bit dry,

673
00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then Tash in last place.

674
00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would never have said
Tasha could make such a mess

675
00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of such a simple thing as an apple tart.

676
00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tasha needs to pull it back
in the showstopper.

677
00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very tight this week.

678
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can't call it at the moment,
it is down to this last challenge.

679
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So exciting.

680
00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hello, bakers, welcome back to the tent,
it's time for your showstopper challenge.

681
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Today, the judges would love you
to bake an exquisite millefoglie,

682
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is the Italian equivalent
of the French mille-feuille.

683
00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now I know how to say it in Italian and
French but don't know what it is. Paul?

684
00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a highly decorated pastry

685
00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with buttery flaky layers.

686
00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Amazing. You have four hours.

687
00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On your marks,

688
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
get set, bake.

689
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's do it, everybody.

690
00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] So many elements
have gotta go right today.

691
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pastry's first and foremost.

692
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lamination's holding your nerve,

693
00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
give yourself enough time to do
what you need to do.

694
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] Puff pastry,
if I was doing it at home,

695
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd do this over a couple of days,
I wouldn't be ramming it in to four hours.

696
00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gonna be a manic one.
It's actually my birthday today.

697
00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a memorable one for sure.

698
00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've not had a birthday like it.

699
00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And probably never will again. [chuckles]

700
00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The showstopper challenge
in the semi-final is a millefoglie.

701
00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This traditionally
is an Italian celebration cake.

702
00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These things are highly decorated
and taste incredible.

703
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What we want is at least
four layers of puff pastry,

704
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
real puff pastry, not rough puff
or cheat's puff, proper puff pastry.

705
00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is all about timing.

706
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's about producing those
gorgeous laminations that we want inside.

707
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] I am just rolling out my butter.

708
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once my dough's rested in the fridge,
I'll start doing the laminating.

709
00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The trick is to keep chilling the pastry.

710
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because of course all this rolling
and folding warms the pastry up.

711
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If it gets too warm, the layers disappear.

712
00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm alternating all day
between the fridge and the freezer.

713
00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fingers crossed it'll all be all right.

714
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's difficult.

715
00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Nowhere to hide on this
because all the layers are there stark

716
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and everyone can see it, so any problems,
they will show up straight away.

717
00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This has to be perfection.

718
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Morning, Dan.

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

895
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I've never done pastry

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

905
00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But are you not worried about the idea
of a mirror glaze on top?

906
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the idea of a mirror glaze,

907
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's about the texture.
Sometimes it can be a bit rubbery.

908
00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

910
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the flavours sound great. But for me,
it's about the setting on those things.

911
00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:03.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I imagine he's going to have to put a bit
of gelatine into each of his layers

912
00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the curd won't stand up
to the weight of other layers on top.

913
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's got to keep the level really flat.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which seems a lot, but then again,
I'm making a very large batch of it.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's using all the alcohols you can
think of. It's a dangerous thing to do.

920

921
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

is you should never be able to feel,

you have an hour left.

928
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

929
00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[in normal voice] That was the spirit
of bread.

930
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am so behind.

931
00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pastry needs to bake.
Still got mango curd to make.

932
00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the first time I might not
actually finish a challenge.

933
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything is now in the oven. I need it
to be cool before I assemble anything.

934
00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So much going on. Sorting out my curd,
whipping that cream,

935
00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] I'm making my amaretto mousse.

937
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's a gelatine mix gone in
with the amaretto.

938
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gives it a bit of body and strength

939
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the limoncello diplomat.

941
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit soft,
but I'm hoping should be all right.

942
00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looking very good. I think I might…
I might give it another couple of minutes.

943
00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then it'll be done, but it looks nice.
Nice and golden, and puffy.

944
00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Happy with that.

945
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] These look nice. Happy?

946
00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looking at the colour of Dan and Josh's

947
00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe I'll put 'em back in.
You want 'em to be crisp.

948
00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look how dark theirs are.

949
00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What if Paul goes, "Theirs are too dark"?
You'd be kicking yourself.

950
00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are your baker's instincts
telling you?

951
00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Copy them.

952
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If that's the right colour, you're gonna…

953
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've lost my bottle.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

is I need to make the mango curd.

958
00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

959
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

960
00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like to trim it down 'cause it shows off

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Worst rose ever, but…

1028
00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm all done. I'm really pleased.

1029
00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not dipping, is it?
Just get Paul in now. [chuckles]

1030
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tasha] Yeah, steady hands.
Steady hands. Oh.

1031
00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, bakers, your time is up.

1032
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please step away from your bakes.

1033
00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You did it, babies.
-[exhales]

1034
00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You did it.

1035
00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1036
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, everybody.

1037
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Awesome.

1038
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Josh, that's incredible.

1039
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Yours looks lovely, Matty.

1040
00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] Wish that cream
would set a bit more.

1041
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] <i>It's time to judge</i>
<i>the bakers' millefoglies.</i>

1042
00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Josh, would you like to bring up
your showstopper, please?

1043
00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Josh, it is a thing of beauty.

1044
00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The lamination that you've achieved
is exceptional.

1045
00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It flakes and it's flat.
It's not dipping. I like that.

1046
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Josh] I know, you said.
-[Paul] Let's look inside.

1047
00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Beautiful.

1048
00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[gasps] Oh.
-[Paul] Look at that.

1049
00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want to clap. It's so perfect.

1050
00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Josh laughs]
-[Prue grunts]

1051
00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've done
an amazing job with the pastry.

1052
00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-It literally crumbles in your mouth.

1053
00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, I think
you've slightly overbaked it by minutes.

1054
00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1055
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've been really clever
about the amount of gelatine you've used,

1056
00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it could easily
have been rubbery.

1057
00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could've oozed out with the weight.

1058
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] You've done it beautifully.

1059
00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I very seldom disagree
with Mr Hollywood,

1060
00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I don't think the pastry's overbaked.

1061
00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much.

1062
00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks.
-[Prue] Thank you.

1063
00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

1064
00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, Joshy.

1065
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've had a bit of a squeeze on that.

1066
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the reason is your chocolate
is heavier than your cream.

1067
00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flip it, and it won't happen.

1068
00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As I put it on I thought
I should've put that on the bottom.

1069
00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. Exceptional decoration
on there, though.

1070
00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think it's so imaginative.
And I love the shape

1071
00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And you can see the lamination.
-[Paul] The flake's good.

1072
00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Cream is delicious.

1073
00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The flavours are fantastic.

1074
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is a tiramisu feel to it.

1075
00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The coffee is just the right level.

1076
00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I don't think
the mirror glaze works.

1077
00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks beautiful, but it's very rubbery.

1078
00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, is it? Okay.

1079
00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Dan] Thanks.

1080
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Well done.
-Thanks.

1081
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, mate.

1082
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[softly] Well done.

1083
00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It looks like a celebration.
-Centrepiece, isn't it?

1084
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, but I think you made
a little mistake here.

1085
00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did you use a cake tin to cut the pastry?
-[Matty] Yeah.

1086
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The trouble is that the cake ring
will squash the pastry.

1087
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It squashes and seals.

1088
00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It'll grow. But not at the edges.
-Yeah.

1089
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But you can see that
the pastry is laminated.

1090
00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is splitting into layers.

1091
00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't like your puff pastry.

1092
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's too rubbery.

1093
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] If baked through,
it would be better.

1094
00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:00.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It should be flakier than that.
You've shied off from giving it colour.

1095
00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Now this one is the marsala.
-[Matty] Yeah.

1096
00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Delicious.
-[Paul] I love the flavours.

1097
00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're spot on with that.

1098
00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Puff pastry, I'm not convinced about.

1099
00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Thanks, Matty.
-Thanks.

1100
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done, Matty.
-Thank you.

1101
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Good flavour.
-[Matty] We'll see.

1102
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the pipework.
I like the decoration,

1103
00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it's not particularly square.

1104
00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. I had to rush at the end.
I had some problems.

1105
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You never had a chance to cut it?

1106
00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I was trying to get them cool quickly.

1107
00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I didn't want the fillings to melt.

1108
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:44.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Great lamination through.
It is incredible, flaking beautifully.

1109
00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look inside, shall we?

1110
00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, that really does
look delicious, doesn't it?

1111
00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Hmm.

1112
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] What's this?
-[Tasha] The mango curd.

1113
00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very grainy.

1114
00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no.

1115
00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It tastes lovely, but it's not quite
as silky smooth as the other two.

1116
00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've done well
with your lamination.

1117
00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And your flavours are good.

1118
00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But that mango curd isn't right.

1119
00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done.

1120
00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah…

1121
00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not ideal.

1122
00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm disappointed in myself
because I know I could do better.

1123
00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

1124
00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:34.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But gotta keep your chin up. So…

1125
00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matty] The flavours, they liked.

1126
00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, it's just the pastry.
Not enough colour.

1127
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, and the way that I cut it.

1128
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All makes perfect sense now,
doesn't it? Once you know, you know.

1129
00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That could be the issue.
That could be a problem.

1130
00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1131
00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Well, that was
an interesting showstopper.

1132
00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I enjoyed them.
-Josh's?

1133
00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Epic. His flavours were really good.

1134
00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The look of it was perfect.
And beautifully laminated.

1135
00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So overall, in line for Star Baker.

1136
00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dan has done well too.

1137
00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I loved this, 'cause it was so original.

1138
00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Slight rubbery mirror,
it's so thin.

1139
00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So thin you can't even--

1140
00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was worth it for the effect
of that guitar. It was beautiful.

1141
00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] So I think it is between
Josh and Dan.

1142
00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Tasha, Matty, are in a more

1143
00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-precarious position.
-I agree.

1144
00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But what I like most about Matty's,

1145
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the flavours.
I love the way he made it look.

1146
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had a problem with the puff pastry.
It needed longer in the oven.

1147
00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's look a little bit closer at Tasha's.

1148
00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The lamination is nice.
That flake and crumbliness.

1149
00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The biggest issue was the curd.

1150
00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Didn't have that
satin-y smoothness for sure.

1151
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's very close between 'em.

1152
00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've gotta pick the three best bakers
to go through to the final.

1153
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get a fork. And we'll have a go.
-Yeah.

1154
00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:49.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're going back in?

1155
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are nothing if not devoted to duty.

1156
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

1157
00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've got the tea. Bring on the cakes.

1158
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, well done.

1159
00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was a particularly tough week.

1160
00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Patisserie's not easy.

1161
00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you all did amazingly.

1162
00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There can only be one Star Baker, though,

1163
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and this week's Star Baker is…

1164
00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Josh.

1165
00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[applause]

1166
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighing] Ah, onto the hard bit.

1167
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'd love to take you all through
to the final, but we can't do that.

1168
00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So this is really heartbreaking.

1169
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The person who's leaving us is…

1170
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tasha.

1171
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[softly] Hey, well done. Come here.

1172
00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs heavily] It's okay.

1173
00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Sorry, Tash. You did really well.
Really well.

1174
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1175
00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just emotional.
Just starting to say goodbye to people,

1176
00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that's when it just really hit. Er…

1177
00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales sharply]

1178
00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matty] You've done amazing, Tash.

1179
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tasha] They're amazing people.

1180
00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They really are friends for life.

1181
00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's a really special thing
about <i>Bake Off.</i>

1182
00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is the most supportive
and loving environment.

1183
00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's changed me, realising that I can do

1184
00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so much more than I realised
that I was capable of.

1185
00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

1186
00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it's a special place.

1187
00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sniffles]

1188
00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm very lucky to be part of it.

1189
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Well done, come here.

1190
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] <i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

1191
00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't believe that at all.

1192
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Star Baker semi-final that is,
I think, incredible.

1193
00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Welcome to the final.

1194
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The final, my nan would be so happy.

1195
00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[voice breaking] She'd have
come down next week.

1196
00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, yeah, really chuffed.

1197
00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Paul, come here.
-[Paul] Welcome to the final.

1198
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much.

1199
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, I can't get my smile
off my face kinda. So excited.

1200
00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Walking out next week and all the bakers
are gonna have their families,

1201
00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
my family's gonna be here.

1202
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hopefully make them proud as well really
with what I've done on the quiet. [laughs]

1203
00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:12.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Matty, well done, pal.

1204
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[indistinct chatter]

1205
00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

1206
00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who'd have thought it?

1207
00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My mind is doing backflips.

1208
00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know. I've never told anyone
that I feel like I'm a good baker.

1209
00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I definitely am growing in confidence.

1210
00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just want to give a good account
of myself.

1211
00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't want any catastrophes,

1212
00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then people are looking like,
"How has he got here?"

1213
00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, fair few days of practice
coming up. [chuckles]
