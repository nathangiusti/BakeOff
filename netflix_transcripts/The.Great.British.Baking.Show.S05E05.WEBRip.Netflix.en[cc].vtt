44
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A time when Prue was in short trousers

45
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because they want you to make
a steamed school pudding.

with an accompaniment,

47
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

when I was at school.

55
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all about that little
bit of sweetness,

56
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then the gorgeous texture
of a light sponge.

57
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

We're, this time, asking them to cook
something on top of the cooker.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's extremely difficult to tell whether
the steamed pudding is cooking correctly.

62
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if it's a little bit stodgy,
it's a big no for me.

you don't want them too stodgy.

that's a big mistake.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

but I don't get the Earl Grey.

341
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

357
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You probably mixed it too much and the
gluten's got quite powerful.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

367
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have the texture of a Bakewell Tart
in there, which is very clever.

368
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
six molten chocolate puddings
filled with peanut butter.

410
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have one hour
and at exactly that point,

411
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you have to present
your bakes for judging.

412
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks...
-Get set...

413
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both] Bake.

414
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Melt the chocolate and butter together.
Whisk the eggs,

415
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
egg yolks and sugar together.
Combine the two mixtures.

416
00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've done it once,
but it was such a long time

417
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it was just filled with chocolate

418
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, melt the chocolate
and butter together.

419
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let me show you something, Prue.

420
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what we've got
is a chocolate molten cake,

421
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with a beautiful peanut butter filling

422
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which oozes out when you cut it.

423
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are designed to be hot straight
from the oven.

424
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we're staggering the start
and we'll judge them live.

425
00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You bake these for ten minutes,

426
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
overbake then the whole mixture
will congeal

427
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you won't get that goo
when you cut it.

428
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's gotta run.
-If they underdo it,

429
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the whole thing will just collapse.

430
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know what? I think this is
a really tricky challenge.

431
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I will be astonished
if everybody produces perfection.

432
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is so weird being on my own.

433
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm petrified, I'm absolutely petrified.

434
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all about timing.
You have to serve it on the hour.

435
00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, baker number two,
for your Technical Challenge,

436
00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul would like you to make six molten
chocolate puddings

437
00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
filled with hot peanut butter.

438
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You have one hour.
-On your marks...

439
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get set...
-...bake.

440
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Never made one, so I suppose actually
I've gotta, you know, really think about

441
00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when they go in the oven,
because they have to be, you know,

442
00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
still runny in the middle.

443
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Potentially they can still
carry on cooking... Oh, it's a minefield.

444
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just melting my chocolate
with some butter.

445
00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, at least I'm not on my own
right now, which makes it a bit better.

446
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hi. Does it?

447
00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Does it actually make it better?
-No.

448
00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it doesn't.

449
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just gonna melt some chocolate,
just melt some chocolate.

450
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Baker number three,
for your Technical Challenge,

451
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul would like you to make
six molten chocolate puddings.

452
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've got one hour.
-Bake!

453
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never made them before.
I know what they look like.

454
00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
What do I need?

455
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got the butter and chocolate melting
and then I'm just about to start

456
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
whisking up eggs and sugar.

457
00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] There's no raising agent
in this at all.

458
00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The raising comes from the whisked eggs.

459
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

460
00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, you need lots of air in it.

461
00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't believe I'm doing it by hand.

462
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Baker number four.

463
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks...
-Get set...

464
00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake.

465
00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have absolutely no idea.

466
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going with ribbon stage,

467
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which means there should be little bit
of a trail left behind.

468
00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything you do,
you second guess yourself.

469
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Should I really be doing it that way?

470
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s that word I like, trepidatious?

471
00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Baker number five.
[Noel] You have one hour.

472
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks...
-Get set...

473
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...bake.

474
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah, that’s okay.

475
00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve made this before, similar.
Not peanut butter though.

476
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s okay, got it.

477
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What am I doing?
So, I’ve just whisked the eggs,

478
00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m trying to let the chocolate cool
a little bit more.

479
00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just don’t like the idea of adding
hot chocolate to the cold eggs sugar mix.

480
00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, oh, have I turned my oven on? Yes.

481
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Julia] I need to combine two together.

482
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Doesn’t say anything
about how to combine, what to do.

483
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] How’s it going?
-Yeah, it should be all right.

484
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just need to crack on really.
I don’t know what I’m doing...

485
00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You saying I’m in your way?
What you saying, Liam?

486
00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Liam] I think I’m doing it right
but I’m not entirely sure.

487
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Baker number six,
for your Technical Challenge

488
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul would like you to make
six molten chocolate puddings.

489
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You have one hour.
-Bake!

490
00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve never made a chocolate pudding
in my life. So, brilliant.

491
00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Yan] So I just added
two tablespoons of flour.

492
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t wanna knock out air bubbles
so that’s why I’m folding it gently.

493
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Baker number seven.
On your marks...

494
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get set...
-...bake.

495
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never made them before in me life.

496
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fortunately, in revision last night,

497
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve briefly gone through
molten volcano cakes,

498
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is similar.

499
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m a lot more confident
that I’m letting on.

500
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

501
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It said divide it between moulds.

502
00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sort of starting out putting the sort
of same amount in each,

503
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
cos they will want them identical.

504
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve weighed them out,
dead on 100 grams in each pot.

505
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Filled three quarters of the way up
and they’re gonna rise.

506
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t want them billowing over the top.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Baker number eight.
On your marks...

509
00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not a clue.

510
00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Julia] I’m just putting my peanut butter
inside of them.

511
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, it says teaspoon,
but with a bit of an extra.

512
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I’m having a terrible dilemma
at the moment.

514
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My main problem is I’m not sure whether
I’m supposed to whisk that up to a frenzy

515
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or not whisk it up a lot. But my heart
is telling me to really go for it.

516
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But then again, my brain is telling me
maybe don’t go for it.

517
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it’s a light folding.

518
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fingers crossed this is the
right way to do it.

519
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Yan] The plan is to chill it
in the freezer for 15 minutes.

520
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you cook it,
it makes it molten in the middle.

521
00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Got probably about ten minutes
in the freezer just to chill them down,

522
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then it’s item six, bake.

523
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Baking time, that’s what it’s all down to
and I have no idea...

524
00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How long?
-...how long to do it for?

525
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, I've got an inkling.
-An inkling?

526
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Got an inkling
and I think it's not very long.

[Sandi] <i>The undisclosed bake time</i>

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ve got 20 minutes left.

529
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m going to bake them for I’m not sure...
[whispers] Twelve minutes.

530
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don’t want them overbaked,
so I’ll probably give them like 20...

531
00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fifteen minutes... Oh, I don’t know.

532
00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No idea. No idea.

533
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eight minutes.

534
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m gonna say it’s probably
about 35 minutes.

535
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, obviously I don’t
want them to be raw.

536
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you’re kidding me.

537
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oven wasn’t on. Come on.

538
00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Eight more minutes, 15 left,
eight more minutes

539
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Twenty-five minutes.

540
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They’re going in now.
They can heat up with the oven.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[James] The key thing with baking
is that you want the outside crispy

542
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it holds the gooey centre.

543
00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Yan] One hundred eighty for ten minutes.

544
00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I[James] f you go too far you’ll just get
a rock hard sponge,

545
00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
too little it’s just gonna splodge,

546
00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so you just need the right balance
because it can be tricky.

547
00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

549
00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Prue] Oh, it's good.

562
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it’s soft still, pouring out.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could’ve done with a touch more filling,
but I must say, it’s not bad.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

butter in it would’ve been better.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

692
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

834
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

837
00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:08.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

848
00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

has been a mess.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

a trifle without custard powder.

865
00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

867
00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, not really. You know, any future
husband better not be getting ideas

868

this is the best way for you to pull.

878
00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

884
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s mango, lime and chilli in there
and then I’m going to be putting cream in.

885
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

886
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The red sponge, cos obviously we want it
to match the colour of the flag.

887
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

888
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

889
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

890
00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

893
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

894
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The terrine’s in the freezer,

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The jelly’s set.

929
00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not great. It hasn’t quite frozen solid.

930
00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fifteen minutes left.
Fifteen minutes only.

931
00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Make or break.

932
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's my girl.

933
00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m trying to get it as smooth
as possible.

934
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s dribbling. It’s dribbling.
It’s dribbling loads. Just look, look.

935
00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s an absolute mess.

936
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stop panicking.
-It’s dribbling and it’s a mess.

937
00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really need them to speed up.
I’m stressing out.

938
00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s not gonna set.

939
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Someone tell me it’s gonna be fine.

940
00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is dripping, it’s dripping.

941
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s fine. It’s all fine. It’s all fine.

942
00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ugh.

943
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have one minute left.

944
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ta-dah! Oh!

945
00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, that is the end of your
Showstopper Challenge.

946
00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Done.

947
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you okay? Are you alright there?

948
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s my orange terrine.

949
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

950
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sophie, please bring up your
ornamental trifle terrine.

951
00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s wonderful that you’ve got your
pink sausage in the middle.

952
00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

953
00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the look of it. I love the colours.

954
00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, drops really lovely.

955
00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Well, that worked.

956
00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beautiful.

957
00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The slice is pretty, a very good slice.

958
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that yuzu really comes through.

959
00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s absolutely delicious.

960
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Brilliant.
-[Prue] Really good.

961
00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sponge, the bavarois,
the mousse, the jelly.

962
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think altogether you created something
very pretty, very high class.

963
00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Terribly delicious.

964
00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Amazing, isn’t it?

965
00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I actually love it. And she’s got
the gelatine to create the poppy.

966
00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s very clever.

967
00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The strawberry mousse is a triumph.
But who doesn’t like strawberry mousse?

968
00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The custard. I think you’ve got
a little bit too much gelatine in there.

969
00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s just set on the wrong side of firm
but it looks incredible.

970
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

971
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Well, it’s certainly jolly.

972
00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pink is proper pink, isn’t it?

973
00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

974
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Well, the slice is pretty,
isn’t it?

975
00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah.

976
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is spot on.

977
00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The lime, the mint, the chilli.

978
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who would have a chilli in a trifle?

979
00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it works, that little heat at the end
is fascinating.

980
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The biscuit down the bottom is delicious,

981
00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
meringues around the outside,
again, genius.

982
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you’ve come up with something
that’s truly unique and tastes beautiful.

983
00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s neat, it’s clean,
there’s stark lines.

984
00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The difference in colour is phenomenal.

985
00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The jelly is very nice and tart
and really raspberry.

986
00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s delicious. The custard takes
me back a few years.

987
00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I used a bit of custard powder.

988
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Me Nan used to do something
very similar to that.

989
00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s very good.

990
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Does look a bit firm.

991
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s too firm on all of it.

992
00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
White chocolate is very sweet.

993
00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The best bit is the prosecco jelly
on the top.

994
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the other layers
are not carrying much flavour.

995
00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s a bit sickly.

996
00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overall, I think the appearance
is all right actually.

997
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m fascinated to see
what it’s like inside.

998
00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t think the jelly works,
funnily enough,

999
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
although I love passion fruit.

1000
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It almost tastes watery.

1001
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The passion fruit isn’t
strong enough for me.

1002
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The texture and everything is okay.

1003
00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That soggy sponge though I just don’t get.

1004
00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s a shame.

1005
00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, look at that.

1006
00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1007
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Wow!

1008
00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Isn’t that fantastic?

1009
00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s very clever.

1010
00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The stars are amazing.

1011
00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Hmm.

1012
00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The coconut flavour’s lovely.

1013
00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s a little tough.

1014
00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm, disappointing.

1015
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t like rubber

1016
00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it is,
it’s too much gelatine in there.

1017
00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you’ve gone for appearance
rather than textures.

1018
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not good.

1019
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a shame, cos it looks amazing.

1020
00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone’s had a style over substance
at least once.

1021
00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it’s a bit clumsy
and the jelly’s not set..

1022
00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I... Yeah.

1023
00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Wow! It’s like water
that jelly, innit?

1024
00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s just...

1025
00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do get the chai.

1026
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chai latte, panna cotta is delicious.

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Chocolate brownie is quite tough
and your jelly is a disaster.

I’d like to stay in but I think
I’m in the danger zone,

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

quite worried, I think, tonight.

but I really don’t think so.

[sighs]

1035
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, who’s vying for the top place?

1036
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought Sophie’s was delicious.

1037
00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you walked into a Michelin starred
restaurant and had that,

1038
00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you wouldn’t argue it.

1039
00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s absolutely superb.

1040
00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] What about Stacey?
[Paul] Very clever.

1041
00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:35.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Every layer was good.
She’s definitely a contender.

1042
00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about Kate, has she saved herself?

1043
00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think she has saved herself. It’s not
the first time that Kate’s done that.

1044
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The whole thing together as one
when you eat it is absolutely delicious

1045
00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and actually quite elegant too.

1046
00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The one who I wanted to weep for
is Liam.

1047
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s all too clumsy.
I sort of weep for him as well.

1048
00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He can do better than that.
He knows that as well.

1049
00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The other one
who I think is in trouble is James.

1050
00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fantastic jelly, problem for me
is every other element was wrong.

1051
00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Julia’s was really disappointing.

1052
00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She had a passion fruit jelly
with very little flavour.

1053
00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Julia, yeah she’s, erm,
put herself into a bit of trouble.

1054
00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, you’ve got a lot to decide.

1055
00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Meanwhile, we’ll just
double-check that this is a...

1056
00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-You know...

1057
00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, bakers,
I get the best job of the week

1058
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
cos I get to announce the Star Baker.

1059
00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Star Baker this week is the baker
whose terrine

1060
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the four of us have literally just
finished off cos it was so delicious.

1061
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The Star Baker is Sophie.

1062
00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all clapping]

1063
00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which means that I’ve got the horrible job
of revealing who’s leaving us.

1064
00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The person that
we have to say goodbye to is...

1065
00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
James.

1066
00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry, mate.

1067
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:09.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry.

1068
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's all right.

1069
00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1070
00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks, Paul.

1071
00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I’m all for you, buddy.
-Yeah.

1072
00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My time has come.

1073
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s gutting.

1074

1075
00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to see how good I was.

1076
00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To be part of that’s been
really humbling.

Don’t get me going. I’m not crying.

1080
00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that’s typical of James.
He’s just such a nice guy.

1081
00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Sophie stepped up to the plate
and produced one of those bakes

1084
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Yes, Star Baker.
I will try and enjoy the moment

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
before I start thinking about next week.
But, yeah, I’m really chuffed.

It was really important that
I did well yesterday, cos if I didn’t...
