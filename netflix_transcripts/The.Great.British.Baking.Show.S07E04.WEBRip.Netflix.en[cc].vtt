as I expected it to be.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] All the elements
are equally important,

455
00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

456
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

460
00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

461
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Today,
for your Technical Challenge,

462
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Henry VIII liked it so much,

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he is said to have kept it

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They must have a flaky
rough-puff pastry case,

467
00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
one layer of lemon curd,

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Henry] I haven't made lemon curd before.

481
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Haven't made a rough puff before.

482
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

485
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's the rough-puff pastry,
and lemon curd in the bottom,

486
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then a curd cheese.

487
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then they have to make a stencil
to get a perfect Tudor rose.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but also the pastry, which can be tricky.

490
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

493
00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll just add a bit more flour.
That's what I need to do.

549
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

551
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michelle] I've forgotten
how to make curd.

552
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you make it in the pan,
put the eggs in as well?

553
00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Phil] Yeah.

554
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] I do like lemon curd.

555
00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But when you realise it's just eggs,
butter and sugar, basically...

556
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It sort of demystifies it.

557
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like when I knew what ganache was.

559
00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Someone went,
"It's just chocolate and cream."

560
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yeah.

561
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rosie] I'm trying to decide
when to stop doing the curd.

562
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it thickens more as it cools down.

563
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's just the lemon curd.

564
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll leave that now
and let it do its thing.

565

570
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know whether
it will get any thicker if it cools,

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Priya] They are deep-fried and soaked

1110
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1138
00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I felt proud that I'd recreated something
that I really like.

1139
00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's okay.
-[Phil] Yeah.

1140
00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Phil] <i>Not so hot today,</i>

1141
00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It's like a rollercoaster, you know?</i>

1142
00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're on top of the coaster
and then all of a sudden, you drop down.

1143
00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you think, "Oh."

1144
00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] I loved this Showstopper.

1145
00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was amazed at the different flavours

1146
00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the enthusiasm and the variety
and the colours.

1147
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] This looks fab.
-[Prue] It's exquisite.

1148
00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Star Baker potentials?

1149
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think Steph did well.
-[Sandi] Hmm.

1150
00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think David's done well.

1151
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have our Star Baker in one of those.

1152
00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:35.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Henry could not get Star Baker.
I mean, he just did three round balls,

1153
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which was, you know, we're always after...

1154
00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Like a mutant.
-[laughing]

1155
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But let's not dwell on Henry's balls.

1156
00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's have a look at
who's suddenly in trouble.

1157
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Michael, Priya...

1158
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Phil.
-Er, I think Phil's dropped.

1159
00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:55.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Really disappointing. Very simple stuff.
-Yeah.

1160
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That was, erm,
almost kindergarten playdough.

1161
00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Oh, okay.

1162
00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could be the week for two people?

1163
00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It very much could be, yeah.
It's very, very close.

1164
00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1165
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, bakers, I now have the pleasure
of telling you who is Star Baker.

1166
00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, the person who is Star Baker
this week,

1167
00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
er, was very close last week
to achieving the title,

1168
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but this week has absolutely nailed it.

1169
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Our Star Baker is Steph.

1170
00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all cheering and clapping]

1171
00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Phil] Well done.

1172
00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fantastic.

1173
00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

1174
00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That means I've got the horrible job
of announcing

1175
00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the baker who's leaving us this week.

1176
00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The person who's leaving us
this week is...

1177
00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Phil.

1178
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Sorry, Phil.

1179
00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Michelle] What the hell is that?
-Don't know.

1180
00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:08.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Phil, pal.

1181
00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michelle] What the heck is that?
Oh, my God.

1182
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Dairy week.

1183
00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Curse the dairy week.

1184
00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Still, I had a good run.
Such an amazing group of people.

1185
00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fantastic.

1186
00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely loved every second of it.

1187
00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What are you playing at?
-[laughing]

1188
00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's his fault, you know that?
-[Phil] What are you playing at?

1189
00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Phil was particularly shocked.

1190
00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And he had justification to be shocked

1191
00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it was that tight,
it was that close.

1192
00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>It was a little bit boring,</i>
<i>a little bit too simple.</i>

1193
00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>He struggled in the Showstopper,</i>

1194
00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is why, sadly, Phil had to leave.

1195
00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[all laughing] Oh, Phil.
-[Priya] Get in.

1196
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm through. Oh, God, what a weekend.

1197
00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It's a massive relief.</i>

1198
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I think, "Am I gonna be feeling like</i>
<i>I'm gonna be going home every week</i>

1199
00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>for every week that I stay in?"</i>

1200
00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this just how it it?

1201
00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michael] <i>I knew that Priya and I</i>

1202
00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel a bit guilty, perhaps,
for even being here next week...

1203
00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...but mainly thrilled for Steph.

1205
00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because, wow.

1206
00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was so pleased for Steph.
She's a very serious baker.

1207
00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1208
00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, okay, so, erm, I just got Star Baker.

1209
