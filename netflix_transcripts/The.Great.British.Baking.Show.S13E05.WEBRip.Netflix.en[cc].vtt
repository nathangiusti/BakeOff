Tempering is basically melting chocolate,
cooling it, and then warming it slightly.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

will be very shiny.

and come away from the mould more easily.

58
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A mousse is quite light
and melts in the mouth.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

They're so neat. Very Tom.

415
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-[Prue] Very clever.

416
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Wow!
-[Prue] What about them?

417
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've got a coffee-soaked biscotti
at the bottom, dark chocolate mousse,

418
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then we've got a white chocolate
marsala mousse on the top.

419
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then that's all set
in a white chocolate

420
00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with a touch of dark chocolate cup.

421
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's beautifully thin, Tom,
and I love the mousse.

422
00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that's the perfect texture.

423
00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that's great to hear.

424
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What it is is it's a balance
of the sweet and the bitter.

425
00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even that chocolate
brings something to it as well.

426
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the whole thing together,
it is exceptional.

427
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done. Yeah.
-Stop it!

428
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I absolutely agree.
That's what it deserves.

429
00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow!

430
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That could be for sale in
a patisserie shop in the middle of Paris.

431
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, stop it!
-Probably do extremely well.

432
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you so much, guys.

433
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Wow.

434
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you so much.

435
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wow, well done.
-[Tom] Wow.

436
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks incredible.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-He's in shock. [laughs]

438
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You cannot ask for better feedback.
I mean, I'm chuffed.

439
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That biscotti is beautiful.

440
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Aaron] I did actually taste Tom's,

441
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the texture on the mousse
was absolutely perfect.

442
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

443
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Nadia] It wasn't the best, so if I can do
a little bit better on my next two bakes,

444
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then I'll be happy.

445
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I can't believe that.

446
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought that was gonna be
absolutely horrendous.

447
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it was great.

448
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

white chocolate and berries.

a layer of lemon curd

491
00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with a little bit of thyme
to add another level.

492
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I took passion fruit, lemon,
limes, pistachio, blueberries.

493
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Aaron] If you do too much,
it's gonna bite you in the proverbial.

494
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were cautious in the presence
of [dramatically] the gingham pantry!

495
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, this is the first time

496
00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we've let the bakers
finish a Technical as they like.

497
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] What we've asked them for
is a shortcrust base

498
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with a set white chocolate ganache
topped with whatever they want

499
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to go with the silky smooth sweetness
from the white chocolate.

500
00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I suppose there might be a temptation
to overcomplicate things.

501
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You want to celebrate the white chocolate.

502
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've chosen a sort of slightly tart
passion fruit and mango.

503
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, for the shortcrust base,
we haven't given them the recipe.

504
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For goodness sake,
they know how to make shortcrust pastry.

505
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] They should do.

506
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think where they could go wrong
is making it very thick and too robust.

507
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But they make it too thin,
and it can crack easily.

508
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mm. It's quite refreshing
with the passion fruit and mango.

509
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] But you can taste the chocolate.

510
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's something you could finish.

511
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Easily. I'm trying not to,

512
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because we have got eight more
to deal with.

513
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sorry. I've got to have another piece.

514
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. I've made pastry
so many times before. I can do this.

515
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tom] I have no recipe
for shortcrust pastry.

516
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

517
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whatever. Sue me.

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
our bakers have to produce
a chocolate fondue design, really.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

at least two treats to dip into it.

a major baked element in this as well.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

some catastrophic failures.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

We're staying positive today.
