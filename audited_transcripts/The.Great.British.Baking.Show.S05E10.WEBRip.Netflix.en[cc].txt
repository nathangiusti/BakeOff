-Hello, Sophie.
-Hi.
-Hello, Sophie.
-How you doing? Hello.
[Paul] I think they look very good.
I do like the plait, it's a little bit
under proved, but not much.
The naan bread looks interesting.
I wouldn't call that a ciabatta really.
[Prue] Well, let's see how it tastes.
I mean, I must say that
I'm impressed by the look of them,
especially the spelt ones.
I think, it looks really good.
[Sandi] Sounds good.
[Paul] It is slightly under proved,
and therefore, what follows
is it's slightly under baked.
[Prue] I'll tell you what,
the flavour is lovely.
-Mmm. Great flavour.
-Really nice flavour.
[Prue] I think spelt bread
is not the tastiest.
[Sandi] Good start.
[Paul] Let's look at this ciabatta,
shall we?
[Paul] I always cut ciabatta's this way
'cause you get more
of an indication of the overall structure.
A pretty nice structure,
but not as open as it could be.
Smells really mushroomy.
They were dried mushrooms, weren't they?
Erm, some dried, some sautéed.
[Paul] It works. It brings you
two different textures then.
And they do taste very, very good.
I wouldn't call it a ciabatta though.
Right, let's have a look at this.
Great structure.
Great, look at that.
[Prue] And you know
the orange really works,
I didn't think it would.
[Paul] Excellent flavour. Soft crumb.
Great texture on the outside,
and the plaiting's very good as well.
-Thank you very much indeed.
-Thank you.

*Steven*
Hmm, they definitely do look
a little different, don't they?
And that one does not look
much like that one.
They do look pretty terrible,
but look at the consistency,
they do look awful.
[Steven] So the bread
has the garlic running through it
and then there's some cheese
and rosemary in the centre.
[Prue] Smells good.
It's actually a little disappointing
'cause it's quite tough.
-Your dough needed more water.
-Okay.
[Paul] Dry dough
will split wherever it wants to go,
and that's what's caused that,
-and that to all be totally different.
-Yeah.
-[Paul] These don't look good either.
It's massively under proved.
Rye bread tends to rip
because that one there...
[Prue] Yeah. I agree
with those he's trying to put away.
[Paul] It instantly means
that you've under proved it.
-Yeah.
-[Paul] But let's have a taste.
It's probably gonna
be slightly doughy inside.
And it tastes like gluey in your...
[Steven] Mmm.
...in your mouth. Nice flavour though.
[Paul] Beautiful flavour.
Just right the rye and the spelt.
[Paul] The Winston knots...
[Prue] They are so artisanal
and real and beautiful.
It's always tricky
when you put something into the middle.
Does it destroy the crumb?
I think you've done quite well
on the sweet one there.
That is very good.
[Prue] It's delicious.
I think the chocolate's really good,
and you've got just enough cinnamon,
it's not overpowering.
Under proved, under proved, perfect.
-Thank you very much, Steven.
-Thank you.
[Prue] Thank you.
[Paul] Thank you.

*Kate*
I must say, I think these are interesting
and they look absolutely beautiful.
-Now this is the spelt?
-Yeah.
[Paul] It's got a little rip
but a nice neat pattern.
I'm not gonna fault the actual flavour,
except that I think
if you'd had a little salt in there,
you'd have enhanced it.
Erm, I quite like it.
You push it, it springs back,
which is a good sign.
Let's have a look at these.
Nice. That's the sound I like to hear.
Great structure.
You can tell, you see
where the knife drags the dough?
It doesn't cut through
like a cake, it's pulling.
So you have this tension there.
I think the texture's perfect.
Nice and crisp on the outside.
I'm getting a little bit of flavour
in there as well, which is good.
-Okay.
-[Sandi] That's a good one.
-Oh, right.
-[Prue] Right.
Now, let's look at these ones.
-It's a filled one, isn't it?
-[Kate] Yeah.
[Prue] I see.
[Kate] Oh, no.
[Sandi] You all right?
What's he thinking? [laughs]
[Sandi] You can never tell.
I'll tell you what I think.
I think it's got a lovely texture.
I think it's properly baked,
I like the curry,
and I like the flaky edge.
It tastes divine.
The structure's spot on,
I like the filling.
-Something I might even look at.
-[chuckles]
I think overall you've done very well.
-[Prue] Well done, Kate.
-Thanks.

Sophie, please bring up
your final Showstopper.
Thank you, Sophie. Can you tell us
all about your entremet please?
So I've named my entremet,
"Ode to the Honey Bee."
There's an orange blossom financier sponge
and there is a blackberry jelly.
Then there is a feuilletine
caramelised honey custard,
a set lemon curd, a white chocolate
and lavender mousse, and a mirror-glaze.
[Prue] I think the overall look
is absolutely beautiful.
It's original, it's pretty,
the marbling is absolutely stunning.
[Paul]
The collar's broken up a little bit,
but the honeycomb with the bee,
with the flower, with the marble,
-I think is exceptional.
-Thank you.
[Paul] Wow, the knife just fell through.
[Prue] That's great.
Look at that.
That is just set,
and they're not running
into each other, the layers?
Very neat, the jelly especially.
[Prue] And it's just holding together.
That is amazing.
Mmm, lemon and lavender,
has got to be the new taste.
[chuckles]
[sighs]
I love it.
Being the theme
of the entremet is the honey,
that's the first thing you get,
and it's not overly sweet.
The jelly with that little tartness,
the sponge is just right
'cause it gives it that little bit
of bite to the whole thing.
And even the lemon
and the lavender work as well.
Every one of the creamy, jelly layers
is the right degree of gelatine.
It's not rubbery, it's not liquid,
and on top of all that,
it tastes fantastic.
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you.
[Sophie] Thank you so much.
[exhales]
Kate, would you like to bring
your entremet up to the table, please?
[Prue chuckles] Oh, flew off.
Kate, remind us about your entremet.
It's yuzu and white chocolate bavarois
on top of coconut dacquoise
with lychee jelly and yuzu zest sponge,
and then a yuzu and white chocolate glaze.
It's tremendously unusual
and beautifully done.
The glaze is as shiny as a bathroom tile.
The mirror-finish
you got on the top is beautiful,
and the colour choices are superb.
Well, that dropped really well, actually.
[Prue] Oh, look at that. Wow. Wow.
[Paul] They're big,
and they're bold, and they're equal.
I think that yuzu flavour is just
so sharp and delicious, and surprising.
It starts of tasting like grapefruit,
and then you know it's not grapefruit.
Mmm, it's lovely.
I love the flavour combinations.
The bavarois, it's that light citrus.
And have you put that
in the jelly as well?
Because it's got this beautiful citrus
hit as well in there.
That meringue and coconut
is a little stroke of genius
because it's a different flavour.
It's very harmonious
with the lemony flavours
and it's drier than the bavarois,
so you get the contrast of texture
and the contrast of flavour
-and I think it's really beautiful.
-Okay.
The jelly melts in the mouth,
not too much gelatine in there.
The sponge and then
that light bavarois is sublime.
I'd eat that all day.
-Thank you.
-[Sandi] Well done.
[Kate] Thank you.
-Well done, Kate.
-This could make you win.
Good luck, Steve.
Thank you.
Steven, please bring up
your final Showstopper.
Steven, tell us all about
your entremet, please.
So insider there is a hazelnut dacquoise,
Genoise sponge with a raspberry coulis.
There is bananas and custard
surrounded by chocolate mousse.
On the yin side
is white chocolate flocking,
and on the yang side, galaxy mirror glaze.
That is extraordinary glazing.
It looks like a shell, it's amazing.
The contrast is there,
but I almost want this to be smoother
and a little bit more refined.
This looks a little as if it's unfinished.
I'm gonna go for the mirror.
The distinctive layers
upsets me a little bit.
Because this all comes down to timing,
-which I've said before.
-Yeah.
The mirror glaze is not quite set,
and so the knife is taking the colour
through to the next layer,
and the next layer's
been pushed through to the next layer.
Love the bananas,
love the chocolate mousse.
If I was to close my eyes and eat that,
that's a chocolate mousse
with a bit of banana in.
You're not getting
too many textures in there.
I want to cut a bit of the other side
because that blue glaze
is making a muddle.
To me, it's exactly the same.
You've got bleeding of each of the layers.
It's hard to distinguish any layers
except the dominant ones,
the chocolate and the banana.
It's almost too much of a good thing.
It's very rich and sweet.
I don't think you'd be
able to eat a lot of it.
I just think you missed the trick here.
-Mmm.
-I think you missed a trick.
-Thank you very much.
-[Steven] Thank you.
