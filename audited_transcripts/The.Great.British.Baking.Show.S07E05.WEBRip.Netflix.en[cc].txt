*David*
It looks like a custard pie
you'd see in a French patisserie shop.
[Noel] Yeah.
Very professional,
very neat on the outside.
It is absolutely exquisite.
You've managed to make these
flapper girls look quite flirty. [laughs]
[Paul] The base
to the amount of custard, perfect.
Beautifully cooked.
[Prue] Just cooked.
That's a custard pie.
It's silky-smooth. Delicious.
Yes.
Yeah!
[all applauding]
It's a perfect custard pie.
The base, crumbly, crispy.
The custard baked to perfection.
Beautifully level, filled to the top.
And then the design, impeccable.
Wonderful, David.
Thank you.

*Michael*
I like the decoration.
I think the decoration is very good.
It's not full enough.
You could've had more filling in there.
[Prue] That custard texture looks perfect.
[Paul] It looks lovely and silky.
The balance with the ginger is perfect.
It's baked beautifully.
If you'd had more custard in there,
and a little bit neater on the top,
you're looking at perfection.
-It's a beautiful pie.
-Wow.
-Well done. Thank you.
-[Michael] Thank you.

*Priya*
[Paul] Oh, dear.
What happened with the decoration?
Well, surprise, surprise,
I ran out of time.
[Prue] You could have had
a little more custard in there.
[Priya] Yes.
[Paul] You've boiled it, basically.
And so what's happened is it's bubbled up.
And as you brought it out...
-You bring it out, and then it sinks.
-[Priya] Yeah.
It tastes amazing.
Problem is, you boiled your custard,
and your pastry's too thick.
-Yeah.
-[Paul] Far too thick.

*Alice*
-Is there booze in there?
-[Alice] No.
Erm, so, orange juice, orange zest,
and a bit of orange extract as well.
Celebrate the orange with the zest,
not with an extract.
For me, the flavour has been overwhelmed
by that extract.
Okay.

*Steph*
The decoration, it's simplistic
but quite effective.
-The colour of it looks good.
-[Steph] Okay.
[Paul] It looks like the perfect colour.
It's golden.
[Prue] And I think the custard looks
beautifully set.
[Paul] The flavour's beautiful.
The pastry is fantastic as well,
'cause it's flaky.
It's delicious because
you've got lots and lots of citrus.
Okay.

*Michelle*
Are you getting the blueberry?
I've just had a mouthful of blueberry
and didn't get anything.
I don't think blueberries have much taste.
-[Paul] It's a shame.
-Okay.
The sugar top hasn't quite worked
like a crème brûlée.
But nice idea,
and they do look very neat though.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

*Henry*
-[Paul] Erm, they look quite neat.
-[Henry] Mm-hmm.
It's very thick, that base.
Yeah, there's more base
than there is filling.
Yeah.
[Paul] Your flavour of the custard's good.
There's a lovely zing of...
-Of zest.
-The flavour's okay?
It's good. It's overbaked
because there's so little of it.

*Helena*
This is Helena all over, isn't it?
[laughs] It's amazing.
[Paul] I think the design is incredible.
[Noel] What a colour.
It's got lavender, so I thought
I could get away with purple.
-That is so much. Too much lavender.
-[Helena] Oh, really?
-It's a little bit soapy.
-Okay.
It's not bad.
It's not brilliant, but it's not bad.
Well, I'll take that, Paul.

*Rosie*
I did have an accident.
-[Paul] You've lost one of them.
-Yeah.
-It's down there. You can...
-[all chuckling]
[Noel] These are incredible.
Yeah, they're absolutely exquisite,
the jelly that you've injected.
Was the plan that these
would have looked like that on top?
[Rosie] Yeah, they were on top.
And they melted. [chuckles]
[Paul] It looks a bit sad on the top
'cause it's not finished.
Pastry's quite damp. It isn't crisp.
The matcha sort of does come through.
It's not one of my favourite flavours,
matcha, but, erm...
Fair enough.
[Paul] I love the blackberry.
I love that flavour.
Flavour of the custard is delicious.
Thank you.

*Michael*
I must say, Michael, it's really neat.
It's original. Nicely done.
And it's stark because
you've got the blackberries
with the black icing. It's really unusual.
Your piping's really good.
It's pretty accurate.
[exhales sharply]
I know you had this idea that
you'd have the drizzle running down
-like you do in the drink.
-Yeah.
It sort of hasn't worked.
It looks like a smudge.
I like the lemon. The sponge is good.
But I'd have loved to have
that fruit coming through,
that sharpness coming through.
You may have got the colour,
but you certainly haven't got the flavour.
-Okay.
-Nice cake, though.
Thank you.

*Helena*
You know, it's such a mixture
-of sinister and very pretty.
-[laughing]
That's me. [laughing]
I don't like the outside of it,
and I tell you why.
-Why?
-The piping work is not good.
Okay, let's have a look inside.
-That's a red cake.
-[laughs] It is.
-It's a bit bland inside.
-Bland?
-Yeah. It's quite dry.
-[Prue] You get the vodka.
You don't get much raspberry.
But I find it a pleasant cake.
If you shut your eyes,
it's a nice sponge cake.
Thanks, Prue. [chuckles]

*Henry*
-It's quite an elegant-looking cake.
-It looks really dramatic.
And very '20s. I like that.
Lovely flavour. Really good flavour.
-I think it's a little dry.
-[Henry] Mm-hmm.
-Yes, it's a bit dry.
-Okay.
But the design, structure,
and flavour is very good.
Thank you.

*Rosie*
That's one of the most interesting
looking cakes I've seen for a long time.
That took a bit of getting through.
It's the ganache. I wanted it really firm
so I could crumb coat it.
Wow. Wow.
That's not a ganache,
that's a bar of chocolate.
I can certainly taste the alcohol.
I like the sponge inside.
The flavours are beautiful.
My biggest complaint is the thickness
of the outside of the cake.
-Okay.
-I think it's a really good cake,
but you know it's not perfect.

*David*
I like the sort of naked cake look.
Are they meant to be
dropped into each other?
-No.
-[Prue laughs]
-Could have got away with that, David.
-I know. Definitely weren't.
Mmm, it's fine. Nice and lemony.
-Good strong flavour.
-The buttercream's quite grainy.
And I don't like that in a buttercream.
It should be absolutely silky-smooth.
But the sponge is baked well
and I like the lemon.

*Alice*
Close up, it does look a bit of a mess.
I think the drawing on here is not good.
It could be a lot neater than that.
There's some really big
pieces of pineapple in here.
The flavour's nice, I just think
the pieces are a little bit clumsy.
It's a really good cake.
It could be fantastic.

*Priya*
I think the decoration has been rushed.
It needs to be much more vibrant.
Yeah.
It's quite a delicate flavour. Very nice.
I'd like perhaps
a little more passion fruit.
-Overall, the cake's nice.
-Yeah.
But your fondant on the outside's
a bit too thick.
Yeah.

*Steph*
If you're thinking of piña colada
as a cake, I think you've got one.
-Okay.
-And it tells you what's in there.
-Yeah.
-Piña colada.
-Let's see how it tastes.
-Hmm.
Wow. That just dropped through.
-Is that good or bad?
-[whispers] I don't know.
That looks really appetising.
I like the different colours.
-I love the lime sponges.
-They're delicious.
I've never had anything like it.
That's a first for me.
-And it works.
-It's really good.
Clever.
Thank you, Steph.

*Michelle*
Michelle, I think this...
decoration, the way you've tackled it,
is really interesting,
and it's actually quite pretty.
But I think you've overthought it.
There are too many concepts.
That doesn't go with that,
-and that doesn't go with that.
-Let's have a look inside.
The sponges are nice and equal.
-They look a nice texture.
-Yeah.
You've got shavings and flakiness
of coconut in there,
-which don't work in a cake.
-Okay.
And I think that cake's slightly too dry.
You're getting a lack of flavour.
A smaller cake with
more of the pineapple in,
with none of the coconut.
You'd end up with a cake
that's slightly shorter
but full of flavour all the way through.



Let's go through the top of the pack,
the ones that you really liked.
-Steph is looking good.
-Steph's looking good.
[Prue] Steph has been
a very consistent baker.
-She had a good week.
-The lime knocked you out.
Yeah. Henry...
-Henry did a decent job.
-His flavours were really good.
[Paul] I liked--
It was quite an elegant cake.
Henry normally misses that slightly.
-David's you liked?
-It was a great decoration.
Very well thought through, very artistic.
And he did back that style up
-with a little bit of substance.
-Yeah.
Who might we be saying goodbye to?
-Wow. There's quite a lot to be honest.
-There's an awful lot.
I think you're looking at Michelle,
Helena, Priya, Rosie.
But on this point, I think, when you
look over the three challenges closely,
I think there are two people
that are beginning to fall away.
Okay.
Well done, bakers, for getting
through the Roaring Twenties.
Now, fortunately,
I've got the wonderful job
of announcing the person
who's won Star Baker.
The person who's won
Star Baker this week is...
Steph.
[applauding]
Again!
So, that means I have the horrible job
of sending home, I'm afraid,
-two of you this week.
-Okay.
And the two people
who are going home are...
-Michelle and Helena. I'm so sorry.
-Oh, Helena.
Oh.
-Oh.
-Well, at least we go together.
-I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
-It's all right.
No surprise, was it? To be fair.
Oh, darling.
I'm so happy getting to week five.
I never thought I'd get here,
so to be here, to get Star Baker,
and to leave on week five, perfect.
I'm bringing the geode cake to Extra Slice
'cause I love it.
I love the fault line.
I've loved it. It's been fun.
It's been emotional. It's been emotional.
I have enjoyed it and I've made
some really good friends.
Friends for life, yes.
-What? What's happening here?
-I'm sorry we got rid of your sister.
Family. Brutal.
I'm actually okay about it.
I've had an amazing time.
I've learned that I can take criticism,
I can have a laugh with it.
And take the positives out of everything,
which hopefully I'll carry on doing.
I definitely feel like I've dodged
the biggest bullet in the world.
Cat with nine lives.
[Priya] I was ready to, like,
hold hands together and skip out.
I thought I was going.
I'd accepted it, I'd moved on,
I'd come to terms with it
and now it's like, what?
I don't understand.
Prue came and told me it was really close,
I did nearly go.
[inhales sharply] Yeah.
[giggles]
You legend, twice in a row. Wow.
Steph has been Star Baker
two weeks running.
-Erm, she doesn't know how good she is.
-Wow.
I literally feel like the person that's
always been middle-of-the-road,
erm... and it just all feels a bit weird.
Ah! I'm just so speechless.
I'm like, "What?"
Er, I just, I'm-- Yeah, lost for words.
