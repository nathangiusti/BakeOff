*Ruby*
-Hello, Ruby.
-Hello.
It's really cylindrical.
The shape of it's even all the way down.
-[Prue] Pray.
-Oh, I'm praying.
[Prue laughs]
You've sort of got a fold
rather than a swirl.
Perhaps it should have been
just a bit tighter.
Okay.
It's beautiful and light.
The flavours are stunning.
It is a piña colada.
The coconut and the pineapple
is just there.
[Paul] It's a fantastic roulade.
Your drink's good. Nice.
[Ruby] Good.
[Paul] Thank you.
Thank you very much.

*Kim-Joy*
The theme is dreams, but also passion.
So you go to sleep, wake up
and passion follows?
[Kim-Joy laughs]
[Sandi] Wow. I have to go now, um...
[laughing]
[Prue] It's a real mixture
of absolutely exquisite piping,
and then really quite clumsy roulade.
[Paul] It's very thick.
There is no spiral in there at all.
Yeah.
Flavours are lovely, and I'm really
impressed with the passion fruit curd.
But I think the answer
is to have a thinner meringue...
-Right.
-...and a tighter swirl.

*Manon*
Looks very busy. It looks very neat.
Can't wait to see what the spiral's like.
It's broken up a lot. That's a shame.
That's delicious.
I think your two types of cherries
are a really good idea,
and you got a beautiful balance.
Tastes lovely. My mouth's still watering.
Ah, thank you.

*Rahul*
[Prue] It looks absolutely lovely.
[Paul] Nice and even all the way down.
The kisses look amazing.
Thank you.
What you've got is a massive meringue
with a little fold.
There is no spiral there.
[Prue] Meringue's quite chewy.
[Paul] Mmm.
You haven't baked it long enough.
It needed a little bit longer.
However, your interior is delicious.
Smooth, sharpness coming from the rhubarb.
It tastes lovely.
-Mmm-hmm. Thank you.
-Thank you.

*Karen*
I think your roulade looks pretty sad.
[Prue] It's flat.
-Yeah.
-[Paul] Let's have a look
at this, shall we?
[Prue] The actual swirl is there,
but the inside is so soft
-that it's all collapsed.
-[Paul] Yeah.
I think your meringue's
slightly underdone.
-Ah.
-Your outside is the only crispy bit
in there. Everything else in there
is soft and marshmallowy.

*Dan*
I love the decoration.
[Paul] It's so delicate,
and it does look neat as a pin.
You do have a spiral.
[Prue] You have a really good one, too.
I think those flavours are wonderful.
Really fresh, lots of different fruit,
the lime cuts right through
the sweetness of the meringue
and you've got the balance perfectly.
Good. [chuckles]
-Yes!
-Well, there you are.
[bakers applauding]
[Paul] The meringue is very, very good.
You need one hero,
and everything else works around it.
Lime's the one in that,
and I think it looks exquisite.
-Well done, Dan.
-Said well.
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.
-[whoops]
-Really well done.
Thank you.

*Briony*
[Paul] What you've got is cylindrical.
-But you've just lost that spiral.
-[Briony] Okay, sure.
-Maybe less meringue.
-Okay.
[Prue] What's all that?
That's the golden syrup.
There's a little bit of seepage.
[Prue] Mmm. Certainly
tastes like treacle tart.
[Paul] You do get the pear.
'Cause it sits on your tongue,
and then just melts away.
You've ticked every box on your flavours,
but the meringue's slightly too thick
and you lost the spiral.

*Jon*
It looks great.
I like the egg yolks on the top.
There is a bit of a spiral going on there.
[Prue] I'm longing to see
how the spherification works.
[Paul] Wow.
[Prue] Perfect.
It's a nice little touch, that.
I think it's delicious.
The passion fruit, you've really got
that flavour coming through,
and it's about the sharpness,
it's about celebrating the fruit,
you know.
-Wow.
-Thank you so much.
Cheers.


Jon, please, bring up your showstopper.
-Oh, yes.
-[Prue laughs]
Come on, people, give it up for the tutu.
[all laughing]
In attention to detail,
I'm in first position as well.
[all laughing]
I think the dome is spectacular.
The shine you've got on it,
the tempering of the chocolate,
the colour works as well.
I think the design at the bottom scares
the living daylights out of me.
It's a thing of beauty.
No, it is not.
-It is!
-[all chuckling]
Can we get your hot-sauce, please?
[Jon] Here it goes.
[Noel] Wow.
Wow. I think we need to get in there.
Clear and distinct layers.
[Prue] Beautiful texture, too.
It's really rich. It's delicious.
I think you've done a great job
'cause the flavour combinations
really work,
the raspberry and the chocolate together
with the opera cake.
-Thank you, Jon.
-And extra points for the outfit.
Cheers.

*Ruby*
Do you understand the word "sphere"?
What happened was, it had shattered
into so many pieces,
so I had to do a bit of a jigsaw
to try and have something.
[Paul] Nice reveal.
These are all my favourite flavours.
Pistachio. Passion fruit.
[Paul] It's very thick,
the walls of that tart.
[Prue] Too thick.
It's quite sickly.
[Paul] There's too much pistachio
which dries everything out.
It's very difficult to eat,
-if I'm honest.
-Right, okay.

*Rahul*
[Paul] We only wanted one globe,
you've done two,
and it's very elegant.
It's very Rahul.
Thank you.
It's beautiful.
Remind me what's in the sauce?
[Rahul] Oh, it's coffee crème anglaise.
So you first put it on the top, and then
it's slowly going to melt the rest.
I hope.
I'm so sorry.
It probably needed more sauce.
[Paul] It's quite strong, isn't it?
[Rahul] You should have, like,
seven-layer opera cake.
[Prue] Oh, beautiful.
[Paul] Yeah.
[Sandi] Wow.
[Prue] Look at that.
[Paul] It's very neat.
I love that flavour.
Come on, Paul.
It's fantastic flavour.
The coffee chocolate that
you put on the top, works so well
with the opera cake
and the crème au beurre,
as well with the coffee in it.
It's silky smooth, it's delicious.
You did a great job there, Rahul.
Thank you.
-Again. Thank you very much.


*Briony*
[Paul] It looks like it was too thin.
Particularly white chocolate,
it has to be quite robust.
Okay.
[Prue] It's like a creature.
Elegant, it's not.
But it is lovely, robust, family flavours.
Blood orange is just so great.
[Paul] And the texture of it is beautiful.
[laughs] The outside is a bit of a mess.
Yeah. I'll take that.

*Dan*
It was supposed to look like a peach.
It looks like a planet.
It's a... It's a planet then.
[Paul] Planet Dan.
[Sandi] Go, Dan.
Nothing for it now. Come on.
Come on.
I'm out of sauce.
It's going, it's going.
Oh. It's going
to go in, not out.
Oh, brilliant. Bravo.
[Paul] Let's take a big scoop.
[Prue] Oh, it is layered, I see.
[Paul] Very good.
-It's absolutely delicious.
-[Sandi laughing]
The tang from the fresh peach
married up with the sweetness
of the mousses
is very, very good.
And the caramel works well
with it as well.
Planet Delicious.
Yeah. Thank you very much.

*Manon*
[Prue] Very neat and pretty,
and I love the piping.
It's a beautiful thing, but I think
what you've done is lovely.
[Manon] Oh, God, this is not good.
-[Prue] Voilà.
-[all laugh]
[Prue] Look at that.
[Paul] That looks amazing.
The collar is so lovely and thin,
and the flavour's lovely.
[Paul] You've got this smooth
white chocolate that sits in the mousse
and then the kick from the raspberries,
it is stunning to eat.
I mean, really delicate, sophisticated.
I think that's a triumph.
Yeah. Well done.
Thank you. Thank you.
[mouthing] Well done.
[exhales]

*Karen*
Well, I think it's wonderful.
Thank you very much.
I think the design is very good.
I think it's highly effective.
[Karen] Come on, baby.
-What's gonna happen now is...
-[Sandi] There we go.
Very good.
Let's have a look inside here.
We've got chocolate brownie,
mascarpone cream
with raspberry liqueur
and raspberry syllabub.
It's absolutely delicious.
I wouldn't say it's elegant.
I think it's hugely decadent.
I do like the flavours.
It's a shame you missed
some of the key ones for me.
I'm not getting too much
of the raspberry liqueur.
It could have been a bit stronger.
Well, never mind. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

*Kim-Joy*
The whole universe concept,
you've got it. I think it's fantastic.
You've got a lovely shine as well.
I think it's wonderful.
This is the moment, Kim-Joy.
Come on now.
She talks to it as well.
[Sandi] There we go.
[Prue] Oh, look at that.
[Sandi] Oh, the umbrellas inside.
[Kim-Joy] Yay!
[Prue] Those turtles are just perfect.
[Paul] I think it looks amazing.
What's the flavour inside these?
Orange and orange liqueur.
That is very delicious.
[Paul] And what's lovely is,
you thought about how the sauce
was gonna blend with the chocolate,
which goes with the choux as well,
and the whole thing works together.
You've got the slight alcoholic kick
at the back of it as well,
and I think the design is flawless.
-Thank you so much.
-I think you've done a great job.
-Well done, Kim-Joy.
-Well done, Kim-Joy.
-Ah, thank you.
-Well done.
The comments are like the best comments
I've ever received.
I think Prue and Paul
are sold on space turtles.
[laughs]
It's rich, isn't it?
It was a good one,
and had I had a good day yesterday,
I would have been confident.
I feel okay now,
but now isn't when we're sitting
on those stools and waiting,
and I would be absolutely crushed.
[Briony] Over the two days
I think I'm at the bottom,
but I'm quite of the opinion sometimes
it's better to expect the worst
because then, if it happens,
you're not as surprised,
and then, if it doesn't happen,
winner, you know.
[Noel] Prue and Paul must now decide
who will be our fourth star baker
and who will be leaving the competition.
I have to tell you, I never
want to eat chocolate again.
[both laughing]
Paul's fine, aren't you?
Well, I don't know, um,
I think today with the weather
was a bit tricky.
But what happened was,
when they were pouring the hot sauce on,
I think it worked, especially Kim-Joy's.
Kim-Joy, I think, saved herself.
[Sandi] She needed to.
Dan and Jon have
got to be hovering up there.
I mean, the outside
didn't look great for Dan.
[Paul] But the interior was delicious
with those peaches.
-[Prue]I know.
-Dan's had a good week.
Gotta say Rahul as well.
Yeah, again.
Rahul's there again.
[Prue] The truth is,
it's Dan, Rahul and Jon.
And I want Jon to win on costume alone.
The person who went into the showstopper
with tears and tension was Karen.
She did a very good showstopper.
But frankly, I don't think
she's necessarily saved herself.
[Sandi] Briony's looked the saddest.
Basically what she spent three hours
doing was making a tart.
But we have to say,
this week is very unusual.
Terry is not here.
If Terry were here...
He might have been the one to go home.
...he might have been the one to go home.
Obviously, Prue and I need to
discuss this a little further.
Do you know what's the best thing
about all of this?
Noel and I have got no decision
to make whatsoever.
-We'll just go and play Frisbee, right?
-Shall we?
Yeah.
[bleats]
If my hands get clammy, I'm sorry.
Don't worry. Go for it.
Well done, bakers, another lovely week
with you in the tent.
Now, I get the joy of announcing
who is the star baker,
and if I tell you
that this week's star baker
did a peach of a showstopper,
I don't think you'll be surprised
to learn that the star baker is...
Dan!
[bakers applauding]
Planet Delicious.
Ah, that means I've got the horrible job
of sending someone home.
The person who's going home this week...
is...
...nobody.
-[gasps]
-You...
[laughs]
Oh, man.
[exhales]
[Noel] The judges felt it wouldn't be fair
to send someone home
with Terry not being here, so...
But the downside to that,
means that next week
there is a strong possibility that
two people might be going home.
[Briony] Okay.
Thank you.
And on that note,
it feels weird sending no-one home,
so I'm gonna go.
-See you later, guys.
-[all laughing]
-Bye, Noel. Take care.
-Cheers, pal.
-It's been great, yeah. Loving your work.
-Such a big fan. Bye, Noel.
See you then, mate. Take care.
Oh! Thank you.
[laughs]
I'll be better. I promise.
[Paul] Okay.
Phew.
Oh, that's so good, isn't it?
Do you know what, the great thing,
is that at the end of each show
you get a clean slate.
-I'm freed from the gallows.
-Oh, my God.
I'm so pleased I'm not going home.
My family, they will be giddier than I am.
They're so excited, my two girls.
Yeah. The dog's not too keen.
-Mate, you must have been close.
-Eh.
-It must have been close.
-If I was, all right. Well, well done.
You have to win it next week.
Debbie will be really happy
I'm through to another week.
A lot more stress in the house again.
But, yeah,
I know she'll be really pleased.
[Constance] Hello, daddy.
Hello, Constance. How are you?
Good.
Hey, guess what?
I was star baker.
And how did you get star of the week?
[laughing]
How?
Because I made a cake.
Very good and very tasty?
Yeah, very good and very tasty.
Now, I'm going to play with my doll.
Oh, I love you, too.
