** Kate **
-Hello
-Hiya.
[Paul] I think you've lost
a little bit of the stencil.
I always have a problem with things
you're not going to eat.
Nobody is going to eat a marigold.
-Oh, God. [laughs]
[Prue] Perhaps he's not.
[Paul] Was that all right?
-[Paul laughs]
The cake is all rose water.
It's not what we wanted in a fruity cake.
It's a rose cake.
Style above substance.

** Peter **
How much baking powder
did you put in there?
-Five teaspoons.
-Oh, yeah. It's burning my tongue.
But before the baking powder hits you,
you get a really nice coconut flavour.

** Tom **
If somebody said to me you're going to put
a whole pear on top of a cake
I would have said, no, that's silly.
It actually looks very striking.
[Paul] I think you have over-baked
the cakes, for sure.

**Julia**
[Prue] It's a little bit heavy.
I meant to squeeze a bit of juice
out of it and I forgot.
And you forgot.
Well, you're a nice honest girl.
-I can't lie.
-[laughs]

**Flo**
[Paul] I think it looks great.
It looks well baked.
Love the candied fruit on top of that.
You finished quite early, didn't you,
I noticed?
-You were sitting there for a while.
-I did, yeah. I could kick myself.
-Why?
-I left the lemon curd in the fridge.
-The lemon curd in the fridge?
-Yeah.
-Okay. Let's have a look.
-Here we go.
Hmm. That is good sponge.
Loads of orange flavour coming through.
Do you know, I think there is enough
citrus in there?
Lemon curd is lovely, but unless
you are very restrained about it
and only put the thinnest layer,
it would have been overpowering.
-It's nice that, Flo.
-I'm awfully pleased.
It's a shame about the "lemon kerd."

**Chris**
[Prue] I have never heard of a sponge cake
with no fat in it with only two eggs.
[Paul] I think your sponge
is baked to perfection.
Oh. I'll tell you what, it's got flavour.
Texture's not right in the middle
-because it all got squashed.

**Liam**
It is a bit stodgy.
It's a bit boring.
Urgh, God.

**Yan**
[Paul] I'm not getting a huge amount
of flavour through.
I'm getting the sponge
and I'm getting the apple.
Not light as air, but it is a good sponge.
And I think you've got away with it,
considering that was
-your second one, as well.

**Steven**
-It looks absolutely delicious.
-Thank you.
I love the bonfire flames.
The shine of the toffee is perfect.
-Beautifully baked.
-Thank you.
To get that texture of apple,
which is just slightly soft
and then you have those gorgeous
warming spices coming through.
The combination of flavours is perfect.
I mean, it's just like
a little sum up of autumn.
-Thank you.
-Very well thought through.
-[laughs]
-Well done.
-Well done.
-Very good.
-Thank you.

**Stacey**
[Prue] Looks as if
the apple has sunk a little.
[Paul] The bake's okay,
but I get a hint of cinnamon.
I'm not convinced that
the whole thing together works.

**James**
-I think it does look a little bit rustic.
-Hmm.
-[Paul] It's just mud.
-Wet in the middle.
[Paul] It's been flooded with water
all the time, while it's in the oven.
Nothing that a lot of custard
wouldn't help.

**Sophie**
[Paul] It's very neat. The piping's good.
[Prue] Oh, look at that sponge.
I think that texture's lovely.
The pineapple flavour comes
walloping through.
You must have dried
the pineapple a bit too?
Yes.
[gasps]
[laughs]
That's delicious.
-I mean, it really is.
-Oh, my gosh.
The pineapple that comes through there
is delicious and that silkiness
that come from the Italian meringue
just works so well with that.
-I'd have another piece of that.
-Wow. Thank you.



[Sandi] It's judgment time
for the show stopping illusion cakes. 
Yan, please bring up your illusion cake.
I think what you have produced there
is a work of art.
I love the way you've used
the Rice Krispies
and then the eggs look incredible.
[Prue] The little salmon roe,
it will taste like mango
and your brain is telling you one thing
and your taste buds telling you another.
We should be eating it
with the chopsticks.
Oh, look at that. Isn't that beautiful?
I think it's got a good banana flavour.
The cakes are slightly too dry.
It's unfortunate,
but that design is incredible.
[Paul] I think you could have
done more with it.
-It's not detailed enough.
-Yep.
I love the flavour.
I think it's a little dry.
-It so nearly worked, didn't it?
-[laughs]
[Paul] That glass looks great.
-Just such a shame you lost it at the top.
-[Kate] Yeah.
Texture's nice. Very moist.
Nice flavour. I like it.
[Paul] It's collapsed a bit there,
hasn't it?
It did. It needed more time
before I iced it.
Mmm, very nice flavour.
It's a bit dry, but the chocolate,
the coffee is delicious.
-It's a little bit basic on the outside.
-Sure.
This is so exciting.
-Oh, that's disappointing.
-We can see it.
-Oh, that's brilliant, that bit.
-[all laughing]
[Prue] Very almondy flavour.
But it comes down to the texture.
It's a little bit too dense for me.
Flo. Please bring up your illusion cake.
If you saw that in the greengrocer shop,
you would think it was a watermelon.
[Paul] I'm dying to see
what it looks like inside.
Wow.
[Prue] Oh, there you go.
-Look at that.
-[Noel] Wowzers.
[Paul] That's excellent there.
Now, this has got watermelon syrup
-in here as well, hasn't it?
-Yeah.
I want some with the chocolate in.
I can't really get the watermelon,
but then my mouth is full of chocolate,
what's the matter with that?
I think it's wonderful.
[Paul] Your sponge is spot on.
I love the colour you've got inside
and the chocolate just highlights it
and lifts it up.
-I love you, Flo.
-I love you too, now.
[laughs]
It's the fattest Russian Doll
I have ever seen.
-Proper Siberian.
-Is that right?
-Okay.
-[all laughing]
-[Prue] Oh, look at that.
-[applause]
[Paul] Right, let's see
if we can cut into her.
I find the cake a little bit plain
and a little bit dry.
It's a little bit simplistic.
[Prue] I think it's a pity
about the knife.
It's a bit dry.
[Paul] The flavour in there is beautiful.
Just think you've left it in there
a little bit too long.
I'm not certain that I would know
it was a handbag.
It's looks like a decorated cake
rather than a hang bag.
But what's more important is,
is it a great cake?
-I think it's delicious.
-Thank you.
Certainly a bit sticky in your mouth.
You wouldn't want to eat a lot of it
because it's so rich.
[Paul] The sponge is delicious.
What throws you is the colour.
Overall not really overwhelmed
by the design.
[Prue] I have to say,
the champagne bottle looks amazing.
It's really beautifully done.
-[Paul] Oops.
-[chuckles]
-I'll just get that before it melts.
-[all laughing]
-Surprisingly dry.
-Okay.
The ganache is making it even drier,
but the flavour
of the chocolate's nice.
Steven, please bring up
your illusion cake.
Wow.
That is stunning.
Without a shadow of a doubt
you know exactly what that is.
[Prue] Absolutely astonishing.
You wouldn't think that wasn't bread,
would you?
[Steven] It is a chocolate hazelnut sponge
with a peanut butter frosting.
It's perfect.
The hazelnut. The peanut. The frosting.
The layers are equal. The outside.
The colour, the texture, it's all there.
[Prue] And it's not too sweet.
I think it's lovely.
-Well done.
-[exhales]
-Well done.
-Thank you.
Well done.
Liam, please bring up your illusion cake.
Well, I have to say,
I think it looks delicious.
It makes my mouth water.
I want to come to yours for breakfast.
-Any time.
-It just...
It's just so lovely.
[all laughing]
I mean,
it really is very difficult to believe
that that's not pancakes.
I think it's ingenious,
but it's got to taste good as well.
There's a lot going on in here as well,
isn't there?
-Yeah.
-[Prue] Hmm.
Um... I was expecting more banana flavour.
I think that's because
the blueberries overpower it.
-Yeah.
-But it's delicious. A mouthful is lovely.
-Okay.
-I think your banana cake is beautiful.
-Well done, mate.
-Thank you.
Oh, gosh.
[Noel] Paul and Prue must now decide
who will be our first star baker 
and who will be the first
to leave the tent.
Standard's been ridiculously high,
hasn't it?
I think this is one of the strongest
challenges I've seen
-for the first programme.
-[Sandi] So, who has stood out?
Well, I think Flo came straight back with
a cracking good watermelon.
Sophie has been very constant.
Stephen didn't fail us on the showstopper.
Nobody wants to be the first person
to leave, but who is in some danger?
Liam saved himself with that showstopper.
It was stunning.
Stacey I think is in trouble.
This didn't look like a hand bag.
Peter hasn't done well.
Chris is full of good ideas.
His flavours are spectacular,
but his baking falls short.
Well, I have to say
none of it sounds straightforward.
We have to send somebody away, don't we?
