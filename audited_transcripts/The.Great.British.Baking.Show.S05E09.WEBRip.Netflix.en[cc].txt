Hello, Steven.
They look a bit untidy. And burnt.
They’re quite flat.
I think your craquelin
was probably a little bit too thick.
It has restricted the growth.
[Prue] Let’s have a go.
Wow. Okay.
I definitely think this is under baked.
The choux pastry is too soft.
Very soft. I think the craquelin has
kidded you into thinking they’re ready.
Oh, it tastes great though.
It tastes exactly like a key lime pie.
That is absolutely delicious.
It just doesn't look good.
I think you’ve done this on purpose
so they don't say style over substance.
The bakewell ones
look very untidy as well.
[Steven] Yeah.
It’s a bit too sweet for me.

*Sophie*
Bloody gorgeous, mate.
They just taste heavenly but look awful.
I think you have to eat it like that.
[Noel] Just dim the lights.
They do look beautiful.
Very nice shine on the chocolate.
All of those are the same size.
They do look a little bit flat.
I think it’s under baked.
Okay.
See how white that is there?
That could be darker.
Okay.
That’s kidding you that it’s ready.
So as it's sat and rested,
it’s just collapsed slightly.
Let’s have a look.
I don't get the rhubarb.
I get the strawberry.
The strawberry is stronger
than the rhubarb.
Yeah. Great flavour though.
And the craquelin’s nice and crisp.
Okay. Now these look a bit flat as well.
It’s very nice but I'd have liked
lots more chestnut.
It’s drowned by the chocolate.
I almost feel
a tinge bit of disappointment.
Oh, don't say that.
This is the semi-final and we really
are after absolute perfection.

*Kate*
I think they look really lovely.
All the ones with the brown craquelin
are the same size
and all the ones with the heart
look roughly the same size.
The craquelin has worked.
I think the colour is good.
It’s a beautiful golden brown.
We’ll start with the Valencia orange.
Yeah.
This is how I like to see
the choux pastry.
Soft in the middle
and crisp on the outside.
Mmm. Very nice orange taste.
The craquelin, it’s unbelievable.
I think the filling is delicious too.
I just think
you could have had more in there.
Now this is the peach Bellini.
That’s delicious.
Oh.
You have that peach in there.
You do get the prosecco flavour.
It really works.
Very, very good.
-Thank you.
-Well done.
Well done.
Thank you.

*Stacey*
This one is most unicorn-like.
I had to rush the eyelashes and things
and then I dropped stuff anyway,
it was a bit...
That’s a sentence
you don't hear very often.
"I had to rush the unicorn eyelashes."
They are a mess.
Oh, my goodness, look at that.
-Oh, come on.
-Fascinating colours.
I’m not sure it looks delicious.
It looks amazing.
You did such a lot of icing.
It’s very, very sweet.
-Yeah.
-It’s a bit sickly.
The craquelin.
I don't like the yellow colour.
Just trying to make it a colour.
Just trying to make it a bit different.
Looks like curry.
Looks like curry.
I hope it doesn't taste like curry.
It looks burnt as well. You’ve got
a dark bottom to the choux bun.
These are banana cream and salted toffee.
Mmm.
The flavours inside are good
but your textures are all wrong.
Not your finest hour.


Sophie, please bring up
your meringue centrepiece.
Wow.
Looks like a hat.
[Sandi] Oh, no, it’s not, it’s a tutu.
-It just looks like a hat.
-I would love to see you wear that.
What, the tutu or the hat?
Seriously, I’m game for both.
[Paul] I think
the design is very, very good.
I think your piping is good.
I think the bake on the bottom,
is that the French meringue?
Yes.
It's split an awful lot.
Wow.
Very nice meringue.
The Swiss and the French is very good.
Baked well as well.
Crispy, which is what
you need to be the base.
How many layers
have you got to this opera cake?
Nine, I think.
It should be seven.
Well, I had to fill it up.
Is that not good?
It tastes amazing.
The coffee mousse lightens it up
because the ganache is quite heavy
because it’s so thick.
If you had done the ganache
a little thinner
it would have been ten out of ten.
Well, I’m highly impressed.
-Awesome.
-Very well done.
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.
Phew. Thank God for that.
Kate, would you like to bring up
your meringue Showstopper please.
[Prue] Oh, wow.
-Wow.
-It’s colourful. Bit childish.
And the colours are just amazing.
They just shine out at you.
I just love the look of it.
I think it’s fantastic.
The rainbow itself is a little uneven.
-Needed to be neater.
-Yeah.
Every single colour
is a different fruit flavour.
Definitely raspberry. I like that.
Yeah, I get the different flavours.
They're a bit like sweets.
I think it’s wonderful.
I’ve got and Italian meringue
on the bottom,
which I’ve lightly blowtorched.
Delicious.
The flavours, the creams, the Swiss
meringue are all absolutely lovely.
It’s a bit of
a splat of flavour and colour.
For me it sort of
freaks me out a little bit.
You have to release your mind.
This is absolute celebration of fruit
and cream and meringue.
That is Kate on a plate.
Yeah.
-[Prue] I love that. Well done, Kate.
-Thank you.
Thank you.
[Noel] Stacey, would you like to bring
your meringue Showstopper up to the table?
A centrepiece needs to be
easily recognisable for what it is.
They are obviously birds.
It’s quite simplistic
but you’ve thought it through well.
I hope it tastes as good as it looks.
-It’s a nice meringue that.
-Mmm. Very good.
It’s chewy.
Now this is the Italian meringue.
It’s just too sweet and sticky.
And you can only bear
a little bit of that.
[Paul] It’s just very, very soft.
One is filled with a vanilla panna cotta
and raspberry coulis
and the other one is filled
with a raspberry lemon mousse.
-It’s like a takeaway dish isn’t it?
-It is. It is.
It’s probably not
the best thing in the world
but it’s very practical for what it does.
-It’s just very tart.
-[Stacey] Sorry, too much coulis.
It’s very nice.
You have the sweetness underneath.
It’s very creamy.
[Paul] That’s quite tart as well.
All of that meringue is so sweet,
you really do need
something sharp to go with it.
-Well done, Stacey.
-Thank you.
Thank you.
Steven, please bring up
your meringue centrepiece.
It was a hot air balloon and a basket.
It got too close to the sun.
Icarus.
Exactly. Yes.
The colours are just lovely.
I love those pastel shades.
I imagine if the chocolate basket
was still intact, you’d get it.
-Yes.
-But just looking at that,
I would think it was a tree.
-Psychedelic tree.
-Yeah, a psychedelic tree.
-I wouldn’t think it was a balloon.
-What happened with the cracking?
It took one crack
and then the weight just...did that.
That shouldn't have happened.
If you make a centrepiece you need it
to last for four or five hours.
[Paul] Okay.
So the top one is an Eton Mess?
Balsamic, strawberry and a clotted cream.
The flavour’s nice.
Execution? Probably not and that
comes down to the bake.
What you should've done was bake it
for longer to dry it out totally
to give it a more stable base.
It’s such a pity,
because it’s so delicious.
Now this is the Italian?
That’s the Italian meringue
with the lemon drop pie.
It’s so good.
It’s great. Very light.
Love the flavours. They taste amazing.
I mean, beautiful.
I just think the method,
the way you’ve done it
is not up to normal Steven standard.
-Thank you, Steven.
-Thank you.
