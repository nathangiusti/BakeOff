-[Prue] Hello, David.
-Hi, there.
I love that they look so unusual.
Never seen anything like that
in a pastry shop,
and I would want to buy one.
Colour's nice. It's all uniform.
If you're gonna put nuts around the
outside, blitz them down even smaller.
The smaller they are,
the more professional it'll look.
Love the flavour.
The bitterness that comes through,
it's from the aperitif which you've got
in the jelly form. It's delicious.
I don't think it looks particularly good,
but I do like the flavours.
-Particularly the rhubarb.
-Hmm.
Because the rhubarb cuts through
the general richness of it all.
-Can I have a slug of that?
-[David] That's for you.
The excuse is, it's a good palate clearer
for the next one.
[Paul] True.
-Thanks, David.
-Thanks.
-[Noel] Okay. See you.
-[laughs]

*Rosie*
I absolutely love the colour.
I think the size of them is perfect.
[Paul] The base don't look too bad.
[Prue] Nice little bits of pulled sugar.
I like that.
[Paul] It's a shame about the crème pât.
It needs cooking out a bit more.
It's just a bit too soft.
-The jelly is perfect.
-It's a shame about the crème pât.

*Steph*
It's not very neat down at the bottom
on any one of them.
[Prue] I like the design.
I love that, and the colours.
-It's akin to a lemon meringue pie.
-Okay.
The sharpness is there,
the flavours are there,
-but it's a bit too soft.
-Hmm.
I agree it's a bit soft,
but if you were eating it as a pudding
-with a spoon, you'd be fine.
-Yeah.
-[Prue] Nearly perfect.
-Thanks.

*Alice*
The dome, the shine you've achieved
is fantastic.
The pipework is not particularly good.
It's such a pity, Alice,
because that one is near perfect,
and some of the others
are really all over the place.
But the overall look
is pretty professional.
-Oh, my goodness.
-[Paul] It's held together quite nicely.
The pastry's lovely and crisp.
Nice flavour.
You've got a lovely buttery feel to it
'cause it crumbles in the mouth
and it melts beautifully.
The orange comes through.
-It's quite a big tartlet.
-Yeah.
But they are really good.
The only thing that let you down
was the piping.
-Yeah.
-But your flavours and textures,
and the actual base is stunning.
The flavours are gorgeous. Well done.
Thank you very much.

*Steph*
Steph, please bring up
your sugar glass case.
It's pretty clear.
It's quite like old antique glass.
I think you've done a good job.
[Paul] Let's have a look.
It's very neat.
[Prue] Very dark chocolate.
That looks very pretty.
-You're a very good baker, Stephanie.
-Oh.
You really are.
The sponge is more dense
than I'd have liked,
but on the other hand,
you've got so many layers,
if it had been very light,
it would've been difficult.
It's very patisserie in its style
by the use of the macarons.
Everything you've done is very neat,
very tidy, very Steph,
and the box is good, too.
Yeah, I think you've done a good job.
Thank you.
It's very neat.
And I love the coloured glass.
It's quite clear.
[Paul] You can see through it.
It's a bit mottled in places.

*David*
-[Prue] That's very neat, too.
-[Paul] It is very neat.
It has to be absolutely level,
and it's not, 'cause it bends down.
It's wonderfully light.
Like a very good carrot cake.
Quite spicy, as always with you.
-Blindfolded, I'd know that was yours.
-[chuckles]
Patisserie week is all about delicacy,
finesse, intricate detail,
and I think by putting sponge on sponge
on sponge on sponge,
I think it's slightly wayward.
You need something
more delicate, more finesse.
[Prue] I absolutely agree.
It would've been better if there'd been
a bit more showing off of patisserie work.

*Rosie*
I like the look of it.
Does look like old glass.
It's a good concept.
It's a bit simplistic,
considering it's a showpiece,
-it's a centrepiece, it's a showstopper.
-Yeah.
What's difficult is it's the same colour
all the way around.
[Prue] What you've done is interesting
'cause you've taken
a concept like time and family,
but it's the concept
that pulls them all together
not the gastronomic dish.
These are a bit boring, a bit dry.
-Dry and floury.
-Yeah, there's no flavour to it.
The little tarte
in the middle's delicious.
Thanks.
The religieuse are a little bit
off the mark as well
-'cause they're so small.
-Okay.
[Paul] You need to pack more of a punch.
But making that a centrepiece,
it's a tricky one, that one.
It's the mix
that doesn't quite work.

*Alice*
You can't really see much of it,
to be honest.
[Prue] If it'd been clear,
it would be astonishing.
That is really lovely,
and I like the boldness
that you've done a really big one.
Mmm, lovely flavour.
Very nice, the whole fresh raspberries
in there.
[Paul] There is flavour in there.
It's not particularly strong.
The strong part of it is the raspberry.
The raspberry comes through beautifully.
The weakness is the mousse
down at the bottom.
-Okay.
-It's not very mousse-like.
Your display is very good,
and it really shows off
what your theme was.


It was pretty tight
coming into the Showstopper.
How do we feel they did?
[Paul] It's moved round a bit.
Alice has done a great job.
That's a decent-looking entremets.
Steph did a great job.
She really bounced back,
actually, in the Showstopper.
[Prue] She showed us
a lot of patisserie skills.
And ones who you were not impressed by,
the one that looks like a...
Looks like a sandwich, doesn't it?
It's basically a stack of sponge cakes,
and although it's technically patisserie,
it's not what we were asking for.
[Paul] His cabinet, though, was very good.
If we have to tick the elegant column,
that's not gonna happen with Rosie's?
-[Prue] No.
-[Paul] I have serious issues with this.
Because the little cakes that she made
are so dry,
no flavour in them whatsoever.
I don't think picking Star Baker's
gonna be that difficult.
I think the hard one is
who's gonna leave us at this late stage.
-It's the worst time to go out, right?
-It is, because you're nearly there.
I trust you two. We'll go away
for five hours while you talk about it?
-[Prue] Yes, I think so.
-We could be a while.
Hello, bakers.
Well done for all your hard work.
I've got the great job this week
of announcing the Star Baker
and the person that will be going
straight through to the final.
So, the Star Baker this week is...
Alice.
-[clapping]
-[Sandi] Well done.
-You're in the final.
-[Sandi] Congratulations.
So, that means I have the horrible job.
It gets so difficult.
Er, one of you will not be going through
to the final.
Can I just say very well done to everybody
before I announce it,
but I'm afraid the person
who will not be joining us next week is...
Rosie. I'm so sorry.
-You did so well.
-It's okay.
You did an amazing job.
You pulled it back together.
Yesterday, you were incredible.
Well done, sweetheart. I'm so sorry.
[Rosie] I'm gutted. I am gutted.
I just have to be happy with everything
that I've done so far.
Oh, Rosie. You did so well.
Paul said it was just that one part
of that last bake.
Rosie tried to show a lot of skills,
but they weren't
a good collection together
and she didn't do them particularly well.
[Paul] Rosie slipped up...
Sorry, Rosie.
...which is the saddest part about it.
-But you are a bloody good baker.
-Thanks.
Likewise, David, who was also in line
for possibly going,
he basically made a cake.
[Prue] There's no doubt about it.
If Rosie had had a good day,
it would be David who was going.
I feel like
I could've just dodged a bullet.
Paul wasn't impressed,
and it just wasn't patisserie.
On the other hand,
Alice winning Star Baker...
Thank you.
[Paul] Alice is one to watch.
She's got stronger and stronger.
I'm probably gonna have
a mini-meltdown this week
from the pressure. [laughs]
-What a great week to go into the final.
-I know.
Isn't that wonderful?
We've got three very talented bakers
in there.
Oh, my God.
-[Prue] Well done, Steph.
-Thank you.
Three bakes to go.
They're very artistic bakers,
they're very imaginative.
If they all bring their A-game,
next week's final will be one
of the best finals we've ever had.
That feels good. I'm in the final.
