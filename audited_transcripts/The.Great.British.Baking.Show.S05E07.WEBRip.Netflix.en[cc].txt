*Stacey*
-Hi, Stacey.
-Hi.
[Paul] Erm, is that not meant to be
like that, then?
[Stacey] No. Well, no,
and I'll tell you why.
What's basically happened is,
I've put the raspberries
on the end of the wrong ones.
I have dipped them in the wrong thing.
[Paul] It's formed bubbles. It has got
some bubbles on there. Tiramisu?
[Stacey] Yeah.
Great flavours, tiramisu.
[Prue] That cheesecake one
is absolutely beautiful,
but the pastry, it's a bit doughy.
Let's have a raspberry one.
A bit chewy. It shouldn't be chewy.
It's underdone.
[Prue] The pastry dough started off brown,
it's very difficult to tell
-looking at it when they're fried enough.
-[Stacey] Yeah.
[Noel] When you were holding that one
I couldn't tell what was fingers
and what was cannoli.
I think you should rename
them "Hollywood Fingers".
I think-- Do you know what?
I might do. Little stumps.

*Liam*
[Paul] Great shell.
[Prue] Really beautiful bubbles.
[Paul] Okay, let's look at this
marshmallow chocolate.
Wow, okay.
-Pouring out, isn't it?
-[Liam] Yeah.
[Paul] Probably not
the best choice for filling.
[Prue] Hmm. The lemony one is delicious.
Very good.
What's this one again?
[Liam] Pistachios, walnuts, ricotta.
[Prue] You can really taste
all of that. Sensational.
Cheers.

*Steven*
[Paul] Look at the bubbles
on that. It's perfect.
We have milk chocolate,
honey and almond praline.
[Paul] I love the flavour.
I think the praline in there,
particularly, is very good.
Steven, that mocha one
is very unctuous, lovely.
[Steven] This is Italian lemon curd.
[laughs] Very sharp.
Hmm, it is sharp.
The flavour of that with
the Italian lemons is delicious.
It's so sharp. Well done.

*Yan*
[Paul] My biggest concern is
I don't see too many bubbles on them.
Some look quite flat
without too much activation.
The pastry itself is very, very thin.
Remind us of this one?
[Yan] Mint, lime and rose.
Nice bit of tartness.
The flavours in that are lovely.
[Yan] Honey and Amaretto.
-[Noel laughs]
-I don't think that's meant to happen.
Bartender is always ready for you.
[Prue] Your pastry is too tender
because I didn't squish that hard.
It just fell to pieces.
The cocoa has fooled you
into thinking it's ready.
It probably could have done
with a little bit longer,
I just think your shells
have let you down.

*Kate*
[Prue] They're certainly not
quite identical, are they?
I mean, some of them are a bit shorter,
some of them are more bubbly.
Got quite a few bubbles on some of them.
This is the Martini one, is that right?
[Kate] Yeah, espresso. Yeah.
[Prue] Not very alcoholic.
I am a little disappointed.
I thought there would be more.
-[Paul] This one?
-[Kate] Limoncello.
[Paul] I think the alcohol is all right.
-[Kate] This is the negroni.
-[Prue] They are very orange-y.
[Paul] The ricotta in that one
particularly, you can taste,
-which is delicious.
-Thank you.

*Sophie*
[Sophie] So, I have a lemon,
lime and ginger.
An Amaretto and almond
and a hazelnut and chocolate.
I've tried it with ricotta,
I just prefer the mascarpone.
[Paul] Right. It's gonna be fascinating
to try it with the mascarpone.
It's gonna be interesting to see
how this set in the shell itself.
This is a real test.
Hmm.
It doesn't pour all down you. It holds.
Yeah, very good.
This is not at all sloppy.
I think you might have converted me.
Awesome, thank you.
The almond and Amaretto,
mmm! That is heaven.
You got that slight dryness coming
through in the flavouring as well.
Yeah, I think you got three
very good cannolis there.
[Prue] If cannoli on the streets of Sicily
tasted like these, I'd be very happy.
I'm not sure I'd be welcome
after my use of mascarpone though.
[Noel] I think you should take that in
when you get your next
spray tan for the colour.
I think you should take that one in.
Thank you very much indeed.
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you.

*Liam*
Liam, I think that presentation
is just fantastic.
Lobster tails on ice.
It's just amazing to look at.
They're inconsistent in size.
But I think you've got great lamination.
I think the layers are fantastic.
Maple and pecan. Mmm, delicious.
What have you got inside this?
Rum soaked raisins, orange zest.
[Paul] The orange comes
through in that one, actually.
[Prue] Flavour's lovely.
I know that took hours
and it's a hell of an achievement.

*Steven*
Steven, please bring up your sfogliatelle.
Proper showstopper.
[Paul] Lobster tail, excellent lamination.
Style.
Come on, substance.
Style box, ticked.
And substance.
-[Prue laughing]
-[Steven grunts]
The chocolate, the little bit of heat
that comes from the ginger is delicious.
[Prue] Sicilian lemons
taste really Italian.
It goes on flaking in your mouth
because the pastry is so perfect.
[Paul] What you have done is sfogliatelle
which are authentic.
I think you could sell them
in any pastry shop in Italy.
-Well done.
-Thank you.

*Sophie*
[Paul] Great lamination.
You've got that classic lobster tail
running all the way through.
The time that you've spent on it,
you can see the intricacy.
So this is the cherry?
[Sophie] Yeah.
Hmm.
[Paul] It's got a nice bitterness to it,
which I think works inside.
I think that's like crisp leaves.
Chewing it you get
the passion fruit and mango.
It is quite a showstopper.

*Kate*
[Prue] I must say I'm a bit disappointed,
not only in the way they look,
the sfogliatelle,
but also because this was supposed to be
a showstopper presentation,
and it doesn't look
as if you're proud of them.
[Paul] Lamination,
there's big problems with that.
These look as though they've been sat on.
Hazelnut and chocolate.
Certainly got the hazelnut.
[Paul] Tahini and lemon.
Actually, it's quite pleasant.
If you close your eyes
and eat it, you think that's great.
But then you open your eyes
and see it and go, "Ah".
[Paul] You are not getting
much lamination.
Oh.
[Prue] Maple and bacon,
it's extremely Canadian.
Flavour's lovely.
But the consistency is quite doughy.
[Paul] The crème pat and the blueberry,
these ones are quite raw.
[Prue] You are obviously disappointed
and in a way,
we are a bit disappointed, too.
Bit of a mess.
Total mess.

*Stacey*
Stacey, please bring up your sfogliatelle.
[Prue] Erm... Sfog...
[Stacey] Sfoglia-teenies.
So they're for the kids.
[Prue] Oh, I see.
The lamination is very poor,
and there is too much icing sugar
on there, which is unusual for you.
Normally, you smash something
like this and it looks good.
[Prue] It's the heat, I think.
[Paul] Citrus and raisin...
I like that filling.
I think it's the right degree
of sweetness.
[Paul] It's very runny for a crème pat.
You were so ambitious
to do a choux paste middle.
[Paul] Your nightmare's come true.
The choux bun has burst out and on the top
there you have raw dough.
I appreciate the fact
that it's extremely difficult to do,
but everyone is in the same boat,
and we have to judge accordingly.
I agree.
[Paul] And this one, I think
you have let yourself down a little bit.
