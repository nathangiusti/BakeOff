-Hi, Michelle.
-Hi, Michelle.
-Hi.
-Well, I have to say, they look exquisite.
-Thank you.
-They really do.
-I love that splash of colour.
They're all identical as well,
which I like.
Definitely taste like Bakewell.
First thing you get is almond.
The biscuit texture's very, very good.
The temptation to eat
this second mouthful is impossible.
-[laughter]
-Oh, thank you.
-[Prue] Very good.
-[Paul] They are unique.
I've never had anything like it before.
-I think they're exceptional. Well done.
-Thank you.

*Amelia*
[Paul] Rough and ready, aren't they?
[Prue] Rustic.
I don't think that's cooked properly.
-Oh.
-[Paul] Your biscuit
could've done with
a bit more baking.
Feels like a paste.
-Okay.
-It does, yeah.
But the nougat's delicious.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

*Henry*
[Paul] They look
really neat actually.
You've got a beautiful shine
on that chocolate.
The mousse is right round the--
[Henry] The mousse
is round the shortbread.
It needed a bit longer
to set, that mousse.
I think the flavours are beautiful.
-That cardamom really lifts it up.
-So ambitious to do six layers.
Really, you've pulled it off,
-it's just that that mousse hasn't set.
-Yeah.

*David*
They look a bit messy on the side.
The nougat kind of sloughed out of it.
It didn't work as well...
-Sorry, "sloughed"?
-"Sloughed"?
Like when you've got
a sloughy wound,
-all the pus coming out of it.
-Just like that.
-It was kind of doing that.
-David, thank you.
[all laughing]
[Paul] I like the blend
of the nougat with the bitter chocolate,
and you do get that coconut as well.
-It just looks a bit messy.
-Yeah.
-But well slacked and sloughed.
-[chuckles]

*Michael*
I mean, they look quite chunky,
don't they? But they look neat.
[Prue] Hmm.
[Paul] The textures are good
except for the marshmallow.
The marshmallow's not quite right.
-[Paul] Not quite set.
-Yeah.
[Prue] I love the lemony middle.
I think that's genius.
The lemon and the rosemary
come through beautifully.
Marshmallow adds
a little bit of sweetness,
and the dark chocolate
that little bit of bitterness.
So you have the perfect blend
of all the flavours.
[laughter]
You all right, darling?
Do you want a chair?
-Thanks, Michael.
-Thank you.

*Steph*
[Paul] They look fairly neat.
Pretty uniform.
I like the idea of this coffee biscuit.
Oh, no.
It's very crumbly.
I've put semolina in there.
Ah, that's what it is.
I like the crumbliness.
I'm less keen on the coffee flavour,
I think it's a bit too strong.
Okay.

*Phil*
They do look a bit messy.
-Thank you.
-[laughter]
Perhaps they taste better than they look.
[Paul chuckles]
Watch your fingers, Prue.
-[Prue] Remind me what the top is?
-[Phil] It's a fudge.
It's certainly a sugar rush.
It's a pleasant flavour.
Right at the end, you get the cranberries,
so you get that little kick of bitterness.
-You need that because it is sweet.
-Mm-hmm.
I just don't think
it looks particularly good.

*Helena*
[Prue] I don't actually want to bite
the end off this finger.
-Think she nailed it.
-[laughter]
I'm working here, people.
I'm fearing Paul's reaction here.
It's a bit boring.
The biscuit's got that feeling
of being slightly stale.
It's almost got that flavour, to me,
of being slightly stale too.
Maybe you don't like
the flavour of matcha?
I understand. It's like Marmite.
-But they're very original.
-Thank you.

*Alice*
[Prue] They look absolutely identical.
They're nicely made.
[Paul] Let's have a look inside,
shall we?
Hmm. Very nice hokey-cokey flavour.
It's delicious 'cause you've got
so many textures,
including the honeycomb.
-The peanut's fantastic.
-Mm.
You've done really well.
-[inhales] Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done, Alice.
-Sigh of relief.
-[Alice mimics sigh]
-Yeah, thank you very much.
-Excellent.
-Thank you.
-Thank you. [sighs]

*Priya*
[Paul] I wanted something more,
even if you'd spun white chocolate on it
or done some effect.
You struggled with the time,
didn't you?
-Yes.
-Yeah.
This is going to be the first time
I've eaten ruby chocolate.
The chocolate's got a nice kick to it,
but it's too thick.
The biscuit inside, I'm not getting
any flavours 'cause what's happening is,
the chocolate's overtaken everything.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

*Jamie*
-[Paul] What happened?
-I put the caramel in too hot.
It's like biscuits after an earthquake.
[laughter]
Jamie, that's an awful lot of caramel.
It's pretty sickly.
I can't really identify more flavours.
I wish I could say that it looks dreadful
and tastes fantastic,
-but...
-It looks great as well? [laughs]
[all laugh]
Funnily not.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

*Rosie*
[Prue] They look absolutely magnificent.
Beautifully feathered.
I love that.
It's not too sweet.
I think the balance between
the lime and the mint is perfect.
The biscuits are beautiful.
And this is a biscuit bar
and we're really focussing on the biscuit.
It's biscuit week
and your biscuits are beautiful.
I think it's delicious. Thank you.
-Very good.
-Thanks.

*David*
[Paul] It looks beautiful, the work
you've done with the shortbread,
you've done an amazing job.
And the decoration is so skilful.
It's beautifully done.
[Paul] Very delicate.
[crunching]
Delicious.
The fennel really works
with the citrus together.
The tuiles are delicious.
They snap.
You've thought that through.
I think that's excellent, David.
-[Noel] Well done.

*Michael*
I think it looks great. It is ingenious.
Oof. There's some chilli in there,
isn't there?
In fact, there's a lot of chilli in there.
[inhales sharply]
I quite like it. It's underbaked,
it's gone really soft.
But the heat coming through is great.

*Henry*
[Prue] I'm a little disappointed, Henry.
I had this vision of being able to see
all the pipes soaring up to the heavens.
-Yeah.
-Where's the keyboard?
Er, the... It... The lid's closed.
-That's handy.
-[laughter]
[crunching]
They're certainly crisp,
but they're a bit too thick.
Pull my teeth out. [chuckles]
[Paul] I think your flavours
are delicious,
but they're a bit too thick,
them, for sure.
-[Prue] Yeah.
-You could've done better.

*Steph*
[Paul] It's a cat version of
a gingerbread house. It's very clever.
-Oh, dear.
-[Sandi] Ah.
It's nice and thin.
Snaps beautifully.
Good kick of ginger at the end,
-but I think it's slightly overbaked.
-Okay.

*Phil*
[Prue] I think it's so clever
the way you've curved the legs slightly
in the way that tortoises
get along. [laughs]
[Sandi] I love you doing
a tortoise impersonation.
That's, er... That's made my day,
that has.
[Paul] I'd have liked to have seen
more colour on those Florentines.
They need to be in the oven much longer.
It's way underdone.
-[Prue] Mm, yeah.
-[Paul] It's a shame.

*Amelia*
I was expecting a bit more
definition on the dolphin.
I can't really make it out. [laughs]
Amelia, I'm a little disappointed
that you used stacking.
We did say we wanted you
to use dough as if it was clay.
It's got a nice snap to it.
I think they're baked well,
although it could carry more flavour.
I think it's okay.
It doesn't blow my mind.
Thank you.

*Rosie*
[Paul] That's highly impressive, Rosie.
It looks incredible.
[Prue] It's just stunning.
With little tuile-style biscuits,
which taste great.
[Prue] That's such a delicate biscuit.
It's really good.
The gingerbread is very, very soft,
-which is a shame.
-Okay.
[Paul] It needed a little bit longer
in the oven.
It's fascinating what you've done.
-I think artistically it is fantastic.
-Superb.
The whole composition is a triumph.
Thank you.
-You're a very, very clever vet.
-[chuckles]

*Priya*
[Prue] I think it's astonishing.
It's really elegantly done,
and the piping is exquisite.
[Paul] It's a work of art.
I think it's beautiful.
The colours look lovely.
The langues de chat,
they're disappointing.
They are really tough,
whereas langues de chat
should be very delicate.
The look of it is good,
but how many times have we said
style and substance?
You've got to have both.

*Michelle*
I must say the dragon looks
a little clumsy.
-I ran out of time.
-[Prue] Yeah.
Remind me of the ingredients.
Pistachio, cardamom,
lemon zest and coconut.
I think that's one of the most
interesting biscuits I've ever tasted.
-[Sandi] Oh, wow.
-[Prue] It really is delicious.
It is packed with flavour,
and the texture's beautiful inside.
I think you've done Wales proud.
Oh, thank you. Mmm. [laughs]

*Alice*
-[Paul] Looks great.
-Thank you. [chuckles]
It's a very big sheep
in a very small field.
[laughing] It's very sweet.
[Paul] I think the macarons
have done a fantastic job.
-[Prue] Lovely.
-They do taste great.
The white chocolate and the coconut
really come through.
That shortbread is really citrusy
and sharp and lovely.
And it does break down beautifully
in the mouth, and it's well baked.
And I love the whole sculpture,
because it's funny.
I think that's a fine piece of work.
-Thank you so much.
-[Prue] Really good.

*Jamie*
[Prue] Well, it's unmistakably a guitar.
It's quite simple.
It's all a little thick and clumsy.
And there's too much icing on there.
Your piping is, erm, not the best.
-Beautiful biscuit.
-Oh, thank you.
Delicate, light, lovely lemon flavour
coming through.
That biscuit is so delicious.
Decoration's not bad.
I quite like the colour.
-It's just a little bit clumsy.
-[Jamie] Yeah.
-[Paul] I think you could've done better.
-Yeah.

*Helena*
I think that is the most sculptural piece.
Artistically it's superb.
The spider looks very impressive.
[Prue] The Earl Grey is interesting,
the leaves in the shortbread.
I'd never have thought of that,
but it actually works.
I think I have to eat
a bit of the spider too now.
That works beautifully as well.
It's nice and bitter.
[Prue] Very interesting.
-[Helena] You can have it, Noel.
-[laughter]
Your friend. Are you happy now?
[Sandi] It was crawling
towards you anyway.
[Paul] Overall, I think you've done
an amazing job.
You've obviously got
a massive artistic flair. It's magical.
Oh, thank you, Paul.
-[David] That's really cool.
-Absolutely amazing.


I should be euphoric, I'm still worried.
Getting sweaty palms again.
[Jamie] I was really happy
with the comments on the shortbread.
I could've probably done better,
but it's just the pressure of the tent.
I don't think they've seen me at my best,
but it's out of my hands now.
[Amelia] The comments from the judges
were disappointing. I could be in danger.
There's always a chance
that two of us can go,
but I hope it's not today,
'cause then there's more of
a chance that it'll be me. [laughs]
[Noel] It's decision time
for Paul and Prue.
Who will be the Star Baker,
and who will leave the tent?
Here's something I never thought I'd say.
What about that chicken?
-[Prue] Wasn't it amazing?
-[Sandi] It was fantastic.
[Noel] Powerful.
[Paul] Rosie's doing well, actually.
I think, overall,
there's some people that really excelled.
David did well.
-I thought his Showstopper was amazing.
-It was amazing.
-[Paul] Those flowers.
-[Prue] It was exquisite.
-[Paul] And Alice.
-[Prue] Alice's sheep
made me laugh so much. It was such
a sweet sheep, but really well baked.
So they're in line for Star Baker.
I thought Helena
coming into this challenge
was in a little bit of trouble,
but that spider, unbelievable.
But that is what can happen
in the Showstopper, isn't it?
-It just bumps them straight up.
-[Paul] Yeah.
[Sandi] It feels as though
Amelia's in some trouble.
[Paul] I think Amelia struggled.
Biscuits are not her thing.
And Jamie. He was eleventh in Technical
and bad in the Signature.
[Prue] His Showstopper tasted delicious
but quite clumsy-looking.
I think either one of those could go.
Or two.
-Or two.
-Or two.
Could we go?
-Absolutely.
-Okay.
[Sandi] Well done, bakers.
That is week two in the bag.
Many congratulations. Now, I do not think
it is going to be a surprise to anybody
when I announce who is the Star Baker.
It is somebody who pretty much nailed
in first place every single one
of the three challenges.
This week's Star Baker is Alice.
[cheering and applause]
That leaves me with the horrible job
of announcing who's leaving us.
And the person who's leaving us
this week is...
Jamie. [tsks] Sorry, mate.
It's all right.
-[chuckles]
-[Michelle] Aw.
I think it's sort of mixed emotions.
Obviously, I'm a bit gutted,
but I'm also, like, proud of myself
for what I've done.
You don't get in the tent
unless you're a good baker. Don't stop.
It's just a great experience,
that's why I just don't want it to end.
I'm just mainly gonna miss everyone, so...
What a bittersweet moment.
I'm absolutely devastated for Jamie.
Obviously, I'm relieved that it's not me.
Through to next week.
That's a relief, definitely.
I'm just really determined
to prove it to myself
that I'm good enough to be here.
[Amelia] Alice. Well done, mate.
You deserved it.
You did really, really well.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe I'm Star Baker.
-Thank you so much.
-[Prue] You deserved it.
[laughs] Thank you.
I'm so happy. Just over the moon.
Hi, Ede, it's me.
-[woman on phone] Hello, darling.
-[man on phone] How'd you do? How'd it go?
I got Star Baker.
-[man on phone] Well done.
-[woman on phone] Oh, wow! Wow! Wow!
[Alice laughs] You're on speakerphone,
by the way.
-[woman on phone] I'm on camera?
-[Alice] Yeah.
[woman on phone] Oh, my God.
I'm eating my salad here,
and I've got bits of cress in my teeth.
-[laughing]
-Oh, darling...
