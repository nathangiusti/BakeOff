*Ruby*
Oh, God.
That’s how thin it should be
and that actually is the right structure.
-That is nice.
-Hmm.
Well done. That’s what I expect.
I think that’s a very good colour.
So that’s tandoori chicken and some raita
is sitting on the bottom
and some cucumber ribbons.
I think the flavour of that’s good.
I think it works together as a sandwich.
Okay.
Very well-balanced.
There is a little bit of chilli there.
-Yeah.
-I like it all.
This is the avocado on there as well?
Yes, um, avocado, asparagus,
chorizo and quails eggs.
It’s a real celebration of rye,
particularly in that one.
Good.
It’s very good. It’s like the
Mediterranean meets Denmark. Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done.

*Manon*
[Paul] I’d like to have seen
more colour in that.
[Manon] Okay. Inside, yeah?
Um, and more dense and filled
with seeds preferably.
-Yeah.
-Right.
So we have goat cheese with
roasted beetroots,
some strawberries, some glazed vinegar.
The flavour of your rye is not strong.
Also I think it lacks savouriness.
It’s so sweet.
Okay, sweet. Uh-huh.
It almost needs seasoning, doesn't it?
-Otherwise it’s just like um, pudding.
-Cheesy.
The chutney, the walnut, the cheese,
as a sandwich, it’s great.
But as a Danish open sandwich?
Do you know what bread that is?
Pain de campagne.
-Oh really?
-Yeah, you’ve made a French loaf.

*Kim-Joy*
You’ve definitely got a rye in there
and it is baked well.
Okay.
And this is a very
beautiful looking texture.
I hope it tastes as good as that.
[Paul]
They are beautiful looking sandwiches.
Flavours are good.
I can really taste the rye.
[Paul] I think
the dill makes it authentic
and so does the fish,
the avocado and the capers.
I just... It just needs to be
a little bit stiffer,
more seeds and I think you would have been
nearly there, to be honest.
Yeah, it was all right. It’s fine.

*Briony*
-Can you imagine Prue...
-Yes.
...walking into a, uh,
little coffee shop...
-Is that Prue’s walking?
-Is that how she walks?
-That’s her walk. She walks in and says...
-Yes.
"Excuse me,
would you mind making a sandwich?"
So... And you turn round
and give her that.
Yeah. Yeah? To be honest with you,
I just... Yeah,
I appreciate they’re too big.
I do apologise on that front, yes.
I know, okay. They’re too big.
Let’s try and judge them anyway.
[Paul] What is this?
Chorizo, Ibérico ham and sweet potato
with a fig jam.
I tasted the white rye by itself
and it doesn't taste much of rye.
Right, okay.
It’s more like a malted loaf than a rye.
Okay.
This is even more difficult to...
It's like building my own sandwich here.
I would have thought the smoked mackerel
would have been perfect
but it’s quite dry.
Oh, okay.
It’s not rye enough,
it’s not dense enough,
it’s not at all like an open sandwich
bread. So you’re in another challenge.
[Paul] It’s a shame.

*Rahul*
It just gone really soggy.
It’s so dense
it’s almost like a cake there.
There’s no air holes in it at all.
But it does look, to be honest, Rahul,
a bit of a mess.
Yeah.
Um, oh, dear.
Oh, no.
Not for me, mate. The bread’s awful.
It’s like it’s turning back into
a dough in my mouth.
Paul is right, it’s...
-Very stodgy.
-...very heavy and gluey.
It was the proving and you know that.
Yeah. I knew that it was the proving.
Actually that reminds me of a flavour
of a sandwich I had in Copenhagen.
I’m avoiding eating the bread because
I don't think it’s entirely edible.
I think you just did too much.
You tried too hard.

Ruby, please bring up your kagekone.
And this is your sister?
This is my sister when she was younger.
She’s got a very fun, bubbly personality.
-It’s absolutely sweet.
-Oh.
It really is.
[Paul] Danish pastries
looks like Danish pastries.
See the layers,
how tight they are together.
There’s butter still in there.
It’s crispy on the outside. If you’d
glazed it, it would have been nicer.
Oh, really?
[Paul] With apricot jam.
[Ruby] Apricot jam?
[Prue] Apricot jam.
[Ruby] Right, okay. Fine.
I think the pastry’s lovely, but Paul is
right about the apricot glaze.
-Not just for its look...
-Yeah, for the taste.
...but because you need a little
bit more sweetness in it.
Okay.
But it’s buttery.
I can feel that on my tongue.
-Hmm, yeah.
-You have your honeycomb.
Hmm, hmm.
-Yeah the ginger works.
-That’s delicious.
Thank you.
Overall I think it’s really nice.
I think the design’s effective.
-It’s really nice.
-Yeah, simple and effective.

*Manon*
[Prue] I must say,
I think the way that you’ve
done the skirt with the plaiting
of the marshmallow
and the face and the bow on top is
all beautifully done. Lovely.
So what filling have you put
inside your Danish?
So I just have a bar of chocolate
and the rest is just plain.
I like it plain.
Hmm, is that a Danish
or is that a pain au chocolat?
One, two, three.
[all] Ahhh!
[all laughing]
It is a little undercooked in the middle
and overcooked on the outside.
[Paul] Your oven was too high and you kept
it in there for too long.
The first thing that happens
in a Danish pastry
is butter leaks away from the Danish,
soaks onto the tray, gets drawn up from
the bottom of the pastry
and then that flashes with the heat.
And it fries at the bottom.
The bottom fries.
Yeah. So that’s, that’s
what’s happened there.
And it’s not just happened on this,
it’s happened on all of them.
Hmm.
I mean that’s been sitting in a pool
of butter and now it’s solidified.
It’s congealed. Mmm.
And these chocolates.
Hmm. It’s good.
The sweets are very, very good.
Very professional looking, actually.
Your pastry, however,
I have a big issue with.
I think your baking was,
was pretty poor on this.

*Kim-Joy*
I don't think I’ve ever
seen more exquisite piping.
-Thank you.
-It’s amazing.
Um, so it represents my friend Charlotte
and it’s her wearing, like, a gown.
The design of it is impeccable.
I mean it’s very, very good.
However, for me, you’ve had issues
with the butter. It’s all gone.
Yeah.
It’s dry. You see the big gaps?
That’s where the butter’s gone.
Ah.
So what you’re left
with is just the dough.
It’s definitely, sort of,
under-baked or soggy.
You’ve under-proved this thing.
I think I worried that, um,
it was quite warm
so the butter might be getting
too warm, so I baked it sooner.
Hmm.
-Shall we do the other filling? This one.
-Hmm.
What have you got in that, um...
Is that crème pat?
-Mmm-hmm.
-What’s in there?
Um, with...
Almond liqueur crème pat?
[crying]
It’s okay. It’s okay.
It’s very nice and strong.
I love that.
Marzipan’s good. Chocolate’s good.
The jellies are nice. The pastry not so.
Mmm-hmm.
Thank you, Kim-Joy.

*Briony*
In the Danish pastries you’ve got ginger
crème pat with some dried blueberries.
And then it’s got vanilla marzipan
and then there’s some sherbet.
And some toffee on her shoes at the bottom
and a marshmallow necklace as well.
It’s not a beard. It’s a necklace.
-It’s got a lovely flavour.
-Oh, good.
Quite like the blueberries in there
and the colour’s nice.
See the colour, that’s the colour
you’re looking for.
-Good.
-And this is sherbet, is it?
Yes that’s sherbet on the bag, yep.
[Briony laughs]
-It is, yeah.
-It’s good, isn’t it?
Overall, it’s got a nice flavour.
You’re the closest one
to get the Danish pastries.

*Rahul*
It’s just burnt. You left it in the oven
ten minutes too long.
Probably yeah, just yeah.
But I love the way you’ve used the round
ones for the buttons
and it looks positively
Indian and jewelled.
Uh-oh, here we go. Are you ready?
[all] Ahhh!
Bring this over.
It’s tough.
Very dry. Really dry.
Um, marzipan’s lovely.
-Very nice.
-It’s got a nice flavour.
-[Prue] Shall we have a jelly sweet?
-Yeah.
-Perfect. Ooh, yeah.
-Very nice.
And that one is summer mixed berry.
That’s nice, too.
And the hard buttons are basically,
uh, filled with raspberry jam.
Mmm.
-Well, I love all your sweets.
-Yeah.
-The pastry is a bit disappointing.
-Yeah.
-Thank you, Rahul.
-Yeah, thank you.


There’s been a lot of movement,
hasn't there?
I mean, in terms of the rankings?
I think some did better than others.
I think Briony’s picked herself back up.
I also think Ruby’s done well.
I think Kim-Joy’s slipped down
in contention of leaving,
as well as Manon and Rahul
are in serious trouble.
In trouble.
Yes, I mean Manon did spend, for me,
far too much time making beautiful sweets
and not enough time filling her pastry,
which would have made a huge difference.
[Sandi] What about Rahul?
[Paul] He burnt ‘em basically, yeah.
[Prue] If you over-bake the pastry
and all the butter runs out.
I think I know who’s gonna be Star Baker.
We need to talk about that,
but to who’s going home...
-You guys have another cup of tea.
-I’ll put the kettle on.
Yep. I’ve got a bottle of fizz for myself.
[laughs]
Right my lovely bakers,
I have loved Danish Week.
I thought it was great. And I have the
pleasure of announcing the Star Baker.
Now, this is getting harder
and harder I have to tell you,
but there can be only one,
like, there can
only be one mermaid in Copenhagen Harbour.
So the Star Baker this week is...
Ruby.
[all cheering]
-Aw!
-Oh, man!
That means that I’ve got the horrible job
of sending one of you home.
And, um, yeah,
this is gonna be a nightmare.
The person who’s leaving
us this week is...
Manon. I’m sorry.
What?
[crying]
Manon, you know what?
You should be proud of yourself.
I mean, you know,
to get this far is amazing.
I know.
[sighs] It’s gonna be okay.
Oh, Manon.
It’s just baking.
-You did really well, Manon. I’m so sorry.
-Thank you.
Ironically it was on a pain au chocolat.
I’ve learnt so much.
So many things I didn't even thought
I’d be able to actually make.
I’m a stronger and a stronger baker,
and hopefully a stronger person.
I am sad to see Manon go,
she’s a really good French baker.
Just not a very good Danish one.
[Paul] Next week, Rahul.
Start upping it up.
I’ll, I’ll try. I’ll promise you I’ll try.
I didn't expect that.
Just, just, like... Yeah.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you. Thank you.
That sounds so silly in my head that I’m
through to the semi-finals, like, what?
See you next week. Oh, my God.
-Well done, Ruby.
-Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Ruby’s done it. I’m very happy for her.
If there was a time to get Star Baker,
this is when you get it, going into the
semi-finals, it gees you up.
I got Star Baker.
[screaming on phone]
I told you I’m the quiet one.
I told you I’m the quiet one.
