-[Prue] Hello, Priya.
-Hello.
Hi, Priya.
I love the decoration.
It's simplistic, but effective.
[Noel] I'm getting Wham! video.
-[Priya] Yeah, "Club Tropicana".
-Yeah.
[Paul] Let's have a look inside.
-Looks like a good piece of cake.
-Wow.
[Prue] Lovely colour.
-I think you've got what you asked for.
-[sighs]
It's light, it's very summery.
The tropical fruits in there,
it gives it that gorgeous citrus flavour.
-I think it's a well-baked...
-Original.
...different cake.
-[Priya and Paul] Thank you.
-[Prue] Excellent.

*Jamie*
[Paul] It's got a very Easter feel,
hasn't it?
He made eyeless chicks.
He didn't want them to see the horror
of your judging. [laughs]
[Prue laughs]
[Paul] It holds together beautifully.
That is delicious.
It is mostly marzipan, which I love.
The fruit content in there is perfect.
That's a great bake. It's a great flavour.
-Well done.
-Thank you very much.

*Henry*
[Henry] It was a hut,
but it's now a little bit of a wreck.
My hands were a bit shaky.
-[Noel] I saw it. It looked amazing.
-[Henry] Noel did see it.
-It looked beautiful.
-[Henry] I promise you he saw it.
[Prue] More important is the bake.
Henry, you have made a very good cake.
Oh, thank God.
I think the texture's beautiful,
it's well-baked.
I think it's a great cake.
Yay! Thank you.

*Amelia*
Lovely definition, great colour.
I like the stars as well.
-[Prue] Did that bit stick a bit?
-A little bit, yeah.
[Paul] Well, you can't say
there's no fruit in there.
[laughter]
It's very moist, but I think the flavour
is absolutely lovely.
It screams Christmas.
That's a great tea loaf. Well done.
Ah! [laughs]

*Phil*
Do you know,
I think it looks absolutely beautiful.
I like the way you've iced
between the ridges,
which you've got out
of the tin perfectly.
-Oh, my goodness.
-[Paul] Marzipan right down the middle.
[Prue] Perfect.
-Quite spicy.
-And that's all you get.
You don't really get the fruit.
Just think the flavours
are slightly out of balance.
-Okay. Thank you.
-[Prue and Paul] Thank you.

*Helena*
I had trouble with the decoration.
Just could not work it out.
-If it's not right, don't put them on.
-Lesson learned, yeah.
It is very spicy.
[Paul] It's almost savoury.
I quite like it actually.
I've never had anything like it before.

*Michelle*
When you put the icing on,
was the cake still warm, I take it?
Yes, it was.
[Prue] Which is why
the drip hasn't really worked.
[Paul] But I think it looks attractive,
good colour.
[sighs]
[Noel] That's not the noise
you wanna hear, is it?
-[Michelle] No.
-[imitates sigh]
[laughing]
Texture is a little bit tough for me,
but I think the flavour is fantastic.
Okay, thank you.

*Steph*
I think it's
a great-looking cake actually.
Great colour.
[Prue] Very nice.
-[Paul] It's a juicy cake, isn't it?
-[Prue] It's delicious.
[Paul] The apricot
comes through beautifully.
I just want to pick up that slice
-and walk out with it.
-Feel free.
I can't, I've got a few more...
I was gonna say
you've got a few more left. [laughs]

*Rosie*
The cake looks a little bit sad.
-It does.
-[Paul] A bit flat.
Shall we have a taste of it?
I'm hoping it'll be lovely anyway.
-Cinnamon.
-Mm.
You've gone a little bit
overboard with that.
It's very chewy,
and it hints at being underbaked.
Hmm. Back to the drawing board.

*David*
It's a lovely-looking loaf.
Very good marzipan.
Maybe slightly too much almond essence.
[Paul] The moistness, great.
The texture is perfect.
I think if you'd pulled back
on the almond essence,
you would've had a perfect loaf.

*Alice*
You'd hang that on a door,
wouldn't you?
-[Alice chuckles]
-Well, it is a wreath.
-[Paul] Christmastime.
-[Prue] Christmas wreath.
-[Paul] I love ginger.
-Yeah, it's got a kick to it.
It has.
The crystallised ginger is beautiful.
You could've pulled back a little bit
on the other ginger.
Nice idea.
Sometimes, going back to basics...
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Don't try and overdo something.

*Michael*
The decoration is beautifully done
in spite of having your fingers up...
It's like a pincer. [laughing]
I think the flavour is absolutely lovely.
[Paul] I think you've created
a very good tea cake.
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Well done.

*Dan*
-You look a bit nervous.
-[chuckles] Yeah, can't see why.
[Prue] Well, it certainly does look
a bit rustic.
[Paul] You added more fruit to this,
didn't you?
Yeah.
[Paul] I'm gonna check to see
whether you managed to bake that
all the way through.
I'm not sure.
That's a big slice.
-[Prue] I'm afraid he was right.
-[laughing] Oh, my, God.
[Paul] That's raw.
The alcohol you've got in there
actually tastes quite nice.
I think your flavours are good,
I just think your baking's way out.
I knew that. Thanks for confirming.
[laughs]

Michelle, would you bring up
your birthday cake, please?
Wow. It's absolutely exquisite.
I like the detail, and it's neat.
It's tidy.
[Prue] Well, now
it's just gotta taste good.
It is a carrot cake with
orange cream cheese frosting.
[Paul] It's a great-looking carrot cake.
-I'm dribbling.
-[Noel laughs]
Prue, you've gotta stop saying that.
[all laughing]
[Prue] I mean, I'm absolutely salivating.
-I think it's wonderful.
-Oh, thank you.
The balance of spices
that you've put in is perfect.
It's nice and moist inside there,
and the design as well.
It's faultless actually.
-[Sandi] "Faultless".
-[Noel] "Faultless".
-Thank you. Thanks very much.
-[Sandi] Well done.
[applause]
"Faultless". [sighs]

*Helena*
It's very delicate. It's very charming.
Let's see what it tastes like, shall we?
The waft of chocolate is just terrific.
It is a fantastic sponge.
The depth of flavour is beautiful.
You've got coffee in there, which actually
blends beautifully with the chocolate.
I think you've done a good job
with your fairy garden.
-[Helena] Thanks.
-[Prue] Don't start.
[laughter]

*Priya*
That doesn't look like a book.
-Yeah.
-[Prue] This is just a little bit clumsy,
but I love the concept.
I've made a chocolate orange sponge
and chocolate orange buttercream.
If I hadn't just had a better one,
I would've said it was an excellent cake,
but this is slightly drier.
If you'd spent less time
with the cake in the oven
and more time getting it finished,
you probably would've been all right.

*Alice*
It's really impressive,
and it didn't collapse.
It didn't collapse, no.
[Prue] Some of it's a bit rough and ready,
but let's see what it tastes like.
Very light sponge.
-That is a beautiful cake.
-Thank you.
When you do hit the raspberry,
it is deliciously balanced.
It's a bit simplistic
but I think you've done well.

*Phil*
It's so effective.
It makes me feel quite nostalgic.
-[Noel laughs]
-I can remember 1969
-even if you boys can't.
-[laughter]
-First man on the Moon, 1969.
-Exactly, and I watched him land.
It is a good design.
However, it is leaning.
-This is sherbet, isn't it?
-Mm-hmm.
For me, it's a little too sweet.
It needs more sharpness
to balance out the sweetness.

*Henry*
I would never have thought
of that for a cake.
[Paul] The design is spectacular.
I think you've done a good job.
It's a good thing
you've got the blackberries there
because it's quite a sweet cake.
[Paul] You want that rich chocolate.
If you never had that blackberry in there,
I wouldn't like it at all.
[exhales]

*Amelia*
[Prue] You've been very restrained
about the colours.
This is a classy grown-up's version
of a child's dream.
-Did you run out of time?
-[Amelia] Yeah.
[Paul] I expected a little bit
more than that.
[Prue] But let's see what it tastes like.
It's a red velvet cake with
white chocolate ganache and raspberry jam.
[Paul] It's a pretty claggy cake.
It doesn't taste good actually.
I see what you were going for
but I think you're slightly off the mark.

*Steph*
-I love the idea that you dropped it.
-[Steph] Yeah.
[Prue] Which happens always
when you've got children on the beach.
Always. Yeah.
[Paul] That's a crumbly cake.
[Steph] It's raspberry ripple and coconut.
I think it must be a bit overbaked
'cause it's a little bit dry as a result.
Yeah, okay.
Flavours are good.
Concentrate on your baking.
Okay.

*David*
[Prue] I think it looks
absolutely amazing.
It's charming.
I think it's a fantastic-looking cake.
The egg has something in it as well.
-[Prue] Oh, it's baby snakes.
-[Paul] Ah.
Oh, wow. Brilliant and creepy.
-[laughs]
-[Noel] In a good way.
[David] Yeah.
[Prue] That's a very nice
thin layer of icing, well done.
That is a beautiful cake.
The chocolate, the citrus,
it all marries up lovely,
and to finish it off looking like that,
well done, David.
[Prue] Very, very good cake.

*Rosie*
I think it’s a little bit simplistic
for me.
-Okay.
-[Paul] A bit clumsy.
Well, I very seldom disagree with Paul,
but I love the exterior.
Tell us all about your birthday cake.
It’s a red velvet cake
with an Italian meringue buttercream.
[Paul] Nice equal layers.
The cake’s baked beautifully.
The Italian buttercream is silky smooth.
I think the interior for me works,
the exterior doesn’t.
Okay.

*Michael*
-[Prue] Oh, my goodness.
-It looks great.
I think you've ended up with a design
that any kid would be happy getting
on their birthday.
Remind me of those flavours again.
[Michael] It’s a chocolate and coffee
sponge with salted caramel buttercream.
[Paul] It’s a great-looking sponge.
I like the texture, but I think
it needed a bit more chocolate.
It’s good. Just think about your flavours.
-[Prue] I like the gold bars.
-[crunching]
-Very good.
-A couple of big kids.
-[Paul] Well done, Michael. Thank you.
-Thank you.

*Dan*
[Prue] It’s a waterfall.
-Very beautifully done.
-[Paul] It’s clever.
-It’s very clever.
-I mean, I could see kids
-going for that straightaway.
-[Prue] Yeah.
It’s lime and coconut cake
with coconut buttercream
and passion fruit curd.
Strong coconut. Where’s the passion fruit?
-It’s in the curd.
-It’s there, it’s so slight.
There’s more of it in the middle.
[laughing]
[all laugh]
-It’s not there either.
-[Michelle] Oh.
If you go further up, there’s more.
Get it?
-[laughter]
-Not really, no.
Your flavour ideas were sound,
but you’re not bringing it through.
But the design, I think,
is very, very good.

*Jamie*
-How many sponges are in there?
-Four.
[Paul] And you got salted caramel
in between each layer?
Yeah, it’s like a... [voice breaks]
Ooh, crikey.
-[laughing] That’s embarrassing.
-[Sandi] Is your voice breaking?
Finally.
[all laughing]
Yeah, it's...
So, it’s got buttercream
and caramel sauce between each layer.
-[Prue] That looks pretty good.
-Oh, I see.
-They're your dog biscuits.
-Yeah.
Actually, those biscuits are really nice.
-Are they? Oh, nice.
-[Prue] Mmm.
One mouthful is lovely.
It’s like eating a toffee.
-Yeah.
-[Prue] But a whole slice would be
overwhelmingly salted caramel.
Your cake’s overbaked.
There’s not a lot of finesse
about this cake.
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.



Well, that didn’t go well, did it?
[laughs]
I guess you don’t really know
until you’re under pressure
what it’s gonna be like.
Er... [laughs] I don’t know what to say.
Hold on, hold on. "Faultless".
Paul said he didn’t like my cake
during cake week.
Staying in this competition now
would mean everything.
I need a lifeline. Throw me a bone.
I’m just prepared for the worst,
and if it happens, it happens.
Ah. Oh, my God. I don’t wanna get filmed
with tears in my eyes.
So cringe, isn’t it?
[Sandi] Prue and Paul must now
decide who will be our first Star Baker,
and who will be leaving the tent.
That was amazing. I thought
they really came into their own.
Their personalities started to come out.
When we walked into the room,
it was just this sea
of amazing Showstoppers.
My favourite is still the first one.
-Michelle’s cake.
-[Prue] Michelle’s.
[Paul] She did okay in the Technical,
she did well in the Signature,
but this has elevated her.
So, she’s up there or thereabouts.
I think Steph deserves a mention
up there as well.
Steph’s cake was pretty good.
Third in Technical,
she did pretty well in the Signature too.
But Henry, who had done brilliantly
in the Technical,
-not so pleased?
-Henry had a good day yesterday, yeah.
-Today, he’s not done so well.
-[Paul] No, he hasn't.
People for me who are in a little bit
of trouble, I have to say Jamie.
His Signature was good,
but he was bottom of Technical.
Today, he struggled with the Showstopper.
Dan, because I was trying
to hunt down the flavour.
Although the design was pretty good.
But 13 pieces of cake.
Are you all right?
-No.
-Not quite.
[both laugh]
Well done, bakers. That is your first week
in the tent successfully completed.
Sigh of relief, I’m sure.
And I have to tell you, Paul and Prue say
the standard has been incredibly high.
So, well done.
I’ve got the fantastic job
of announcing Star Baker.
The person who is Star Baker
this week is...
Michelle.
-[Michael] Yes.
-[all cheering]
[indistinct chatter]
-Amazing. Well done.
-Thank you.
So, that leaves me with the horrible job
of sending somebody home,
and I have to say,
even after the first week,
it is incredibly difficult, but I’m afraid
one of you has to depart,
and that person is...
Dan. I'm so sorry.
-Bad call, mate.
-[chuckling] I know, mate. I know, mate.
I had a bad week.
[Sandi] Well done, Phil.
Definitely, I’ll take away
the friendships.
-[Phil] What are we gonna do without you?
-[Dan laughs]
Can’t imagine how everyone’s bonded.
It’s so strange.
-[Alice] Aw, Dan.
-[David] He’s such a beautiful man.
I’m not gonna miss
the baking under pressure.
Just gonna miss everybody in that tent.
-[Paul] Sorry, mate.
-[Dan] No, no, it’s all right.
[Paul] He’s a great baker, Dan,
but unfortunately,
it all boiled down to his Signature bake,
and it was that
that was the cause of him going.
Pick it up a bit, all right?
It was really close.
[Jamie] I thought it was gonna be me.
I’m looking forward to coming back
and almost starting again.
Convince people I can bake. [laughs]
Yeah, when you come on
and you can’t even bake a cake properly,
it doesn't look good, does it?
-[Michelle] Oh, my God.
-[Amelia] You must be so pleased.
[Michelle] I can’t get over it.
I’m so shocked.
To get Star Baker, I’m just so proud.
[crying]
[sniffles]
I don’t know what to say. I’m just happy.
-[Prue] Well done, Michelle.
-[Michelle] Thank you so much.
-[Prue] I want the recipe, please.
-[Michelle] Oh.
You know, this is the tenth anniversary,
and what a way to start.
That Showstopper was pretty well
the best cake I’ve ever eaten. [laughs]
-I’ve got something to tell you.
-[Ben] Yeah?
-I'm still in.
-[Ben] Yes!
[Michelle] And, er, Prue Leith wants
my carrot cake recipe.
[Ben laughs] Mich!
Er, and I’m Star Baker.
-[Ben] Oh, my God!
-[laughing]
[Ben] Couldn’t be prouder.
Do you know what? I knew you could do it.
I’ve had a cry as well.
[Ben] Yeah, I’m close to that as well.
[both laugh]
[Michael] Group hug. Group hug. Group hug.
Get 'em in. Get 'em in.
-[laughter]
-[Michelle] Aw.
