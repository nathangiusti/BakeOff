-Hello, Kim-Joy.
-Hi, Kim-Joy.
The ring doughnuts are very un-uniform.
That doughnut there is quite dark.
And then this one here is quite light.
So there's a little bit
of inconsistency in this.
We'll start on the ring doughnut.
The shape of its pretty good,
it's nice and round.
And as always with Kim-Joy
the decoration is very delicate...
[Paul] It is.
[Prue] ...carefully done.
[Paul] Nice texture inside.
[Prue] Hmm, nice and light.
Hmm, very nice and lemony.
[Paul] It works out as a doughnut.
It's got a nice colour,
it's got a great texture
and it's got a great flavour.
Let's have a look at one of these.
Oh wow, these are heavy,
you've got a lot of filling in there.
[Prue] This is the one
with the almond liqueur?
Yes.
[Paul] Lots of filling.
Hmm, very almondy.
It's a great flavour.
-[Prue] It really is a lovely flavour.
-Ah.
And you've got it just right
'cause quarter of a teaspoon more,
almond liqueur
and it would've been too much.
-Thank you, Kim-Joy.
-I might I come back and eat that.
You're welcome.
[laughing]

*Ruby*
Great designs on the top.
I think the decoration is very clever.
But it's got a little bit of dripping
round the ring doughnuts.
Let's have a look at these.
It's got a nice texture inside.
-Yeah.
-It's light.
[chuckles]
Because you've used the chocolate
you've got all that.
[Ruby] It's, it's very sticky.
And I'm not sure that
that's the right way to go.
-[Prue] The basic doughnut is excellent.
-Yeah.
You've just spoilt it a bit
with too sweet, too sticky topping.
Let's have a look at the, the filled.
These are under filled.
It's a bit boring.
-[Ruby] Right, okay.
-You needed lots of that filling in there.
But if you did that you really would need
a lighter icing
-because how much sugar can you get?
-So much sugar, isn't it? Yeah.
-Thank you, Ruby.
-Thank you very much.

*Rahul*
Rahul, I think the colours
are absolutely amazing.
I mean, they have such personality.
Slightly over decorated for a ring
doughnut? I dunno, probably.
-[Rahul] Probably, yeah.
-It depends what it's gonna bring
to the flavour.
It's like a doughnut you'd get
at a funeral and that makes me happy.
[laughs]
-Looks a tad on the dark side...
-[Rahul] Yes.
...a bit oily.
I think overall
your texture is a little bit tight.
I think it's under proved.
My issue is there's far too much
buttercream on there.
You do get that orange flavour
but we're tasting butter.
The last thing I wanna do when I'm eating
a doughnut is to taste butter.
But let's have a look at one of these.
One thing I do like is the height
you've got off your filled doughnuts,
they're massive.
[Rahul] Oh, it's too much filling.
[Prue] Oh my goodness. That is plenty.
That texture's much better,
lighter than the first one.
And I do like that mango filling.
It's like a little mango bomb,
'cause it is absolutely...
-[Prue] Stuffed.
-Thank you very much, Rahul.
-Thanks, Rahul.
-Thanks a lot.

Ruby, would you like to bring
your showstopper up please?
Yikes.
-Shall I help you?
-Yes, please.
Ruby, can you tell us all
about your landscape, please?
I have done a magical landscape.
You have a choux mountain,
filled with lemon crème pat
and there's also
a blueberry dipping sauce.
There is a passionfruit cake
and a unicorn.
I'm very impressed you've managed to make
the choux pastry look really rocky.
I'd like this to have been made.
I was making it out of isomalt
and I suffered a few burns at the end.
[Paul] Shall we try
this biscuit first?
[Ruby] So it's cardamom
and orange buttercream.
Very nice, crisp shortbread.
Hmm, it's got a nice flavour to that.
It's buttery, that's how it should be.
[Prue] That's very good.
[Paul] What were these mushrooms?
It did have a mint chantilly
and there was a raspberry gel
and they did look really effective
at the start, but it was just heat.
Beautiful flavour. That mint
really comes through, doesn't it?
-[Prue] Hmm, it is really delicious.
-Thank you.
[Paul] Beautiful sponge.
[Prue] Isn't it?
And the flavour with the passionfruit
goes really well together.
[Prue] Ooh, that is lovely.
It's quite bitter.
I think that was the caramel.
You've overcooked it.
[Prue] But the crème pat's good
and some nice choux pastry.
It's just a pity about the caramel.
I think that overall the idea is good,
the flavour's very tasty.
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much.

Rahul, please bring up your Showstopper.
Would you like a hand?
Yes, please. Thank you.
Rahul, tell us about your Showstopper.
So this Showstopper is my interpretation
of a rock garden.
There is a chocolate cake there,
within which is buttercream,
orange flavoured
and there is a choux mound
on the top of that.
And the other one is a lemon joconde
and then like a pond
is basically coloured orange curd
and the outside is choux pastry
filled with cream mousseline
and a little touch of cardamom.
And then all around there is a chocolate
soil and then some small little biscuits
and like a stepping stone.
Sorry, I just talk a lot.
It's quite impressive,
there's a bit of a height to it.
It does look very natural
as well, doesn't it?
It does. But I can't say
it makes my mouth water.
I think it's the sludge
puts you off a bit.
[Prue] Just remind me
what the stepping stones are made of?
Orange and ginger biscuit.
Dip it into the sludge.
-That's delicious.
-It is absolutely delicious.
That biscuit melts in the mouth.
And the biscuit is very well judged
with the curd.
[Paul] The choux buns
look hideous, don't they?
So if I open my mouth wide enough,
I will be getting praline, choux,
cardamom and some caramel on the top?
Tiny bit.
[Sandi] There we go.
You do get the cardamom and it is...
it's juicy inside.
-Is it good?
-Delicious.
It doesn't, it doesn't taste
what it looks like.
And it all comes into your taste buds
one after another and it's lovely.
[Prue] Oh, look at that.
[Rahul] This is lemon joconde and...
[Prue] Joconde.
...Italian meringue buttercream.
[Paul] That's a lovely joconde.
It's well-baked. You see how aerated
that sponge is
but the overall flavour's excellent.
Right, let's take a look
at this chocolate cake.
Oh.
If I hadn't had the joconde first,
I would say that was an exceptional cake.
But it's a good cake.
The orange
with the chocolate is delicious.
And that cake is perfectly baked.
You are so clever
at thinking things through
and your flavours are so good.
Well done. Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
[blows]

Kim-Joy, would you like to bring your
Showstopper up please?
Do you want some help?
[Kim-Joy] Yes, please?
[Noel] Okay. Have you got it?
[Prue] Wow.
So, I've done the Lost City of Atlantis.
[Paul] So we've got ginger biscuit,
we've got ginger cake and the...
[Kim-Joy] Caramel.
[Paul] Caramel.
[Kim-Joy] And the praline, yeah.
[Prue] And praline.
Well I think it's very original
and it's very colourful
and some of the work
is really quite delicate.
I'd like to have seen more height
with the cake, 'cause it's quite flat.
It's really like Jamaican
sticky ginger cake.
[Paul] The ginger cake's delicious,
it's well baked.
I do question the flavour of the orange
with that ginger.
Did you use zest in that?
Extract from the zest.
-[Paul] It's extract?
-So it's the oils.
If it was zest it would be
much more citrusy
and a bit more tang to it.
Nice caramel.
It's a nice ginger biscuit.
But the problem is, I think you would've
been wise to have done a different flavour
because the ginger cake is so gingery
that the biscuit is a bit
of a disappointment after it.
I think it's a missed opportunity.
What you've got is a biscuit,
a ginger cake and a praline,
blitzed it and put that down as sand.
I think you're missing a trick,
I think you could've done
something more with this.
It just falls a little bit flat.
Thank you, Kim-Joy.
[blows]
[Sandi] The largest crowd
that the competition has ever seen
are waiting for Prue
and Paul's final decision.
Well, we came into the Showstopper
with Kim-Joy just fractionally ahead.
[Prue] I think
she played it a little bit safe
because it wasn't nearly as much
as Ruby or Rahul did.
That style of his,
it's quite rough and ready
but because it was a landscape,
it fell into his brief.
Oh, man.
[Paul] But I loved
Ruby's passionfruit cake.
That sponge was delicious. So light,
and the biscuit was good as well.
But do we have an outright winner?
We need to look at the three challenges
together and they all did very, very well.
I've got someone
that's just stuck their neck out in front.
For me, one of the bakers
made the most consistent bakes
and another absolutely shone on design.
Well good luck to the two of you
'cause there's several
hundred people out there
with flaming torches and pitchforks,
so good luck.
[laughs]
-That's just your family, innit?
-Oh yeah, yeah.
[cheering]
[Noel] Before the winner is announced,
the finalists can at last
join their family and friends. 
Oh.
I think week one I said to Jon, I'll be
really happy if I got to week four.
Hiya, how are you doing?
And I'm here.
Hopefully, I've done enough.
-I'm very nervous, Liz.
-You're all right, sweetheart.
Whatever happens I know
I have to accept it, so.
I hope I've done enough of everything.
Have you made all that mess on your pinny?
Yeah.
I've been a bit of a, a comeback kid.
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm gonna end up crying.
No, don't cry, don't cry.
And the fact that they found it tasty
and Paul liked the cake.
That's why I bake.
I bake because people love to eat it
and it makes people happy.
This is Rahul, he's the other baker.
Hiya, nice to meet you.
I am more than happy with, with that.
[cheering]
Thank you all for coming.
Please could I ask our three wonderful
finalists to come forward
and can we have a round of applause
for Rahul, Ruby and Kim-Joy.
[applause]
I love you all.
Thank you.
Now, I wish it could be all three of you.
You've been amazing and I love you all.
But unfortunately
there can only be one winner.
And the winner is...
[exhales]
Rahul.
[cheering]
Thank you. I don't know.
I can't believe it. There you go.
-Good luck to you.
-Thank you. Thank you.
-You did it.
-You did it.
I did.
-This is for you.
-Thank you.
-Well done, mate.
-Thank you.
-Your mother would be very proud of you.
-I know. Thank you.
-What are you gonna say to her now?
-I don't know.
-Hey?
-I don't know.
Are you all right?
Yeah. I, I don't really know.
I talk so much most of the time
and I just don't know what to say now.
Hey guys, what did I tell you?
What did I tell you?
I think the amazing thing about Rahul
and why I'm so proud of him
is that he came in unconfident
but he just kept going
and he never reined in his ambition,
he always tried to do a bit more
than everybody else. And it paid off.
He's one of those characters that
you'll miss when you're not with him.
You know,
his intensity sometimes is amazing
and he's so good at what he does.
I don't think he realises
still how good he actually is.
And I think that's
what's magic about Rahul.
Rahul!
[cheering]
Look at your people, Rahul.
Yeah, thank you.
I am so, so pleased for Rahul,
but I can just tell people
I was in the final. It speaks for itself.
[cheering]
[Ruby] I've been working with
11 other insane bakers.
It has been, hands down,
the best experience of my life
and I, I would not change it at all.
I can't believe it. My God.
I really don't know how to explain.
I don't know what to say.
I don't know whether to laugh,
to cry or what. I don't know.
I just feel like I need
to talk with my mum.
[line ringing]
-Hello?
-Hello, Ma.
[speaking Bengali]
So, she's really happy.
[speaking Bengali]
Just give this to Manon for a minute,
let her hold it.
-Okay. Okay, you ready?
-What are we doing?
-We're gonna pylon.
-Oh, my God! Oh no. No, it's fine.
-Ah, come on.
-Why you gonna... I'm going to fall...
I'm going to fall down. Oh, my God!
[cheering]
Okay, okay.
[cheering]
