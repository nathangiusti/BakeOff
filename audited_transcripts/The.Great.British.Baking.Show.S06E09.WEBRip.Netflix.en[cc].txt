*Rahul*
Overall, I think they look amazing.
There’s lots of lines,
-it’s defined.
-Yeah.
That’s the perfect hump for this.
What do you think of these, Prue?
[Prue] When you see the two together
you think obviously
those have risen better.
Yeah. Yeah. It’s the same batter.
It’s just the raspberries.
[Prue] Yes.
-Okay.
-That’s very good.
The raspberry perfectly balances
the white chocolate.
[Paul] It has affected the overall look
but to counter that you’ve managed
to put a raspberry in
that creates a great amount of flavour.
Okay, well, let’s try the orange one
with the chocolate.
Yes. It has a little bit of orange curd
in the middle.
-I don't know... some of...
-[Prue] Look at that.
[Paul] I can see that,
right in the middle.
That’s absolutely delicious.
Thank you.
[Paul] I mean, really good.
You’ve managed to put the feathering on.
The hazelnut really
marries well with it as well.
That’s a great madeleine.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] That is a real little triumph.
-Well, triumphant.
-Very good.
-Thank you, Rahul.
-Thank you.
Rahul? Rahul?
Stop grimacing. Smile.
Oh, crap.

*Ruby*
-Hello, Ruby.
-Hello.
-Hey, Rubes.
-Hello, Rube.
They’re a little bit of a mess.
There’s a disaster on both of them.
Looks like it’s been fried almost.
Too much butter
on the inside of your tray.
-Not much of a hump.
-Yeah.
It’s got almost the texture
of a slightly under baked polenta cake.
-It’s heavy.
-Right.
I think your flavour's fantastic.
You have got orange.
-You have got the stem ginger.
-Yeah.
It’s a shame it doesn’t look great
but the flavour of it's very good.
This is the one with the raspberry, in it?
Yeah.
Same thing. Bit sad.
Flavour’s amazing though.
-Not your best.
-No.
Flavour’s good.
[Ruby] I mean, I’ll take that.
If I’m being honest.
I’m gonna take that as a win.

*Briony*
I like your rather zany icing
but we were looking for perfection.
The hump’s actually not bad.
It could be a little bit bigger
but it’s not bad.
That looks like nice sponge, doesn't it?
Hmm.
I’m not getting the lime.
No? Okay. Just the mint?
Hmm. Struggling with the mint as well.
Ah.
If you said that was vanilla,
I’d believe you.
Oh, okay.
-But espresso martini, surely,
-Surely. Hopefully.
that’s gonna be the one. Hmm?
[Prue] Because this will be stronger?
[Briony] Yes.
-Hmm, I love the coffee bean flavour.
-Thank you.
It’s just delicious.
That sort of crunchy, strong coffee.
[Paul] It’s a shame about the colour.
Think it is a little bit too dark.
-[Briony] Yeah.
-I think the flavour’s fantastic.
-Lovely.
-Oh, good. Okay, thank you.

*Kim-Joy*
As I expected, they’re beautifully iced
and they’re very neat
and they’re very uniform.
But I can see immediately that
you’ve got too much
baking powder in there.
-You’ve got a big bump at the back.
-[Kim-Joy] That’s, that’s...
You see the way they’re almost...
it’s pregnant.
I’m not getting a massive amount
of flavour in that one.
You certainly get the citrus in the icing.
You don't get any flavour
from the madeleine itself.
It’s almost not enough sweetness
and not enough lemon.
[Paul] Hmm. Be fascinating to see
what the other one’s like.
[Kim-Joy] And that’s the orange one.
[Sandi] You can actually smell the orange.
-The flavour’s much better.
-Okay.
Beautiful orange in the sponge.
The orange icing compliments each other.
These ones I love.
[Paul] Yeah. Orange is a big hit.
-So it’s just half good.
-Thank you.
Thank you. [laughs]

*Kim-Joy*
The whole thing about French pâtisserie
is about how delicate they are,
how small they are.
These are all quite chunky
and in fact, I look round,
and there’s a lot of big stuff here
and I wouldn't necessarily
agree with the size.
You can almost half every one of these.
It's all about delicacy.
It’s about punching a big flavour
in a small exquisite cake.
Okay, let’s start with the mille-feuille.
A dry top on mille-feuille?
I know. I ran out of time. I’m so sorry.
It looks very dull.
I know.
You could have cooked it a little longer.
If you do a mille-feuille the pastry
has to be totally crisp.
The good news, Kim-Joy, is that
the flavour is absolutely wonderful.
Ah.
[Paul] And these,
I don't like the look of them.
They’re all broken up.
What you should have done
is chosen the Italian meringue
and then blowtorched it.
Pastry’s lovely and I love the filling.
Okay, let’s move onto the choux.
They don't look too bad.
Maybe a little bit burnt in places.
Yeah, it’s caught a little bit.
[Prue] It’s a little bit dark, isn’t it?
Wow, that’s a terrible way to kill a nun.
[all laughing]
One of the real difficulties
with choux pastry
is filling it properly
and that’s properly filled.
It has got a nice orange flavour.
It is quite tart and I like that.
But I don't agree
with the craquelin though.
Problem is when you bake with craquelin
is when you’re baking it,
it colours quicker
than the actual choux itself
and so you bring it out the oven
thinking it’s ready
and that’s not necessarily the case.
I think overall the idea
was there on all of them
but I think the execution hasn't been
as good as it could have been.
No.

*Ruby*
Well, I must say they are very pretty
and beautifully decorated,
I would say with the exception
of the Saint-Honorés.
I think the caramel is much too thick.
I love the idea but again
they’re just too big
-and these are huge.
-Okay. Yeah.
But, um, it’s all down to the bake now
and flavour.
[Prue] The puff pastry looks
really nicely baked
and I’m hoping that it will be
not soft in the middle.
These layers are very good.
They’re very well baked.
There is not a wet bit in there at all.
It’s just dry and it’s flaking.
That’s how it should be.
-[Prue] Beautiful.
-Thank you.
[Prue] Really good.
I love the mint.
-The mint is just delicious.
-It’s delicate, isn’t it?
Delicious.
-Okay.
-Okay.
[Prue] Next one.
What is the pastry underneath?
It’s a shortbread.
[Prue] Flavour’s delicious.
It is clever.
The choux buns are baked well.
The flavour in there is pretty good.
[Prue] And the chocolate filling’s lovely.
Your base is fantastic,
‘cause that is just crispy
all the way through.
I think you’ve done a good job with that.
Pipe work’s good,
I think the choice of meringue is good
but I don't like fruit that’s unglazed.
-[Ruby] Okay.
-Any fruit that’s unglazed looks
unfinished.
That lemon curd is so powerful
and so strong.
-It’s verbena. It’s that concentrate.
-[Ruby] Yeah.
It’s a strong flavour.
If you'd had maybe a raspberry coulis
that would have been enough
because the pastry’s baked really well.

*Briony*
This pastry looks a little bit thick.
You know, we’re looking for delicacy
and this is massive.
I mean, this is colossal.
It just looks a bit clumsy, doesn't it?
[Briony] Yeah. No, I agree.
Oh, dear the mousse has run.
Oh, dear. Yeah.
Potent flavours. The flavours are okay.
Your tart case is quite chewy.
Oh, right, okay.
-And...
-Too thick.
[Paul] These look okay.
If they were smaller,
they would be really nice.
I could see that in a Parisian shop.
-[Briony] I’m sorry about...
-What are these filled with?
I didn’t have time to fill them.
I’m really sorry.
So this is just plain pastry with...
What’s this?
Yeah. That’s lemon crème pat.
Quite a lot of salt in the pastry.
Oh, really?
[Paul] Yeah, it’s very salty.
I probably put two teaspoons of salt in
instead of sugar the way today went.
[laughing]
[Paul] And then the mille-feuille,
your pastry is raw.
Yes. Yes.
-It is very raw.
-Yeah.
Coffee crème pat, it's got a nice flavour
but you’ve cooked it too much.
-Oh, okay.
-[Prue] I like those flavours,
with the caramel particularly it’s nice
but, um, it’s actually also quite salty.
Maybe you were thinking salted caramel.
[Paul] Did you mix
your salt and sugar up today?
I don't know, maybe I did. Sorry.
Briony, don't say sorry to us.
I mean, it’s to you you have to say sorry
-‘cause you can do much better than this.
-I know I can.
And this was not the time to get it wrong.

*Rahul*
You can’t put that in a shop
when it’s not finished.
To glaze them at the end of this
would have taken you,
-minute? If that. If that.
-[Rahul] Yeah.
And after five hours, you couldn't do it.
That is an absolutely classic
French tartlet without the glaze.
I think the flavours are good.
I think your base is a little bit thick.
Okay, we’ll try the éclair.
They’re probably not completely full.
I think the flavour’s lovely.
That has got a bit of salt in it too
but not too much.
Pastry’s a little soft
but I think it’s about right.
But the top isn’t very neat.
-[Rahul] No.
-Caramel’s all over the place.
I don't like the flavours. It’s boring.
It really is boring.
I wouldn't go as far as to say it’s boring
but it’s certainly not the most exciting
éclair I’ve ever eaten.
[Paul] This one here is the one
that worries me the most.
Yeah.
[Paul] Oh, great flavour.
Wow.
I didn't think I was gonna
like that at all.
It’s delicious.
Really good.
It looks hideous but it tastes amazing.
Thank you.
[Paul] With that cream inside
and the blueberries
and with that bite coming from the curd
is just stunning, isn’t it?
-Thank you, Rahul.
-[Prue] Hmm. Thank you, Rahul.

Okay, so semi-final.
Parisian window.
Is this what you imagined?
[Paul] Some of them were nearly there,
they had all the elements.
But some of them were way off the mark.
Rahul hasn't had a particularly good day.
All right, the pastry tastes all right
but it looks terrible.
I don't know what’s happened to him
because he’s definitely gone
a bit backwards.
Let’s talk about Briony for a minute.
[Prue] I was really surprised 
because Briony knew that today was the day
she had to pull out all the stops
and usually that’s the sort of challenge
that makes her do her best stuff.
It doesn’t help if your salt
and your sugar get confused.
I mean, I’m not a baker
but I’m gonna guess...
I think that’s exactly what happened.
I think Ruby overall has done well.
I love the idea of the choux,
the, the Saint-Honorés
with the biscuit base
‘cause actually that worked.
It had fabulous flavours
and that pastry was beautiful
but I think it looks awful.
I think, uh, the idea of the religieuses,
which Kim-Joy did was pretty good.
The flavours were there.
I just... on a personal opinion,
I didn't like the craquelin on the top.
But if I had to choose
one of all of these things to eat...
Yeah, which one?
It’s probably the one
that looks the worst,
which is Rahul’s mille-feuille.
It was sensational flavour.
-Shall I go for it? Is it good?
-Yeah, it’s delicious.
Go on.
You can’t get it into your mouth.
I mean, they’re big for Sandi.
These are like double-decker buses.
-Yeah.
-That’s the biggest thing I’ve ever eaten.
You won’t have to eat again now
until next week.
No. No. That’s it.
Well done, my lovely bakers,
getting through the semi-final.
I’ve got the good job
this week of announcing
the Star Baker.
The person who is this week’s Star Baker
and who will definitely
be going through to the final is...
Ruby.
-I knew it.
-[Ruby] Oh, my God.
On a roll, baby girl. On a roll.
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.
So my job now
is to be completely professional
and not cry at all.
Uh, it’s tricky because, uh,
we are so fond
of all of you and the person
who is going home
has been a complete force of nature
in this tent.
And I’m afraid the person who is...
...not going through to the final...
...is Briony.
-It’s okay. It’s okay.
-I’m so sorry.
It’s okay. It’s okay.
That was the right decision.
Oh, I’m so sorry my friend. I’m so sorry.
It’s okay. Thank you for you kind words.
It’s okay.
[voice breaking] Sad to not be
going through to the final
but so happy with how far I’ve come.
Like, my God, in so many ways.
What an experience.
Oh, my God, my musketeer.
Nobody wanted to see Briony go
because she has been
so good at coming back
when things have gone wrong.
Yeah, I still love baking.
I love baking more than ever.
Knowing that I can do
more than I ever thought I could.
I don't often say that I’m proud of myself
but I am. I’m proud of myself.
[Rahul] Can’t believe that.
The person who never baked a single cake
till his 29th birthday is a finalist.
-[Briony] Well done, guys. Come here.
-Oh, guys.
I actually think there’s gonna be
a fantastic final next week.
We’ve got three great bakers. 
Each one of them
have this very artistic flair. 
If they bring their A game,
that is gonna be the best final ever,
I promise you.
I bet you’re shocked. You’re shocked.
You can tell me.
I was hoping Ruby would get Star Baker
‘cause then we’ve all got two Star Bakers.
So it must be, like,
the most evenly balanced final ever.
Right?
