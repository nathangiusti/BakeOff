*Henry*
-[Prue] The black and white works.
-[Henry] Yeah.
It's very dramatic and nice.
-[Prue] You can taste the pesto.
-Yeah.
[Prue] In fact, it's difficult
to taste anything else.
It's not bad, the bread.
It's a little bit bland.
I don't like the flavour,
and I don't know
how you've managed to do that
'cause you've got all the things in there
which should taste amazing.

*Steph*
[Paul] It's quite attractive.
[Prue] And the colour is lovely.
It's bone dry.
If you'd brought that out
five, ten minutes earlier,
you'd have been laughing.
-The pesto comes through.
-[Prue] It's beautifully shaped.
-And it's overbaked.

*Rosie*
-[Paul] Yeah.
-[Prue] I think that's heaven.
-[sighs]
[Prue] I like that it's soft.
I like the flavour.
-I could eat a lot of it.
-Thank you.
[Paul] Your flavours are fantastic.
Thank you very much indeed. Thank you.

*Alice*
It's quite attractive.
It's quite dry.
You've just overbaked it slightly.
-But the flavours, I like.
-It is delicious.
Thank you.

*Amelia*
[Paul] They're a bit irregular in sizes.
That one's massive, that one's minute.
It does look a bit thrown together,
but it may taste fantastic.
I hope it does.
Certainly hearty... chorizo.
[coughing]
-Bit of chilli there.
-[Prue coughs] Yeah.
Uh-oh. [chuckles]
That was not my intention.
-It's delicious--
-Got a bit of a kick to it.
What you need is
to chop everything up much smaller.
That's the problem.
You've got so much going on.
[Prue] She's big on flavour.

*David*
[Paul] Interesting texture.
It's a bit too doughy for me,
but who doesn't like
cinnamon and sugar in spades.
[Paul] The dried fruit,
you need to put more in.
Your actual bake, I think, is perfect.

*Helena*
That ain't no tear-and-share.
The problem is... it's covered.
-Right. Well, yeah, you'll get messy.
-[chuckles]
And the rolls are proved individually.
It is exactly like
an American cinnamon roll, a good one.
You slightly overbaked it.
I was scared
of you telling me that it was raw.
Damn it, Paul! It's your fault.

*Michelle*
-It's a bit messy.
-Rustic. I'd go with that. [chuckles]
It's wonderfully cheesy.
I like the texture.
That's one. Was that the other one?
[Michelle] That's black garlic
and truffle oil.
[Prue] Really nice.
The blend of the two are good.
You baked them well.
You've come up with some nice ideas.

*Phil*
[Prue] It looks very tempting.
-Like homemade bread you'd want to eat.
-[Phil] Mm-hmm.
[crunches]
[Prue] Hmm.
[Paul] The flavours you achieved
are beautiful.
-Thank you.
-Nice flavours.
Nice loaf that.

*Priya*
It's very cheesy.
You've got loads of flavour
and texture in there.
A beautifully baked dough.
Slightly overproved,
but otherwise, it tastes lovely.
Well done.

*Michael*
I love the effect of that.
-Very clever.
-[Prue] Very pretty.
-Brilliant.
-[Paul] Nice bake on the other side.
I like the coconut.
The coconut works well with it.
The kick from the chilli's enough.
I just love the red around there.
-[Helena gasping]
-Oh.
-[applause]
-[Michael laughing]
[exclaims]
I really like that, and I tell you why,
it's because I've never had
anything like it.
-Thank you.
-[Paul] That's why it's special.

*Rosie*
[Sandi] Rosie, would you like
to bring up your Showstopper?
I think the scoring is very good.
What a fantastic effect
you've managed to get.
Likewise with the giraffe.
-Very clever.
-[Prue] And it's very original.
And I like the different way
that you've scored them all.
Different depths, so that you've got
thicker lines and thinner lines.
It's really clever.
It's a nice grey loaf.
-I've never had grey bread before.
-[laughing]
Could've done with a bit more salt.
Don't be afraid to add a bit more flavour.
I think this is delicious.
[Paul] They're baked beautifully.
They look great. Very artistic.
-And lots of perfect scoring.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done.
-[Paul] Thank you.

*Alice*
I love the definition in that one.
It's a nice-looking loaf.
[Prue] This one's really clever.
I mean, that's a pretty good,
recognisable globe.
That's very nice. The nuts and the seeds
give it a lovely flavour, too.
It could do with a bit more seasoning.
[Paul] Hm, it's a bit bland,
but the cuts are very good.
It's a nice-looking loaf.
Overall, you haven't done too bad.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Thanks. Well done.

*David*
They are obviously African masks.
But this one, which is sort of broken,
it looks brilliant.
It looks like some artistic rendering
of a scary mask.
But that wasn't the challenge,
the challenge was to do
really good scoring.
-It's barely done.
-Mm-hmm.
[Paul] The idea was sound enough.
Disappointed.
And there's not enough salt in it.
All style and no substance.
-Cool, thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you very much.

*Helena*
The whole thing is so imaginative
and so wonderful.
It's fantastic.
[Paul] You've lost a lot of definition
in the cuts with these.
I think that's because
I baked them in a pot.
[Paul] Could've left them
in the pot a little bit longer.
-It's a dense old loaf, that.
-[Prue] And quite heavy.
The only flavour you get is from
the crust where it's caramelised,
and the cuts are not good enough.
You know,
I wanted more emphasis on the cuts.

*Henry*
Got a nice bit of, erm...
Little bit of paper?
It's very typical fougasse, quite tough.
It's got great flavour.
But I have seen more decorative fougasses.
Fougasse is not really conducive
for heavy scoring.
Is it quite soft?
[Prue] That means more in the oven.
[Henry] Yes.
[Paul] More proving,
more time in the oven.
Nice flavour.
[Paul] The flavour's good.
The cuts are a bit ripped
rather than slashed through.
-It's a shame.
-Yeah.
-Thank you, Henry.
-Thank you.

*Steph*
It's highly effective.
It hasn't blown anywhere.
You could've left it in longer.
I was scared of that after yesterday.
The rosemary flavouring is just right.
You've well-baked
and well-proved your loaf.
Your structure's beautiful inside.
Love the cuts. Love the design.
-It's excellent, Steph.
-Oh, bless you.
-[Paul] Yeah, well done. That's very good.
-Thank you.

*Priya*
[Paul] You can see the cuts,
but you want to see
more definition in there.
I think you could've done more scoring
and less painting.
[Paul] Great structure inside.
You could've been more potent
with the flavours,
and the cuts a bit deeper.
-But nevertheless, two nice loaves.
-Okay.

*Phil*
It's very ingenious.
The scoring on the laurel leaves
around the edge is beautiful.
[Paul] That's beautifully baked.
-[Prue] Mm.
-[Paul] Wow, it's light.
It's all baked well and you have got
some scoring going on.
Not a huge amount.
But you've made up for it
because the bread is so delicious.
Thank you.

*Michelle*
[Prue] It's really effective.
Some of your scoring is really neat
and beautiful.
I quite like the way
you've coloured the bigger scores.
You've lost some of the definition
in this.
[inaudible]
[Paul] It's quite smooth.
You expect these to be slightly risen up.
[Michelle] Mm-hmm.
I like the flavour.
I would've liked it a bit crustier.
I quite like the crust.
It goes all the way around about the same.
[Prue] Let's try the hedgehog.
-So, this is rye, is it?
-[Michelle] Yeah.
-Stodgy.
-[Paul] Quite dense.
I mean, rye is always going to be.
-However, they taste delicious.
-[Paul] Thank you.

*Amelia*
It does look a bit clumsy, your scoring.
There's no finesse to it.
Love the design.
The design's very good,
but the baking is terrible.
Oh, dear.
Why did you bring them out so early?
See this one here, how soft they've gone?
They've always been quite soft
when I've practiced them.
-[Paul] Is there any flavour in this?
-That one's plain.
Are you sure this is underbaked?
[Paul] It needs more colour.
How long was it in there for?
-Twenty-five, half an hour?
-Yeah, twenty-five minutes tops.
Wow, a loaf that big.
It's 40 minutes before you start.
There's not much flavour to any of these.
Nothing.
You need to put flavours with them.
Put big, punchy flavours in there.

*Michael*
[Prue] This one's had
a bit of a burst out, hasn't it?
It's burst quite badly there.
Cut it slightly deeper
and it blew the whole thing out.
This one looks much nicer.
I think, overall, the actual image
of what you're trying to do is amazing.
The red in there looks attractive.
You painted that in.
It looks really nice.
-[Prue] Looks good.
-[Paul] Nice loaf.
The flavour is nice.
Design's good. The bake's all right.
I like it, even though
you've blown out there.
[exhales heavily]


Let's start with the upbeat stuff.
Steph did very well.
Great display.
The scoring on everything was fantastic.
-[Sandi] Michael?
-[Paul] Michael's done well.
He managed to colour the inside,
but he had definition there.
-You could see there were flames.
-He did really well.
Who's at the bottom?
Who are we worrying about?
Henry.
Henry. You can't discount it,
even though he won
the Technical Challenge.
-Amelia.
-I think Amelia's in trouble.
I think you can put
Alice in there as well.
Still the possibility
two people will go home?
I think so.
[Noel] Hello, bakers.
I've got the great job this week
of announcing the person
who's won Star Baker.
The person who's won Star Baker
this week is...
Michael.
[clapping]
[Noel laughing]
I have the horrible job
of sending somebody home.
It gets tougher and tougher each week.
I'm afraid the person
who is leaving us is...
-Amelia.
-I knew it.
-[Sandi] I'm so sorry.
-I knew it.
[Amelia] I'm absolutely gutted.
I've always, always said,
bread week for me will be about survival,
and I just didn't survive.
[Paul] Amelia's a decent baker,
it showed in her Showstopper.
The idea was sound enough
but it wasn't executed well.
She struggled in the Signature
and she was low down in the Technical.
-[Phil] I'm sorry to see you go.
-Thank you.
I'm sorry it wasn't a good Showstopper.
I did try.
Bread can take a hike.
I live to fight another day. Phew.
-[Paul] That was good.
-Thank you very much.
I'm a little overwhelmed.
[Phil] Good man. Well done.
Maybe I will try making bread again.
Maybe I'll do it a couple more times.
But I'll never score it again. [chuckles]
[Paul] Overall, Michael had a great week.
He did well in the Technical,
and the Showstopper he did really well.
He deserved Star Baker.
I can go home now. Tick, done.
Bake-Off, sorted. Finished. [chuckles]
