*David*
-Hello, David.
-Hi.
[exhales]
I think it's quite effective.
[Prue] It's a really good shine.
And the leaves actually look
quite nice on it as well.
[gasps] Can't wait, come on.
-Give us a bite.
-[Paul] Let's have a look.
[Prue] Look at that.
[Paul] It looks very good inside.
-You can smell the Armagnac, can't you?
-[David chuckling]
Mmm.
That Armagnac,
you wouldn't miss it, David.
-[Prue chuckles]
-[Sandi] Is there enough?
[chuckles] There's slightly
more than enough.
[Paul] I think when you do hit a prune,
it is delicious.
I think all your textures are beautiful,
but all you're getting is alcohol.
[Prue] It is so boozy
that you can only eat
a tiny little bit of it.
So a bit of ice cream or something?
-Would that work?
-[Prue] Hmm.
-Chocolate ice cream, probably.
-[all laughing]
[Paul] Thank you very much.
-[David] Thanks, guys.
-Thanks, David.

*Alice*
First impression, it's a bit wobbly.
-[Alice] Hmm.
-[Prue] And it's a bit clumsy.
[Paul] I like the dripping effect.
I think it looks quite nice
and there is a bit of a shine there.
There's a lot going on, on the top.
You're usually so delicate.
Okay.
-But it may taste fantastic.
-[Alice chuckles]
[Paul] Let's see, shall we?
[Prue] The knife's going in
beautifully there.
Wow.
The texture of the cake's lovely,
isn't it?
Mm.
Very light.
[Paul] You didn't have, erm,
real chocolate in this,
-did you?
-No.
Cocoa.
-Do you think it could be more chocolatey?
-Yeah.
-I'm lacking the chocolate, actually.
-Okay.
Because you've got maple,
because you've got a little bit of ginger,
because you've got pear,
and then you put cocoa in there,
it's a great cake.
-[Alice] Yeah.
-But is it a great chocolate cake?
I think it's delicious.
I think it is a really good balance
between chocolate and pear and ginger.
My main problem with it
is actually the way it looks.
-Yeah.
-Not the way it tastes.
-Thank you, Alice.
-Thank you very much.

*Steph*
[Prue] It's very '70s.
It's a sort of old-fashioned cake.
But that's what you were doing
and you've done it beautifully.
[Paul] It's very elegant,
but let's have a look inside, shall we?
Three pretty distinctive layers in there.
[Prue] Yeah. Cherry jam looks beautiful.
That's a black forest gateau.
[Paul] You've certainly got
the chocolate there.
And the cherries and the cream
work well together.
There's a good balance.
It's very crumbly, that cake.
I think it is slightly overbaked,
but the flavour of the chocolate
is delicious.
It's a very nice cake, Steph.
-Okay, thanks.
-[Paul] Very good.
-Thank you.
-[Steph] Thanks, guys.


Alice, please bring up your showstopper.
Not as strong as I thought I was.
[chuckles nervously]
I think that's exceptional.
Quite an impressive illusion.
Yeah. The scotch eggs, you do believe
that that's egg.
That's amazing. The only thing that fail
a little on the illusion side
are the ice creams.
They're very good.
They just don't look totally convincing.
[Paul] Let's have a look at the buns.
I don't think it really works
'cause blueberries
don't have much flavour,
but they do look absolutely perfect.
-[Paul] And these are?
-[Alice] Carrot cake scotch eggs.
So, the egg is a lemon cream cheese
and then a lemon curd yolk.
-Lemon comes through a little bit.
-Hmm.
-Good carrot cake there.
-Mmm.
[Prue] I think that's exceptional.
The illusion works,
it's funny and it tastes nice.
[Paul] And these are the little macarons?
[Prue] You only got one strawberry-shaped.
I did have a few issues
with the macarons. [chuckles]
[Prue chuckles]
That's really strong flavour,
really fresh fruit.
[Paul] Right, what is this?
It's orange and cardamom.
-Love that. A lot of zest coming off that.
-Mmm.
A lot of zing. It's a good texture as well
for an enriched dough.
Very clever,
and I do like the taste of them.
Thank you very much, Alice.
That's a pretty good effort.
-Well done.
-Thank you very much. Thank you.
David, please bring up your showstopper.
I think it looks amazing.
Stunning. The basket is great.
It's even got mine
and Prue's initials on it.
The fig rolls have worked really well
as sausage rolls.
And that cheese looks incredible.
-So, what shall we start with? The peach?
-[Prue] Yeah, let's start with the peach.
Oh, that looks lovely.
I like. That's really clever.
And the saffron does work well.
-[David] Yes!
-And it took the final to get there.
The texture's excellent as well,
and the fruit just sets it off
with a little bit of zing as well.
I think the flavours are very interesting.
But I think they're too chewy.
[Paul] Shall we try your fig rolls,
or sausage rolls?
Mmm. Very nice.
-That's very good as well.
-[Prue] And they look fantastic.
[Paul] Yeah, they do.
The texture's so soft on the mouth
with the fondant and with the buttercream
as well all together.
-It is really delicious.
-[Prue] It's really delicious.
You've come up with something
that is very very clever,
and you've gone to the extra bit
of making the biscuit base
and the fondant, the tablecloth,
the chutney.
And the whole thing together
is exceptional.
Bravo.
Thank you.
Nailed it.
Phew.
Steph, would you like to bring up
your showstopper, please?
Apart from the basket having had
a few problems,
I like the look of the burger.
And I would definitely think
that was made of bread.
I think there's obviously been
a few issues today.
The bun topping is not right.
And the strawberries, you need to get
the glisten on the top of them.
The bun I like,
and that looks pretty good.
Nice hot cross bun.
Delicious. Love the spice.
[Paul] Need to prove a little bit more.
-It's a little bit tight inside.
-[Steph] Hmm.
[Prue] Those are not round enough
for strawberries. They're a bit flat.
[smack lips] My, you've got a kick
to that Chantilly, haven't you?
[Prue] What's in there?
-[Steph] Cherry liqueur.
-It's a little bit overwhelming.
Yeah.
-[Noel whispers] Wow.
-[Paul laughing]
[Prue] That is really good.
-[Sandi] That's great.
-[Paul] Clever.
[Prue] Very clever.
It's not much flavour to that.
-Okay.
-[Paul] Could've done with more lemon.
It's a little bit overbaked as well.
Never mind, Steph.
Thank you very much indeed.


This is difficult for us
'cause we just get to look at the cakes,
we don't taste them.
If there was one that you particularly
loved the taste of, which one would it be?
I liked Alice's. And I liked David's.
I'm not sure what happened to Steph today
because there are some issues
in every single element.
-She'll be kicking herself.
-It was heartbreaking, really, wasn't it?
[Prue] It was heartbreaking.
I think ultimately what we're looking at,
it's between Alice and David.
-So, Alice has had star baker twice.
-[Paul] Yeah.
David, not at all.
I think the thing is, with David,
they always look good,
but it's whether it matches up
with flavour and textures,
and often it didn't,
but in the final it has.
-Cool.
-But I'm going to remind you
that his signature was not your favourite.
If you're looking overall,
Alice has been very steady
-in every single challenge.
-[Prue] Yeah.
-She has.
-The Scotch egg is astonishing.
[Paul] The look of it throws you
totally when you eat it.
Well, I think you two
have still got things to discuss,
so while you do that,
can I have a sausage roll, please?
-Yeah, of course, yeah.
-[Noel chuckles]
-[Sandi] Thanks.
-You do know it's a fig roll, don't you?
-Oh, I've changed my mind.
-Ah.
[all cheering and applauding]
-Oh, my goodness, there's loads of people!
-[Steph] Oh, my God!
[Sandi] Before the winner
of the Great British Baking Show 2019
is announced...
Hey, bakers!
...the bakers can at last
join their family and friends.
You made it! Oh, my God!
[Alice] I'm ecstatic that all my friends
and family are here.
-Love you.
-[Alice chuckles]
So, I can relax now. [chuckles]
[Alice] I was so scared
that you weren't gonna come.
-I know. Wouldn't miss it for the world.
-[Alice laughs] I know.
I've done 30 bakes in the Bake Off tent,
and the last one, it went well,
so, really relieved and happy.
Oh, my darling, come here.
[Steph] I'm proud of myself.
I really have gone above and beyond
anything I could've imagined. [sniffles]
I saved the worst till last.
[indistinct chatter]
Maybe ten weeks was just one too many.
[Nik] This looks amazing.
[David] I think in other weeks
when I've done well,
I've never felt like I've done the best.
So, I feel more nervous
than I have in any other week.
[Jamie] You've glazed
your fig rolls, mate.
[all laughing]
I'll be happy no matter what,
I would just like to be ecstatic.
[crowd cheering and applauding]
Would the finalists please step forward.
[crowd cheering and applauding]
Thank you so much to all of you
for coming to support
this wonderful event.
And how lovely to see all the bakers
returned to the tent.
I am delighted to tell you,
after ten weeks of intense competition,
the winner is...
David.
[crowd cheering loudly]
[David laughing]
[indistinct chatter]
-[Alice] You deserve it.
-Oh, my goodness.
[Paul and David laughing]
[Paul] Well done, mate.
-You smashed it.
-[David sighs]
-You smashed it.
-Just at the right time.
-Yeah, don't smash that, though.
-[David laughs] Thank you.
-Oh.
-Well done, darling.
Thank you very much.
-So well done!
-Whoa!
-Thank you. Thank you.
-[Sandi] Congratulations.
[laughs] I got it.
I got it.
[indistinct chatter]
[Sandi] So close. It was so close.
[exhales]
-[Michael] Yes! You won it!
-[David laughs]
It wasn't even in my mind
that I could win this.
So proud of you.
Like, week-on-week,
other people were stronger,
I was always the underdog,
but managing to get through.
Just getting to the final
was a win for me.
So this is just unreal.
-[Noel] Nailed it, in the final.
-[David sighs]
Yeah, just saved the best till last,
that's all I had.
David came as probably the underdog
into the final,
knowing that twice Alice has won,
four times Steph has won,
and he has come from nothing,
and then won the whole thing.
I mean, it's priceless.
Absolutely priceless.
He should be very proud of himself.
I think he's done an amazing job.
[photographer] Lovely!
Thank you very much.
-Cool.
-[Paul] Well, done, David.
-Whoa. Thank you very much.
-[Paul] What are you going to do now?
-[laughs] I don't know.
-[Paul laughs]
David is an extraordinary baker.
I am so full of admiration for him,
because right from the beginning,
he has never lost his temper,
he is always very neat and very organised.
It was really a question
of the tortoise catching the hare
because he just steadily went on
and... and won.
-Oh, my goodness!
-[David chuckles]
You're amazing. We're so proud of you.
[David sighs] You can take these, Mum.
You can have these.
David just... He blew us out of the water.
The best baker won,
and I'm feeling great.
-You did so well. I'm so proud.
-I am so happy.
I am really proud of myself, and I can
really leave with my head held high.
It's just the best feeling.
Well done, Steph.
If you were gonna have a bad day,
how better to make it all go away.
I've made some amazing,
lifelong friends.
Just the most incredible experience ever.
Ah. It feels so good.
It's been weeks and weeks of intensity,
and fatigue, and then intensity.
And to finish it with this, I mean,
it's the best feeling in the world.
-Well done, David.
-[David laughs]
Thank you.
You got the bread, honey.
-[David] I got the bread.
-[Nik laughs]
I'm so proud of you.
