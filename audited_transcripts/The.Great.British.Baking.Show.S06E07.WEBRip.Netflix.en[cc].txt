[Manon] So we have the summer tartlet,
which is ratatouille
and then we have the winter tartlet,
which is a vegan béchamel
with chestnut mushrooms and chestnuts.
[Paul] It does look very attractive.
Pastry looks nice and even.
It’s well baked all the way through.
It’s nice.
Cuts beautifully through.
-It’s very mild...
-[Manon] Hmm-mm, yeah.
but it is very delicious.
[Paul] Have you got coconut in there?
Hmm-mm. In the pastry.
Coconut really works, doesn't it?
-[Prue] That is excellent.
-[Paul] A very good pastry.
-I’m glad.
-[Paul] Okay.
[Paul] Let’s look at this ratatouille one.
[Manon] Yes.
Mm. It certainly tastes like
the south of France.
Pastry’s a bit hard
but it’s good and it’s holding its shape.
Overall, I think you’ve done
a very decent job.
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

*Ruby*
[Paul] Consistent in colour.
Shapes are identical,
which is a good start.
Yeah.
[Prue] How did you get on
with the cheese mixture,
-‘cause you put in that nutritional yeast?
-Yes.
It tasted good.
Fingers crossed it comes across well.
Well, I can taste the broccoli
and I can taste the, um,
broccoli.
[laughs]
-Bit underwhelmed actually.
-Right, okay.
[Paul] I was expecting it to have
more flavour in there.
-Right, okay.
-I mean, the pastry’s nice and thin.
-[Ruby] Yeah.
-It’s crisp
but the only thing you can really taste
is the broccoli and a bit of chilli...
-Okay.
-...at the back of your throat.
-Let’s have a go at the other one.
-Okay.
[Paul] One thing that winds me up,
green on the top of tomato.
I just thought it looked better, you know.
[Prue] It looks really nice
without them anyway.
Yeah.
Hmm. Quite sweet.
And chilli.
Just a little bit.
[laughs] I think a bit more
than a little bit.
I honestly... I only put in just a touch.
I was, like,
I don't want to go in too much.
[Paul] I think overall I get the sage.
-Yeah.
-I get that bit of heat and then
-nothing much else.
-Okay.
That’s fine.

*Rahul*
[Rahul] This one is like a pesto.
It’s just garlic, coriander leaf,
cashew nut and poppy seed paste.
Lovely pastry. Very good flavours.
[Paul] I wouldn't have put
that much filling in.
Maybe even half
that would have been plenty.
Okay, let’s try this one now shall we?
[Ruby] This one is a ghugni chaat,
which is chickpea curry
and underneath there is a plum chutney
and caramelised onions.
[Prue] You can see the pastry is crumbly
but it’s holding together,
which is really the difficult thing.
[Rahul] Thank you.
Fantastic.
Poetry.
Thank you.
-[Noel] "Poetry"?
-It is beautiful.
Wow. Poetry.
Mm.
It’s so delicate.
The pastry melts in the mouth.
Crispy. And a little hint of spice
in there as well.
But the filling with the chickpea
is fantastic.
-Very clever.
-Who would have thought that was vegan?
It’s almost buttery. It’s so delicious.
-It is. Thank you, Rahul.
-Thank you.
-Thanks a lot. Thank you.

*Briony*
-[Paul] Just feels a bit flexible.
-Oh.
-Flexible?
-Yeah.
Flexible pastry.
[Paul] I’m thinking rubbery pastry.
-Oh, no.
-[Noel] Flexible tartlets.
[Paul] Looks like it’s been overworked.
It’s so weird, the veg on the top is veg
but then you’ve got this apple underneath,
which makes it sweet,
so no matter what you put on the top,
-the apple will always win.
-Okay.
[Prue] It’s an apple pie.
Dollop of crème fraiche
and it would be delicious.
Oh... sorry.
[Paul] This looks better.
This is the poppy seed.
-[Prue] Gives it a bit of colour too.
-Yeah, it does.
Very nice and thin pastry.
I mean, that’s amazing.
The onions are the sort
of the ones you put on a hot dog.
Right.
But the overall flavour
actually is all right.
-Okay.
-I quite like the flavour.
I think the flavour’s lovely.
I think there’s too much onion.
Okay. Can I ask about the rubbery
on the flexible?
Was it rubbery or was it okay?
Actually, the pastry on that
was all right.
Okay. Good.
Were your flexible alarm bells ringing?
Thank you.

*Jon*
[Paul] Where’s the rest of it?
Uh, I ran out of filling and I drastically
ran out of time as well.
[Paul] I can see that.
[Jon] Quite unfinished.
[Prue] It’s a bit undercooked under there.
Yes.
Okay, let’s have a look.
They are a little bit untidy
because they’re not full
and maybe you chose the wrong size.
[Prue] They do look a bit of a mess.
[Paul laughs]
[Prue] It’s a bit gluey.
It is very rubbery, the pastry.
It’s the flavour of the tomatoes
I don't particularly like,
-it’s very artificial.
-It’s just too heavy.
[Paul] It’s not good.
Let’s have a look at the falafel.
Base isn’t too bad.
[Prue] Again, it doesn't look
wonderfully attractive, does it?
I quite like the flavour of the falafel.
The pastry’s still a little bit rubbery.
The potato adding to it doesn't really
bring a lot, just a little bit of colour.
It’s not bad. It’s all right, you know.
Both the flavours are good but too strong.
But also the pastry’s very pale
and it’s really untidy.
This has caught you out a little bit.
It’s not your thing, is it?
It’s not my thing at all.
I will admit to that.

*Kim-Joy*
[Paul] It’s very, uh, neat.
Very artistic. Baked well.
[Prue] Nice colour.
It’s quite nice the, um, layers.
The coconut pastry.
It’s amazing.
I think the flavour’s are great.
You’ve got the cooling that comes
from the tofu before you hit the onion.
It’s absolutely delicious.
I’d never have said
that would have gone together.
Yeah, I like that one.
Ah, thank you.
[Paul] Remind me of this one again?
Um, so that’s got tofu, broccoli,
onion, the tomato on top.
It’s got a bit of Indian black salt
for the eggyness.
That’s delicious.
The balance of flavour is very good.
Again, the tofu is bringing
that little bit of
coolness to it
and the pastry’s flaky, it’s buttery.
-Thank you.
-Very good job on both of them.
-Very good job. Looks good.
-Thank you.
No, uh...
On vegan week?
Go on, go on, go on.
That’s really good. Well done.
Thank you. I can’t believe that.

Briony, would you like to bring
your showstopper up, please?
Briony, tell us about your showstopper?
So this is my hazelnut mocha vegan cake
with raspberry jam,
chocolate ganache and then
there’s some buttercream roses.
Well, I must say
it looks as neat as a pin.
Thank you.
I do like the look of that.
It’s very elegant.
Solid piece and sits on the plate
without a crumb out of place.
[Prue] Perfect three layers.
Mm.
-[Paul] The raspberry lifts everything...
-Mm.
Because the mocha’s very delicate.
I quite like it. It’s different.
I think you’ve done a good job actually...
-Thank you.
-on flavour, texture,
look. It’s a very nice cake
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done, Briony.

*Jon*
It looks a bit sad.
It’s knocked off.
[all laughing]
It’s very, um, crude in its decoration.
[Prue] I quite like the animal print.
It looks like Bet Lynch’s skirt actually.
What’s in it?
[Jon] It’s, uh, chocolate and orange cake
with chocolate sponge,
with orange curd in there
and orange buttercream.
[Prue] Jon, I think your layers
are really good, they’re even.
It’s a bit claggy.
[Paul] I enjoy that flavour.
The orange in there is really nice
and sharp, carries it through.
I mean, it looks hideous,
but the flavour of it is, um, very good.
Thank you. Cheers.
For me, there’s a bit too much orange curd
but I think it’s a good cake.
Thank you.

*Manon*
[Prue] It’s absolutely beautiful.
Very delicately done.
The naked cake is perfect.
When you get it right, Manon,
you really get it right, don't ya?
-Thank you.
-Let’s have a look inside shall we?
Very neat coming out.
[Prue] Looks a bit pudding-ey.
[Paul] It does, doesn't it?
It’s really heavy.
Yeah.
[Prue] Gluey.
It’s not good. Looks great, tastes awful.
Oh, really?
It is like an under-baked cake
and it’s quite rubbery as well, actually.
It’s like it’s been overworked.
It’s been over-mixed.
Apple, I’m certainly not getting.
It’s not a good cake at all.
That’s a shame.

*Kim-Joy*
I love the colours.
I think they’re very pretty
and subtle and unusual.
If I was to relate a cake
to anyone in this tent,
I’d certainly relate this cake to you.
The decoration is exquisite.
You’ve gone to the trouble
of making biscuits too.
It’s standing up.
I think it’s a nice looking cake.
Thank you.
-Now, this is lavender sponge?
-Yes.
[Prue] Very good.
Mm.
Quite powerful lavender.
It’s very pudding like, isn’t it?
[Prue] Hmm.
[Paul] But nevertheless,
I think the balance between lavender,
which is very brave of you to do...
-Phew.
-and the lemon,
which is again quite sharp,
works together very well.
Well done. I think
that’s a really nice cake.
-Ah, thank you very much.
-[Prue] Well done, Kim-Joy.
[sighs]

*Rahul*
What happened?
When I constructed them,
it was standing okay,
and then I put it in the fridge,
and then I left,
and when I come back it was...
[Paul] Okay, let’s have a look at it.
I might not put the drizzle as well
because I put a coconut drizzle,
which might have actually softened
the whole thing up.
Well, I think I can see your problem.
I think it could be the drizzle.
It’s the drizzle,
it just makes it really soggy, yeah.
It’s weakened the whole thing
and you can see
where it’s compressed in the middle
-and the whole things just given way.
-Collapsed. Yeah.
The chocolate is good. The coconut one
has just been drenched. It’s too much.
It actually tastes
of too much coconut too.
You’re trying too hard
to get too much flavour
into something that was already big.
You had enough flavour in there
without any drizzle.
[Prue] That is a pity.

*Ruby*
It’s gonna be a bit difficult
to put the best side forward.
So let’s go that way.
Because it’s a collapsed mess,
it looks... I mean,
it looks like a disaster.
-Yeah.
-Right.
I had to put in quite
a few dowels at the end,
so you’ll probably hit a lot of, uh...
[Paul] Wow.
More dowel than cake.
Yes.
Do you envisage them being eaten together?
-No. Either the chocolate or the lemon.
-Right.
Mm.
I like that.
Lemon-ey. Coconut-ey. Delicious.
Um, I like the lemon cake.
I like the flavour of the raspberries
in there as well
and actually I like the chocolate one too.
They’re actually both very good cakes.
I think you got it the wrong way round.
Yeah.
I think if you’d put the chocolate,
which is a lot more stable
than the lemon...
-Yeah.
-underneath,
it would have been fine.
Yeah, I think the sponge in the lemon one,
it was really soft.
So it was just a, uh,
bad judgment.

Vegan week. I mean, Paul,
you weren’t happy before we started.
How do you feel now?
A bit disappointed with people.
Mainly Manon.
It was an awful cake
and yet it was exquisite to look at.
Okay, so is it going to be
that the look is one thing
but the taste is the paramount thing
because Ruby’s...
Exactly. I would have given Ruby’s
higher marks than Manon’s
because Ruby’s was edible.
It was delicious.
[Paul] But you can’t discount her
from the possibility of leaving us.
At the end of the day, it fell,
and it was her fault.
I think we’ve got a real problem
with the judging.
Coming into the Showstopper,
we’d put Briony, Ruby,
Jon and obviously, you had to put
Kim-Joy in there
because she came last in the technical,
in a little bit of trouble.
Briony’s saved herself
because that cake was pretty good.
The hazelnut, the mocha.
It was a very neat looking cake.
Kim-Joy saved herself and then some.
We put Rahul and Manon up for Star Baker.
But Rahul has had a hideous...
Well, you’d say that
but actually his cake,
the flavour, actually wasn't that bad.
At the same time, I have to put Kim-Joy up
as Star Baker as well.
[Sandi] Her fox cake looked great
so I thought.
-[Paul] Beautiful colours.
-And you know what, the flavour was good.
So I think what you’re looking at, Kim-Joy
and I would say, you have to say Rahul
still up for Star Baker.
And I would say Ruby and Jon...
-Bumping along the bottom.
-Yes.
Well, well done, bakers.
Really successful vegan week.
[Noel] Ironically, the Star Baker
is someone who brought animals
into the tent
but in a whimsical, colourful way.
Star baker this week is Kim-Joy.
Well done.
-Foxy Baker.
-Foxy.
Ah.
Ah, man.
I have to say this gets
tougher and tougher
every week because we are
so fond of all of you
and it is a really a horrible job.
Uh, but I’m afraid the person
who’s going home is...
Jon.
I’m so sorry.
[Jon] Okay.
[Sandi] You did such a great job.
[Jon] Immensely proud
of what I’ve achieved. 
To make it past week one,
I was immensely proud.
But to make it to week seven,
absolutely amazing.
-You were brilliant.
-Cheers, anyway.
-It’s been amazing. It really has.
-Oh, Jon.
I am sad to see Jon go.
He’s got such personality.
He’s so different from everybody else.
He’s actually a very good baker
and his flavours are always
very, very good.
-Well done, my darling.
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.
-I really didn't think that would happen.
Star baker of vegan week.
I can’t believe I’m saying those words.
Kim-Joy has done really well
to win Star Baker.
I told ya. I told ya.
Overall, she was certainly
the best on vegan week.
Oh, Ruby, I'm so pleased.
Are they sure? Like, positive?
Vegan week was hard.
Really, really hard.
Group hug.
[Manon] Let’s hug. Well done, everyone.
[Prue] Five left now.
Quarter-final coming up.
I have no idea
who’s going to win this thing.
