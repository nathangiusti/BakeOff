*Kate*
This one ends up on the floor,
and they could've done
with a bit longer in the oven as well,
but I ran out of time at the end.
They do look a bit of a mess.
Never mind, maybe it'll all be redeemed
because they will be so delicious.
But how is he meant to tell
which end he's eating?
Well, it was going to have decoration on,
but again, time.
You ran out of time.
[Paul] The pastry's quite tough.
[Prue] But that's because it's not cooked.
You needed more seasoning in there.
You get a texture of rice,
and that's pretty much what you get.
It's a shame. Right, the sweet.
I really like that, for rice pudding.
It's not too claggy, isn't it?
That is properly good.
I think nearly all your problems
come down to underbaking.
The pastry's just not right.
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Okay.

*Liam*
When you look at the uniformity,
it's there.
Great colour, the cuts are distinct.
I think you've done a great job.
-They look very, very good.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Mmm.
-Wow, that's delicate to pick up, that.
Ooh, lovely. Huh, you're so mean. So mean.
You are so good at flavour.
Lovely pesto, bang.
And that pastry is so, so delicate,
I mean, you can barely pick it up.
[Prue] Just perhaps not quite
robust enough for a clanger.
Are you gonna try the dip?
Do you know, it's perfectly all right,
but Mediterranean flavours are so strong,
-you really don't need it.
-[Paul] Mmm. No, I agree.
Right, the sweet.
The flavours are very, very good.
I think the, the balance
to the fruit is excellent.
The pastry is so light, though.
Next time, work that pastry
a little bit more. Okay?
-Cool.
-[Paul] Thank you.

*Sophie*
Lovely colour, like the decoration, and...
I love the pig. Love, love, love the pig.
-[Paul] Yeah. Have you scored this?
-Yes.
-[Prue] Mmm.
-It's weakened it slightly there.
-[Sophie] Yep.
-But it, it's robust. Right.
[Paul] The pastry's
a little bit too thick.
I think it's baked well, it's spongy,
which is what it should be,
just think it's a little bit too thick.
[Prue] I'm a bit disappointed
in the filling,
because it's sort of,
predominantly soy flavour.
-Yeah.
-I'm not getting much else.
[Paul] Right.
Lovely flavour, bit dry.
Okay.
With the fact that your pastry's
still thick, that doesn't help.
-[Sophie] Yeah.
-It's just a bit of a shame.

*Steven*
You've been desperate
to get rid of those, haven't you?
Do you not have these in your bakery?
Clearly not.
[Paul] It's not very robust, though...
[Steven] No.
[Paul] If you're carrying that
into a field.
It's very good, and I think
it's the right texture.
It's moist without being sloppy.
Mmm.
[Paul] Beautiful flavour.
I love the spices, the blends.
-Mmm.
-It's a proper monstrous meal,
it's gorgeous. Now, looking
at the pudding, this is the baklava.
[Steven] Yeah.
-Mmm.
-I think that's absolutely delicious.
[Paul] I just think it's totally the wrong
shape, it's, it's almost collapsed,
but the texture of the pastry
is very good.
-Thank you, Steven, delicious.
-Thank you very much. Thank you.

*Stacey*
There's been a little,
erm, blueberry explosion,
so we know which end is sweet, even if
you hadn't put sweeties on.
[Paul] Go in here.
I think you've got a great texture there.
The pastry is nice and flaky,
it's a little bit soft,
as I'd expect from a suet crust.
That, that's lovely, that.
The pastry's flaky, it's light,
it's got lots of flavour,
it's got a nice crisp on the outside,
and it's baked all the way through.
The caramelised onions
are the heroes in there.
Beautiful flavours. The sweet.
[Prue] I'm amazed
that you got such good texture,
because the blueberries were raw,
and I rather expected them to sog up the
bottom of the pastry, but they haven't.
-That, young lady...
-Mmm.
-...is absolutely delicious, that side.

*Stacey*
Wow, Stacey, it really has got
about 20 elements to it, hasn't it?
I'm very impressed that you've got
all the cakes out quite cleanly.
There's a nice shiny sugar crust.
But you struggled with the meringue.
Yeah, it... They weren't done in time.
-But overall I think it's very you.
-[Paul] Stacey.
-[Sandi] It's very Stacey. It...
-Victorian Stacey.
[Paul] And we've got the orange one
on the top, is that right?
Yeah.
[Paul] It's got a nice texture.
Great flavour.
-Mmm.
-Really nice flavour,
the texture's amazing, and the orange
comes through well.
Now, this is your lemon one,
is that right?
[Prue] Yep. Very good texture.
It's not as well flavoured
as the other, is it?
[Paul] It's there, it's not as potent
as the orange one.
So, you've got madeleines, you've got
macarons, you've got some jelly.
The mandarins are a little bit flat,
but you've got the raspberry right
in the middle of that, haven't you?
[Prue] Mmm. Yeah, the raspberry's
very nice, but the macarons,
because they've been sandwiched
with the curd have got very soggy.
The macarons I don't particularly like,
I don't think they're well baked.
[Prue] Have you tried a hard jelly?
Very nice.
[Paul] I think overall, you've just gone
slightly OTT on the decoration.
But your two cakes are good.
And it's a massive work,
probably a titch overambitious,
but I think it's a real achievement.

*Liam*
[Paul] I think it looks
a little bit haphazard.
[Prue] It's a bit topsy-turvy.
I like the decoration
of the sugar, that's fine,
but you can see what's happened,
that over time we, it will collapse,
humidity gets to it, destroys it.
-So it's elderflower.
-Elderflower and lemon.
It's quite dense.
Yeah.
Almost like
you've overmixed it, you know?
-Yeah.
-[Prue] I think you did.
But I'm just not catching
any flavours at all.
Okay.
The most flavour you get from this is
if you happen to get a bit of caramel.
It's a little disappointing.
[Paul] It is a little bit.
The top layer is better than the bottom,
I think the bottom one is burnt.
-A quarter-final, you want...
-[Liam] Yeah.
Consistency.
I think you've had a really great idea,
Liam, don't think you quite pulled it off.

*Sophie*
Sophie, I think that is a perfect shape
of a Victorian Savoy Cake.
It's nice and high,
it's spectacular to look at,
and the chocolate top is magnificent.
[Paul] It's very, very clever.
If you break through, you've got
your plinth down at the bottom down there,
which is sandwiched as well,
so you've given that a flavour.
It's well baked all the way through,
you've got a nice sugar coating
on the top of it as well,
and I love the design.
You've celebrated the Savoy Cake,
which I like.
Right, I'm gonna take a slice out of this.
-The texture of the cake is quite chewy.
-[Sophie] Okay.
But it's very pleasant.
I love the flavour. I just think,
when you mixed it,
you may have just turned it
a couple of more times than you needed to.
-Okay.
-And you've lost that air.
But you're not far off it.
-[Prue] Remind me what's in there?
-Er, green apple Crème Diplomat.
Mmm, I love that green apple, really good.
I love that whole cake, actually.
Thank you.

*Steven*
Very elegant, very simple.
-Mmm.
-Very small.
It makes you question, what have you
spent the last few hours making?
All the time's been spent on the roses,
and they do look beautiful.
It's very elegant.
[Prue] I must say that your sugar coating
looks really good,
and I do think you've been very clever,
'cause those walnuts
perfectly fit the mould.
That's beautifully done.
-Now, right in the middle there you have--
-They're cinnamon apples.
Lovely cinnamon apple.
-Not what I expected.
-No, but it is delicious,
and the texture, I think, is lovely.
It's actually very brave of you
to put the chestnuts in there,
because chestnut in itself
is quite a heavy thing.
Yeah.
But actually it hasn't affected
the texture too much,
it's still quite light, but for me,
if you're gonna put chestnut in it,
get the flavour to come out,
'cause it hasn't.
-Okay.
-But nevertheless, very pretty design.
Thank you.

*Kate*
Kate, please bring up your Savoy Cake.
Do you want some help?
Yes, please.
-Ready?
-Yep, ready.
This is like the weirdest removal firm.
-I can see what it is, with the top...
-Mmm.
...of the Liver Building,
but it's a bit simplistic.
The bottom plinth
has had a few major issues.
Yeah, it didn't turn out properly.
These seem to have caught again.
It's all a bit broken up.
[Prue] I do think
it's a bit rough and ready,
but I like the fact
that she's got the height.
Yeah, yeah. It's a bold piece.
The sugar coating on it's good,
but look how yellow that is.
Sixty eggs have made that
very, very yellow.
It's a bit dry, actually.
[Prue] Mmm, I was wondering
if it's a bit overcooked, in fact.
Mmm, I think it could be.
[Prue] Oh, that's the one
with pecans in it.
That's a much better cake.
-That's delicious.
-[Prue] It's moister, too.
Mmm. I'm biased anyway,
'cause I love the Liver Building,
but star of the show
is that third one down.
-I just think all the others, too dry.
