*Henry*
[Paul] The definition is fantastic.
You know, the blades that are
sticking out. It looks great.
Okay, let's have a look inside.
[Henry] The dairy I've used is a yogurt.
It's very delicious.
It's a very nice, light cake.
And that's the whole test.
I love the nuts and the apple in there,
because they actually blend
beautifully well together.
-It's a really good cake.
-Thank you very much.
Yeah.

*Rosie*
What's the alcohol level in there?
-Er, it's--
-High.
It's just vodka
with some homemade limoncello.
Perfect for Prue.
The use of the cultured milk,
-spot-on.
-Thank you.
[Paul] The sponge is light, it's airy.
That lemon comes through.
[smacks lips] Rosie, that is beautiful.
-[laughing]
-[Prue] Thank you, darling.
That's the right place for it.
Thank you very much, Rosie.

*Helena*
It's both scary and sweet.
[Paul] Its got a lovely, erm,
structure, lovely colour.
[Prue] It's good.
For a madwoman, you're doing well.
[Paul] Pot, kettle.

*David*
[Prue] It's very neat.
Beautiful. Can't wait to taste it.
[Paul] The structure inside
is nice and light.
The lemon comes through.
Poppy is one of my favourite things
to bake with. I think it's fantastic.
I love it, I really do.

*Steph*
So much chocolate.
That is the answer
to everything, isn't it?
That is the answer to everything.
Erm, buttermilk is the dairy in there.
It's lovely, light, moist sponge,
which is how it should be.
[Prue] It is so rich.
A little bit will go a long way.
-Well done, thank you.
-[Sandi] Well done, Steph.

*Phil*
[Prue] The decoration's
a little disappointing.
-It's just a bit messy.
-Okay.
[Paul] Texture's pretty good, actually.
I'm not getting a lot of rose.
You could have dialled that up more.
-[Phil] Mm-hmm.
-[Paul] Thank you.

*Alice*
Well, Alice,
I think it looks really, really pretty.
[Paul] Let's have a look.
The, erm, cake is a little bland.
[Paul] Where's the lemon drizzle?
Where's the cardamom?
And where's the pistachio?
But, erm, actually, the texture is good.
It's light, it's moist.
Thank you very much indeed.

*Priya*
-[Paul] Decoration is good.
-Very good.
I'll hold judgment
on what the texture's like.
Hmm. That is a lot of chocolate.
And that outside is really tough.
[Paul] Hmm.
But, erm, your banana bread
is beautiful, actually.
It's got such a lightness to it.
Thank you, Priya.

*Michelle*
The little meringues
look really beautiful.
[Paul] Okay, let's have a look inside.
It's not as loose and open
as I expected it to be.
Okay.
[Paul] Could be the liquid from
the rhubarb that's dripping in there.
In the middle, it's... claggy.
Is there a Welsh word for "claggy"?
-I think it's "claggy".
-If there is, I don't use it.
[all laughing]

*Michael*
-[Paul] Hi, Michael.
-Right.
-Yeah.
[Prue] Tell us all about it.
The sticking problem.
[Paul] You've lost the definition.
It's ripped, half of it's missing,
it's cracked down the middle,
the icing looks terrible.
[Sandi chuckles]
[Paul] Okay, let's have a look inside.
[chuckles] That is delicious.
[Paul] Very clever with the raspberry
cheesecake folding through it.
-Tastes great, looks a mess.
-Okay.
-Yeah.
-Thank you.


Steph, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper?
[Steph] Yeah.
[Prue] They're very neat.
They look amazing. I love the pink.
-Reminds me of a hot-dog.
-[Noel chuckles]
I'm open to suggestions
of what they remind you of.
-[Noel] Pink Panther's hot-dog.
-[Paul] Let's see what they taste like.
[Steph] Rose and pistachio.
Get the middle bit as well.
Enough flavour in the rose,
a lovely combination.
Shall we try one of these?
[Paul] That's very good as well.
It's a great blend between
the mango and the coconut.
-Clever with your flavours.
-I think you've done well.
-[Paul] Thank you.
-[Sandi] Well done, lovely.

*David*
Very neat, very precise, very accurate.
-[Prue] And I lust after this necklace.
-[laughing] It's very you, Prue.
[David] So, it's kewra water
and pomegranate.
[Paul] It melts,
releasing all the flavours.
Really good. Quite aromatic.
[Prue] And this carrot is delicious.
The flavours are interesting.
Excellent.

*Alice*
They look great, 'cause
it looks like an afternoon tea.
The cheesecake is moist and creamy.
[Paul] This one,
that's very pleasant as well.
It is like a carrot cake
but with a much thicker paste.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done.
[Sandi] Well done.

*Helena*
I love the look of it.
It could easily be at a wedding.
[Paul] Erm, that lemon's
probably the best one for me.
-The citrus flavour is strong.
-[Prue] Lovely.
[Prue] The biscuit is beautiful.
That it is so difficult
not to just eat it. [chuckles]
Thank you.

*Rosie*
[Paul] It looks very good.
The colours match up beautifully as well.
Really delicious.
You can taste the cardamom and saffron.
It's nicely aromatic, isn't it?
-[Prue] It's beautiful.
-[Paul] The spice blend is good.
[Prue] All of them are very clever.
Rosie, I think
you should be proud of yourself.

*Michelle*
-[Paul] They do look nice. Nice colour.
-[Prue] Mm.
[Paul] Very different to each other.
The one I don't really like,
that flowerpot one down there.
That one's my favourite,
'cause I love rice pudding.
-I do, but that's not rice pudding.
-Oh, okay.

*Henry*
I think you didn't finish,
and that one looks a bit, erm, melted.
It's got a nice vanilla.
I mean, the texture's wrong
'cause it's melted, but it tastes okay.
You'd eat it if you were given it.
-As a prisoner, maybe.
-[Paul] "As a prisoner."
-[all laughing]
-Yes.
"Maybe."

*Michael*
Really stylish. I love the fact
that they're such different shapes.
Okay.
Really delicious.
Apricot goes beautifully with the coconut.
Not too sweet.
These little ones,
the almond really lifts it.
Okay.
[Paul] That lemon, that's very good
as well. Thank you.
Well done, darling.

*Priya*
It would've been good
if you could've got a bit more colour
into the actual edible things
rather than from the decoration.
[Priya] They are deep-fried and soaked
in a rose and lychee syrup.
I quite like it because it is fried.
They're quite savoury.
[Prue] Shall we try one of these?
It's very difficult to get saffron right
and that is absolutely right.
[Paul] This one, it's nice.
It's got a good mango flavour.
Very creamy.
Overall, could've introduced
a little bit more colour in.
Nevertheless, the flavours are good.
Your flavours are pretty good.
Thank you, Priya.

*Phil*
[Prue chuckles] Sorry,
I was just laughing at the gnome.
-That's my dad, do you mind?
-I was gonna say something but I won't.
It's very colourful.
The rest of them are all so classy,
they couldn't do it.
[chuckling]
-A sort of backhanded compliment.
-Yeah.
I'll take that.
[Prue] Try a pebble.
I wouldn't like to eat very much of it
because it tastes slightly fake.
[Paul] You've really gone overboard
with your flavours, actually.
Just hit them with extracts
and then stamp them.
They're all pretty samey, aren't they?
-But thank you very much, Phil.
-Thank you.



[Sandi] I loved this Showstopper.
I was amazed at the different flavours
and the enthusiasm and the variety
and the colours.
-[Sandi] This looks fab.
-[Prue] It's exquisite.
Star Baker potentials?
-I think Steph did well.
-[Sandi] Hmm.
[Paul] I think David's done well.
We have our Star Baker in one of those.
Henry could not get Star Baker.
I mean, he just did three round balls,
which was, you know, we're always after...
-Like a mutant.
-[laughing]
But let's not dwell on Henry's balls.
Let's have a look at
who's suddenly in trouble.
Michael, Priya...
-Phil.
-Er, I think Phil's dropped.
-Really disappointing. Very simple stuff.
-Yeah.
That was, erm,
almost kindergarten playdough.
[Sandi] Oh, okay.
Could be the week for two people?
It very much could be, yeah.
It's very, very close.
Yeah.
Well, bakers, I now have the pleasure
of telling you who is Star Baker.
So, the person who is Star Baker
this week,
er, was very close last week
to achieving the title,
but this week has absolutely nailed it.
Our Star Baker is Steph.
[all cheering and clapping]
[Phil] Well done.
Fantastic.
Well done.
That means I've got the horrible job
of announcing
the baker who's leaving us this week.
The person who's leaving us
this week is...
Phil.
[Sandi] Sorry, Phil.
-[Michelle] What the hell is that?
-Don't know.
Oh, Phil, pal.
[Michelle] What the heck is that?
Oh, my God.
[sighs] Dairy week.
Curse the dairy week.
Still, I had a good run.
Such an amazing group of people.
Fantastic.
Absolutely loved every second of it.
-What are you playing at?
-[laughing]
-It's his fault, you know that?
-[Phil] What are you playing at?
Phil was particularly shocked.
And he had justification to be shocked
because it was that tight,
it was that close.
It was a little bit boring,
a little bit too simple.
He struggled in the Showstopper,
which is why, sadly, Phil had to leave.
-[all laughing] Oh, Phil.
-[Priya] Get in.
I'm through. Oh, God, what a weekend.
It's a massive relief.
I think, "Am I gonna be feeling like
I'm gonna be going home every week
for every week that I stay in?"
Is this just how it it?
[Michael] I knew that Priya and I
were in the bottom.
I feel a bit guilty, perhaps,
for even being here next week...
[Sandi whispering]
...but mainly thrilled for Steph.
Because, wow.
I was so pleased for Steph.
She's a very serious baker.
-Hello?
-[Steph's mum] Hello.
Erm, okay, so, erm, I just got Star Baker.
-Oh, my God. Really?
-[chuckling] Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Bloody hell, Steph.
We're in the car park.
[laughing] Mum, you're not meant to swear.
I'm not meant to swear on TV. Oh, sorry.
I'm so sorry. I can't believe it.
You've got to start believing
in yourself, Steph.
-I know you won't, so it's all right.
-[laughing]
