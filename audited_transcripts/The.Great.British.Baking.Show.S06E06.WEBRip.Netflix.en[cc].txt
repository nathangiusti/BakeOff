*Ruby*
[Paul] The pastry is crispy,
thin all round.
[Ruby] Yeah. You've got potato,
peas and onions.
[exhales]
-It's quite hot.
-It's too spicy.
Sorry. I never know when to stop.
I like the fact that you haven't scrimped,
-you've just gone right, there it is.
-[Ruby] Way in-- Yeah.
What I like about it is that you've been
brave enough to say, "Right...
-Yeah.
-...I'm not going to try
and improve on the samosa
or do anything fancy,"
and you've done them perfectly.
Thank you.
[Prue] Let's try the sweet one.
Mm. Good strong orange.
[Paul] I get the almond in there.
I get the date in there.
It's a juggernaut of flavour
on both. Yeah.
-Oh!
-Yes!
-Amazing. Thank you.
-[all clapping]
-[Paul] Well done, Rube.
-Thank you so much.
Stunning. The only thing I will say is
get your mum to write down
her chutney recipe.

*Jon*
The pastry's okay in places.
Some of them are quite soggy there.
Yeah.
Mm. The chicken pesto, it's delicious.
Yeah? Oh, thank you.
I didn't think that would work.
-[Paul] Your sweet one. Interesting.
-[Jon] The jam might need a spoon.
[laughing]
Not so much a dipping
-but bit more of a--
-It's not a dip, it's a smear.
The flavour's great.
You've got the orange,
the crème pât. Beautiful.

*Briony*
-[Prue] So beautiful.
-[Sandi] So beautiful.
-[Briony] Thank you.
-You can hardly bear to eat them.
I think the pastry's perfect, actually,
and the texture,
because you've got the nut in there
as well and the beetroot.
-[Prue] But the sweet one is too gluey.
-[Briony] Okay.
-Peanut butter, you always-- It always is.
-Yeah.
But great job. I mean, best looking
samosa I think I've ever seen.
Thank you.

*Kim-Joy*
I have never had a samosa
with a Pythagoras theorem on...
Mm.
[Paul] The pastry is beautiful and light.
Very traditional flavours.
It's almost like you're,
you're missing something.
Is it spicy enough? 'Cause I thought
it might need a bit more chilli.
That would have helped.
But I must say, the apple chai samosa
is absolutely lovely.
Okay. Thank you very much.
[laughs]

*Dan*
I think we know where we're going here.
[all laughing]
Bit tough, Prue?
[Sandi] How could you guess that?
-Just a bit. Just a bit.
-[all laughing]
-Oh, Dan, taste that.
-[Dan] Goodness me.
[sarcastically] Wonderfully soft.
When you lie your face goes red.
You know, you got that.
[both laughing]
It seems to be absolutely about
too much water in the pastry.
[Paul] It's gone more like a bread. See?
Mmm-hmm.
They are both like leather
but the fillings are beautiful.
Well, that's one out of two.

*Rahul*
[Paul] I love this little pattern
you've got on the top.
They look quite authentic, don't they?
Rahul, if I tell you that
they are absolutely delicious quickly,
will you start looking happier?
[Paul] Great flavours.
What it is, is the texture.
You've got the nut, the flavours,
the spices...
-Oh, Rahul.
-...and that with the raita as well,
it's that cooling effect.
The whole thing together
'cause the pastry is beautifully crispy,
it almost melts in the mouth.
The sweet one.
The oil in the coconut is so moist.
I think it's absolutely faultless.
[Sandi laughing]
If he doesn't put his hand out
and give you a handshake,
I'm going to kill him.
That's okay. It's fine.
If you like it, that's...
Wow. Death or shake?
[exhales]
Erm, your mother would be
very proud of them.

*Manon*
[Paul] The pastry's a little bit thick
on the top.
Yeah.
-It's split a bit on a couple there.
-Mm.
There is much more potato
than there is chicken,
so the chicken has a hard time
coming forward.
-Okay.
-[Paul] The sweet one.
I just think it's a little bit too dry.
-Okay.
-You do get the apple
but you need that caramel
and that caramel's too thick
as a dipping sauce.
This is disappointing.

Kim-Joy, please bring up
your shaped banquet pie.
"Silke The Vegetarian Mermaid."
-[all laugh]
-[Prue] That is so Kim-Joy.
It looks great
and what a great looking puff pastry,
you can see by the flakes in that.
But there's quite a big spot of dough
there where it's extra thick,
-which is a little bit worrying.
-[Kim-Joy] Yeah.
[Paul] The caramelised onion
works really well.
The beetroot works and everything works
but it's just that pastry's too soggy.
It's a pity
because it's so beautifully made
and it its top marks for decoration.

*Ruby*
The colour's good, decorations good.
It's quite effective.
[Prue] The plaiting of that,
it's astonishing.
[Paul] It's held together lovely.
Hmm, Ruby, that is really good
hot water crust pastry.
-Thank you.
-It's tasty, it's crisp.
The rice has really done its job
of soaking in all the juices
down to the bottom.
That with the curry together
is absolutely delicious.
It's a great pie.
-Amazing, thank you.
-Thank you.

*Rahul*
[Prue] The insect's just exquisite.
I love the colours. Beautiful.
But as soon as you get inside
it starts to get a little bit wet.
I put only two little steam holes,
I should have put more.
I love that.
[Paul] The lamb is beautifully cooked,
and the flavours, the spices
are perfectly blended.

*Jon*
Jon, I think the dragon lost the fight?
Where's his wings?
-Not all dragons have wings.
-Oh, right.
Wh-- Oh, let's get
into the reality of this.
[all laughing]
It's a monster sausage roll, isn't it?
It tastes delicious.
But it's really wet.
This is full butter puff pastry.
It's all about the chilling process
to get a bit of flake butteriness
and you never thought that through.
Time constraints with everything else
was my problem.

*Dan*
Looks more like a monkfish
than it does a salmon, doesn't it?
Looks great though.
I know we had this conversation before
but my reaction is just that
it doesn't look appetising.
I don't want to eat it
partly because it's so good.
It looks like a great raw fish
sitting there.
Feel like it needs cooking.
Yeah.
Does it?
Quite possibly.
[chuckling]
[Paul] It's raw all the way around.
It could have been a bit of dough,
you know what I mean, anything.
The fish is a lovely flavour,
coriander pancakes delicious too.
But this is about pastry,
it's about a celebration of pastry.
[Dan] Yeah, I know.
-And that is not a celebration of pastry.
-No, it isn't.
It's clever. The idea's sound enough
and I do like the look of it.
-Thank you very much, Dan.
-Thank you.

*Manon*
[Paul] You wouldn't know
unless you said that's an octopus.
If you'd opened it up a bit
and really elaborated on the fact
that they are tentacles,
it would have looked more effective.
There is a bit of baking paper underneath.
It's on baking paper?
-'Cause it got stuck?
-Yes.
[Paul] I'm taking the paper with me.
-See that underneath Prue?
-[Prue] Hm-mm.
It needed longer.
Hmm, a bit too much salt.
-It's very salty, isn't it?
-Hmm.
[Prue] It's too salty,
it's a little bit dry.
The pastry needed more baking
and the fish needed less cooking.

*Briony*
-You are a dark horse, aren't you?
-[laughs]
-It's absolutely wonderful.
-Thank you.
[Paul] The little intricate pieces of work
looks very clever.
And that's playable croquet
with the little flamingos.
[Prue] Oh, look there's the hedgehog.
[Briony] There's the hedgehog ball
and he'll go through the little--
Okay, here we come.
[Briony cheers and laughs]
You missed.
Okay, I think the baking of it
is very good.
-Thank you.
-I hold reservation,
because you've got game in there as well
and it's notorious for flooding out
when you cut it.
Yes, I know,
I am a bit nervous about that.
[Paul] Well done.
[Prue] Look at that.
-[Paul] Well done.
-[exhales and laughs]
[Prue] Oh, my God.
-Is this sweet potato?
-[Briony] Yes.
Well, I would have had much more of it.
-I... Yeah.
-That much venison is quite an ask.
-Glass of port? Port?
-Yes, please.
That's my girl.
This is pure Prue. Port, venison, croquet.
[all laughing]
I am happy.
And very slightly Mad Hatter-y.
-Yeah.
-[Briony] Thank you.
-Good stuff, well done.
-Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.
[all clapping]
[Briony] Really useful feedback
and I agree with them.
It would be amazing to get star baker,
of course, it would.
We'll wait and see, you never know.
Obviously, I could have done better.
It wasn't my days this week.
[voice breaking] If I get to next week
I'll be so happy.
I don't know if I can speak. [sniffles]
[Sandi] The one that seemed to me
to stop the show,
Briony's one, I just thought
it looked fantastic.
Oh, it was fantastic.
The whole of Alice in Wonderland
from page one to page 88 was there.
And a pie in the shape of a hat's
funny, right?
It is and I think she's in line
for star baker.
And I'd have to say, Rahul,
even though he disappointed slightly
with the pie...
The flavours were great.
Talking about fillings, you really liked
Ruby's filling, didn't you?
Oh, Ruby did get
her flavour combinations right
and the baking was very, very good.
Has she saved herself
enough to be star baker
or not quite that much?
I wouldn't-- You see, I wouldn't discount
her from star baker.
[Sandi] So where are we with Manon?
Too much sea salt in the octopus?
Yes, that was the one filling
that was badly flavoured
and it was overcooked.
She is certainly in the danger zone.
Really, really disappointing.
Let's have a look at the, er, salmon,
'cause I mean it does look sort of broad.
That's part of the fun,
it's almost like an illusion cake,
you know, and he's made like a real fish.
But the pastry was terrible.
I felt disappointed
because he's been so good
and so up there for weeks.
[Sandi] He has been star baker.
He just occasionally does things
where you think, "Wow."
-He's got a gift.
-He could get to the final.
Right, bakers,
end of a pastry filled week.
Now, one person
has really impressed throughout.
It has been a stellar performance
and I am delighted to tell you
that this week's star baker is Briony.
[all applauding]
Well done, babe.
-Thank you.
-Excellent.
Unfortunately, that leaves me
with the horrible job
of sending someone home...
And the person who's leaving us this week
is...
Dan.
Come on, mate.
Never mind.
-You had a really good run.
-[Kim-Joy] You're my Ms Cracker.
You had a good run, mate.
-You had a great run.
-Ah. Thank you.
[indistinct chatter]
It was a disastrous week though,
wasn't it?
Really sorry for you.
I think you're an incredible baker.
I am.
Yeah, well, that was expected, wasn't it?
It didn't take Nostradamus
to see that coming.
Oh, I shall miss you, Kim-Joy.
-Well, we will catch up.
-We will.
[Dan] I've had some good moments.
You know as a stay-at-home parent,
sometimes you don't get to feel
very sort of special or important,
so it's been quite nice to...
It's been quite nice to do
something for me.
[Prue] Oh, Dan.
Yeah, it was a bit of a mess though,
wasn't it?
[Prue] It was a bit, but it's such a pity
because you're such a good baker.
I think, sometimes,
pastry can be quite tricky
and I think pastry
was Dan's Achilles heel.
Sorry to see you go, mate.
I really am, genuinely, mate.
-Do better next week, please, Manon.
-Yeah, I will.
Relieved. Paul told me, er,
you better do better next week.
No pressure.
Thank you so much, Paul.
I'm thrilled, thank you.
I absolutely love Briony
and it's such a pleasure
to see her just burst out
and start blooming.
Star baker.
[Briony's husband whoops]
[indistinct chattering]
Thanks, hello, darling.
[Briony's mother] Say,"Well done."
[Briony's husband]
Say, "Well done, Mummy."
-[Briony's mother] No, she's not coming.
-No, she's not gonna say it, no.
[Briony's husband]
Oh, well, it's amazing.
