## Competition Evolution Commentary

### Week 1: Early Frontrunners Emerge
The season opened with **Nataliia** establishing herself as the clear favorite (73.2% finalist probability, 32.4% winner), earning Star Baker with a strong 8.27 average strength score. **Jessika** and **Lesley** rounded out the predicted top 3, with the field showing a wide spread of talent from 8.27 down to 3.78 (Hassan, who was eliminated).

### Week 2: The Great Shake-Up
Week 2 brought dramatic shifts in the predictions. **Tom** surged to dominance (98.8% finalist, 54.2% winner) with remarkably consistent performance (variance of just 0.03), claiming Star Baker. Meanwhile, **Nataliia** suffered a catastrophic collapse, plummeting from 1st to 7th place with a massive variance spike to 9.45—indicating highly inconsistent performance. **Jessika** maintained her position in the top tier despite dropping slightly, while **Iain** emerged as a dark horse with impressive consistency.

### Week 3: Volatility and New Contenders
**Tom** maintained his stranglehold on the competition with continued consistency (variance 0.12). **Jasmine** made a spectacular leap, climbing from 5th to 3rd place after earning Star Baker, though her high variance (3.10) suggests feast-or-famine performances. **Lesley** moved into the silver position with steady, reliable baking. The week saw further deterioration for previous favorites **Nataliia** (variance spiking to 5.50) and **Iain** (variance 4.65), with both now struggling in the bottom tier. **Jessika** fell out of the top 3 entirely due to increasing inconsistency.

### Week 4: The Jasmine Surge
By Week 4, a two-horse race emerged between **Tom** and **Jasmine**. While Tom maintained his near-lock on a finals spot (98.9%), **Jasmine's** winner probability exploded to 36.6% after claiming her second Star Baker award. Her average strength (8.05) now slightly exceeds Tom's (7.92), though her higher variance (2.99 vs 0.13) creates uncertainty. **Lesley** remained a steady third-place finisher, while former star **Jessika** was eliminated after her variance ballooned to 5.84—a cautionary tale of inconsistency in the tent.

### Key Patterns Observed
- **Consistency is King**: Tom's near-zero variance (.13) has made him the prohibitive favorite despite not having the highest raw strength score
- **High Variance Eliminates Contenders**: Nataliia, Iain, and Jessika all saw their chances evaporate when variance exceeded 4-5, regardless of their Star Baker wins
- **Late Surges Matter**: Jasmine's back-to-back strong performances transformed her from a long shot (17.8% in Week 2) to a genuine title contender
- **The Middle Ground Persists**: Lesley's steady, unspectacular consistency (variance 0.66) has kept her firmly in the finals conversation without ever threatening to win

As the competition enters its final stages, Tom appears virtually assured of a finals spot, while Jasmine and Lesley battle for the remaining positions. The question remains: can Jasmine's high-ceiling performances overcome Tom's machine-like consistency, or will variance prove her undoing?
