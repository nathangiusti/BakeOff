00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:58.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

62
00:02:58.285 --> 00:02:59.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

is a bland, boring samosas.

71
00:03:18.725 --> 00:03:20.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

72
00:03:20.725 --> 00:03:24.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Traditionally, it's fried,
and when you fry a samosa,

73
00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:27.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the key thing is it's crispy,
it's thin and it's light.

00:03:28.805 --> 00:03:31.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is samosa pastry with just some oil,

75
00:03:31.765 --> 00:03:34.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
some plain flour,
some salt and some water.

00:03:44.285 --> 00:03:45.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite a tough dough.

81
00:03:45.405 --> 00:03:48.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's, it's very easy
to keep on adding lashings of water

82
00:03:48.405 --> 00:03:50.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you don't want your pastry
to be too soggy.

83
00:03:50.845 --> 00:03:52.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

the gluten gets too developed

86
00:03:59.645 --> 00:04:03.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

And also it's very likely to be tough.

-Yeah.
-...I'm not going to try

00:13:53.445 --> 00:13:54.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and improve on the samosa
or do anything fancy,"

310
00:13:55.045 --> 00:13:56.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you've done them perfectly.

311
00:13:56.365 --> 00:13:57.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

312
00:13:57.285 --> 00:13:58.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Let's try the sweet one.

313
00:14:01.445 --> 00:14:04.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm. Good strong orange.

314
00:14:04.445 --> 00:14:06.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I get the almond in there.
I get the date in there.

315
00:14:06.485 --> 00:14:10.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a juggernaut of flavour
on both. Yeah.

316
00:14:10.125 --> 00:14:11.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh!
-Yes!

317
00:14:11.565 --> 00:14:13.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Amazing. Thank you.
-[all clapping]

318
00:14:13.125 --> 00:14:14.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Well done, Rube.
-Thank you so much.

319
00:14:14.965 --> 00:14:16.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stunning. The only thing I will say is

320
00:14:16.885 --> 00:14:18.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
get your mum to write down
her chutney recipe.

321
00:14:18.445 --> 00:14:20.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will do. She'll be made up with that.

322
00:14:20.285 --> 00:14:21.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, Rubes.

323
00:14:21.445 --> 00:14:22.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks.

324
00:14:23.245 --> 00:14:24.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Phew.

325
00:14:28.805 --> 00:14:31.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The pastry's okay in places.
Some of them are quite soggy there.

326
00:14:31.565 --> 00:14:32.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

327
00:14:37.685 --> 00:14:39.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm. The chicken pesto, it's delicious.

328
00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:41.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah? Oh, thank you.

329
00:14:41.845 --> 00:14:43.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't think that would work.

330
00:14:43.485 --> 00:14:45.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Your sweet one. Interesting.
-[Jon] The jam might need a spoon.

331
00:14:45.765 --> 00:14:46.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

332
00:14:47.045 --> 00:14:48.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not so much a dipping

333
00:14:48.405 --> 00:14:50.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but bit more of a--
-It's not a dip, it's a smear.

334
00:14:52.165 --> 00:14:53.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour's great.

335
00:14:53.285 --> 00:14:55.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
You've got the orange,
the crème pât. Beautiful.

336
00:14:59.925 --> 00:15:01.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-[Prue] So beautiful.
-[Sandi] So beautiful.

337
00:15:01.445 --> 00:15:02.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Briony] Thank you.
-You can hardly bear to eat them.

338
00:15:09.445 --> 00:15:10.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the pastry's perfect, actually,

339
00:15:11.005 --> 00:15:12.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the texture,

340
00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because you've got the nut in there
as well and the beetroot.

341
00:15:14.645 --> 00:15:17.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] But the sweet one is too gluey.
-[Briony] Okay.

342
00:15:17.205 --> 00:15:19.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Peanut butter, you always-- It always is.
-Yeah.

343
00:15:20.125 --> 00:15:22.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But great job. I mean, best looking
samosa I think I've ever seen.

344
00:15:22.925 --> 00:15:23.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

345
00:15:29.045 --> 00:15:34.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I have never had a samosa
with a Pythagoras theorem on...

346
00:15:36.765 --> 00:15:37.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm.

347
00:15:37.965 --> 00:15:40.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The pastry is beautiful and light.
Very traditional flavours.

348
00:15:41.005 --> 00:15:44.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's almost like you're,
you're missing something.

349
00:15:44.325 --> 00:15:48.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is it spicy enough? 'Cause I thought
it might need a bit more chilli.

350
00:15:48.565 --> 00:15:49.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That would have helped.

351
00:15:49.685 --> 00:15:53.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I must say, the apple chai samosa
is absolutely lovely.

352
00:15:53.405 --> 00:15:54.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Thank you very much.

353
00:16:06.725 --> 00:16:07.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

354
00:16:07.765 --> 00:16:08.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think we know where we're going here.

355
00:16:09.325 --> 00:16:10.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

356
00:16:12.485 --> 00:16:13.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bit tough, Prue?

357
00:16:14.405 --> 00:16:15.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] How could you guess that?

358
00:16:15.605 --> 00:16:17.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just a bit. Just a bit.
-[all laughing]

359
00:16:18.965 --> 00:16:21.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, Dan, taste that.
-[Dan] Goodness me.

360
00:16:24.485 --> 00:16:25.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sarcastically] Wonderfully soft.

361
00:16:25.445 --> 00:16:27.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you lie your face goes red.
You know, you got that.

362
00:16:27.405 --> 00:16:28.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both laughing]

363
00:16:28.845 --> 00:16:32.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It seems to be absolutely about
too much water in the pastry.

364
00:16:32.445 --> 00:16:33.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's gone more like a bread. See?

365
00:16:34.365 --> 00:16:35.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm-hmm.

366
00:16:35.685 --> 00:16:38.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are both like leather
but the fillings are beautiful.

367
00:16:38.485 --> 00:16:39.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Well, that's one out of two.

368
00:16:46.085 --> 00:16:48.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] I love this little pattern
you've got on the top.

369
00:16:48.685 --> 00:16:50.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look quite authentic, don't they?

370
00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:07.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rahul, if I tell you that
they are absolutely delicious quickly,

371
00:17:07.685 --> 00:17:09.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
will you start looking happier?

372
00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:12.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Great flavours.
What it is, is the texture.

373
00:17:12.604 --> 00:17:14.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got the nut, the flavours,
the spices...

374
00:17:14.685 --> 00:17:16.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, Rahul.
-...and that with the raita as well,

375
00:17:16.324 --> 00:17:17.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's that cooling effect.

376
00:17:17.405 --> 00:17:19.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The whole thing together
'cause the pastry is beautifully crispy,

377
00:17:19.925 --> 00:17:21.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it almost melts in the mouth.

378
00:17:21.405 --> 00:17:24.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sweet one.
The oil in the coconut is so moist.

379
00:17:24.925 --> 00:17:26.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's absolutely faultless.

380
00:17:26.725 --> 00:17:27.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi laughing]

381
00:17:27.725 --> 00:17:30.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If he doesn't put his hand out
and give you a handshake,

382
00:17:30.485 --> 00:17:31.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going to kill him.

383
00:17:31.725 --> 00:17:33.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's okay. It's fine.
If you like it, that's...

384
00:17:33.405 --> 00:17:34.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. Death or shake?

385
00:17:36.565 --> 00:17:37.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

386
00:17:43.765 --> 00:17:45.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, your mother would be
very proud of them.

387
00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:47.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I'm stressed a bit.

388
00:17:52.885 --> 00:17:54.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] The pastry's a little bit thick
on the top.

389
00:17:54.965 --> 00:17:55.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

390
00:17:55.965 --> 00:17:57.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's split a bit on a couple there.
-Mm.

391
00:18:03.885 --> 00:18:06.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is much more potato
than there is chicken,

392
00:18:06.565 --> 00:18:09.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so the chicken has a hard time
coming forward.

393
00:18:09.205 --> 00:18:10.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-[Paul] The sweet one.

394
00:18:10.645 --> 00:18:12.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just think it's a little bit too dry.

395
00:18:12.485 --> 00:18:13.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-You do get the apple

396
00:18:14.085 --> 00:18:15.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but you need that caramel

397
00:18:15.565 --> 00:18:18.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and that caramel's too thick
as a dipping sauce.

398
00:18:18.085 --> 00:18:19.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is disappointing.

399
00:18:21.525 --> 00:18:23.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not like Manon to miss flavour.

400
00:18:26.085 --> 00:18:27.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anybody's game this week.

401
00:18:27.245 --> 00:18:29.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know, mate, I know. I know.

402
00:18:34.365 --> 00:18:36.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Manon] Not very happy with that.

403
00:18:36.685 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmph. I have to do good later today.

404
00:18:39.925 --> 00:18:42.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's good to get appreciated
by Paul Hollywood

405
00:18:42.325 --> 00:18:45.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the way he does it by, you know,
shaking your hand.

406
00:18:45.725 --> 00:18:46.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

407
00:18:47.565 --> 00:18:50.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel sorry for Paul.
My hand was probably sweaty.

408
00:18:50.125 --> 00:18:52.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I probably clammy hands
when he gave me a handshake.

409
00:18:52.285 --> 00:18:54.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That wasn't good. I should have
had a towel just to quickly...

410
00:18:55.445 --> 00:18:57.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, to be honest,
I wasn't expecting that at all.

411
00:18:57.845 --> 00:19:00.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow. I'm so happy that
I finally produced a signature

412
00:19:00.645 --> 00:19:02.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
where they've gone,

00:20:16.845 --> 00:20:18.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I haven't heard of it, mate.
I've got no idea what I'm making.

00:20:19.005 --> 00:20:21.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm a really bad French
because I'm sure a lot of people

440
00:20:21.365 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

443
00:20:29.925 --> 00:20:32.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:39.125 --> 00:20:40.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to be honest with you.

448
00:20:43.085 --> 00:20:44.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:49.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Why have you chosen
these beautiful pastries?

451
00:20:49.485 --> 00:20:51.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, mainly because
they're quite difficult.

452
00:20:51.445 --> 00:20:55.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are five elements to this
and they have to get them all right.

453
00:20:55.125 --> 00:20:57.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
First of all you have to make
a puff pastry.

454
00:20:57.365 --> 00:20:59.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's really important to get the layers.

455
00:20:59.685 --> 00:21:01.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you want to keep that cold.

456
00:21:01.765 --> 00:21:05.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then they have to pipe a perfect ring
of choux pastry

457
00:21:05.605 --> 00:21:09.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but in the meantime they make
the compote and the crème pât,

458
00:21:09.325 --> 00:21:11.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which they blowtorch to a caramel.

459
00:21:11.365 --> 00:21:14.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul chuckles] Right,
I've gotta try one of these.

460
00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:18.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hate to think we've got to eat
seven of these.

461
00:21:18.165 --> 00:21:19.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hate?

462
00:21:19.125 --> 00:21:20.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The trouble
is I'll eat them all. [chuckles]

463
00:21:20.605 --> 00:21:21.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bring it on.

464
00:21:25.645 --> 00:21:28.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Haven't had the best start of the day,

465
00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:32.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so, I need to do well. Yeah.

466
00:21:32.445 --> 00:21:34.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

really detailed instructions.

469

470
00:21:39.565 --> 00:21:40.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't want to melt the butter.

471
00:21:41.085 --> 00:21:42.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

472
00:21:43.285 --> 00:21:44.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

how come you've never heard of it?

00:21:53.325 --> 00:21:54.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know. I've spent too long in England.

477
00:21:55.005 --> 00:21:56.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you'll be here forever?

478
00:21:56.245 --> 00:21:58.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

an English husband, yeah.

481
00:22:02.045 --> 00:22:03.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've tried? What? No takers?

482
00:22:04.725 --> 00:22:06.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow. I think
you're gonna get some letters.

483
00:22:09.605 --> 00:22:11.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love working with puff pastry.

484
00:22:11.565 --> 00:22:13.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Love all the rolling and folding.

485
00:22:14.565 --> 00:22:17.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The folding is a technique that you'd do
to get the layers.

486
00:22:20.325 --> 00:22:21.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tac-tac-tac.

487
00:22:22.045 --> 00:22:26.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm doing a book fold, erm,
which creates four layers.

488

Oh, my God.
Why do you have to start with that?

490
00:22:31.205 --> 00:22:32.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Noel did the same thing.

491
00:22:32.285 --> 00:22:33.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you never pleased?

492
00:22:34.525 --> 00:22:36.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What happened with Paul,
did you get a handshake?

493
00:22:36.365 --> 00:22:38.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. No. They were really
complimentary though.

494
00:22:38.645 --> 00:22:40.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul said they were the best samosas

-Paul Hollywood.

496
00:22:42.125 --> 00:22:43.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah. I like that guy.

497
00:22:43.485 --> 00:22:44.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, he's all right.

498
00:22:44.405 --> 00:22:46.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can he bake?
-Been around a while-- I think he can.

499
00:22:46.885 --> 00:22:48.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prue's the one you want to watch out for.

500
00:22:48.605 --> 00:22:49.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, she's trouble.

501
00:22:52.605 --> 00:22:55.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It just says, "Make the compote,"
and then the crème pât.

502
00:22:56.605 --> 00:22:57.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, okay.

503
00:22:58.165 --> 00:22:59.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] So the compote's okay.

504
00:22:59.965 --> 00:23:02.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I'm fairly confident
of the crème pât.

505
00:23:02.445 --> 00:23:04.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] This is crème pât ingredients.

506
00:23:04.765 --> 00:23:06.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So when you have finished
separating your eggs,

507
00:23:06.365 --> 00:23:08.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you've got these lovely egg whites,
never let them go

508
00:23:08.565 --> 00:23:10.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause there's good protein in there.

509
00:23:12.485 --> 00:23:14.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm. Reminds me of <i>Rocky.</i>

510
00:23:17.005 --> 00:23:19.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ruby] Is that looking as good?
Looking as everyone else's?

511
00:23:19.845 --> 00:23:22.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This eggs and milk and a bit of butter.

512
00:23:22.125 --> 00:23:23.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] You heat it until it burps.

513
00:23:23.685 --> 00:23:24.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You gonna burp?

514
00:23:25.565 --> 00:23:26.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, not yet.

515
00:23:26.925 --> 00:23:27.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Do you think that's thick enough?

516
00:23:28.005 --> 00:23:29.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] I think that's thick enough

517
00:23:29.365 --> 00:23:33.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I have no idea what it is,

00:24:08.245 --> 00:24:10.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

It's not that I don't wanna to help you,

00:24:46.245 --> 00:24:47.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

542
00:24:48.245 --> 00:24:49.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:29.645 --> 00:25:32.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna check after 15

557
00:25:32.445 --> 00:25:33.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:39.245 --> 00:25:41.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

561
00:25:43.845 --> 00:25:45.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that will stop the choux from rising.

562
00:25:45.765 --> 00:25:46.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

563
00:25:48.445 --> 00:25:49.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I think the choux pastry was a little bit
too soft when it was piped out.

959
00:44:23.605 --> 00:44:24.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Little bottles of port, I would never
bribe the judges with alcohol.

966
00:44:44.165 --> 00:44:45.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

969
00:44:51.925 --> 00:44:52.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Damn it. Mine's leaking tons.
Didn't have time to chill all my butter.

973
00:45:03.965 --> 00:45:05.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Manon] So, there's some juice
that's so annoying.

974
00:45:05.885 --> 00:45:07.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God, that looks so a mess.

975
00:45:07.285 --> 00:45:08.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

He's a bit of a baby, isn't he?

977
00:45:11.365 --> 00:45:14.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know size doesn't matter
but it's a banquet.

978
00:45:14.285 --> 00:45:16.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're talking to the wrong person
about size.

979
00:45:21.805 --> 00:45:24.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I literally can't turn the oven up
any hotter.

980
00:45:24.165 --> 00:45:25.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

981
00:45:25.805 --> 00:45:27.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is stuck on the bottom.

982
00:45:28.325 --> 00:45:30.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't really understand.

983
00:45:31.325 --> 00:45:34.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have one minute left.
One minute remaining.

984
00:45:34.405 --> 00:45:37.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If your pie is still in the oven
it will need to come out now.

985
00:45:37.965 --> 00:45:39.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, great.

986
00:45:39.365 --> 00:45:42.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I'm just gonna spray it
in some colour so it's more inventive.

987
00:45:42.485 --> 00:45:45.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe Alice's feet could do
with a little touch-up.

988
00:45:46.645 --> 00:45:47.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:45:54.045 --> 00:45:54.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:45:58.405 --> 00:46:00.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, my lovelies, time is up.

994
00:46:03.085 --> 00:46:04.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

995
00:46:04.605 --> 00:46:05.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Hopefully that cooked through.

997
00:46:11.005 --> 00:46:11.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't worry, darling.

998
00:46:11.925 --> 00:46:15.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I still have some baking paper underneath.
It's so bad.

00:46:17.645 --> 00:46:18.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:46:20.245 --> 00:46:21.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:47:07.845 --> 00:47:09.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It looks great

1010
00:47:10.045 --> 00:47:11.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you can see by the flakes in that.

1011
00:47:14.085 --> 00:47:17.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But there's quite a big spot of dough
there where it's extra thick,

1012
00:47:17.605 --> 00:47:19.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

The beetroot works and everything works
but it's just that pastry's too soggy.

of soaking in all the juices

00:48:08.165 --> 00:48:10.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That with the curry together

1025
00:48:10.565 --> 00:48:11.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:48:29.565 --> 00:48:32.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I put only two little steam holes,
I should have put more.

1031
00:48:36.125 --> 00:48:37.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Wh-- Oh, let's get
into the reality of this.

[all laughing]

1039
00:48:58.805 --> 00:49:02.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a monster sausage roll, isn't it?

1040
00:49:08.805 --> 00:49:10.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It tastes delicious.

1041
00:49:11.085 --> 00:49:12.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's really wet.

1042
00:49:13.085 --> 00:49:14.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is full butter puff pastry.

1043
00:49:14.965 --> 00:49:17.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all about the chilling process
to get a bit of flake butteriness

1044
00:49:17.925 --> 00:49:19.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you never thought that through.

1045
00:49:19.245 --> 00:49:22.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Time constraints with everything else
was my problem.

1046
00:49:29.925 --> 00:49:32.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Looks more like a monkfish
than it does a salmon, doesn't it?

1047
00:49:32.765 --> 00:49:34.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks great though.

1048
00:49:34.525 --> 00:49:36.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know we had this conversation before

1049
00:49:36.445 --> 00:49:40.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but my reaction is just that
it doesn't look appetising.

1050
00:49:40.125 --> 00:49:43.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't want to eat it
partly because it's so good.

1051
00:49:43.525 --> 00:49:46.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks like a great raw fish
sitting there.

1052
00:49:46.245 --> 00:49:47.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Feel like it needs cooking.

1053
00:49:47.405 --> 00:49:48.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1054
00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:49.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does it?

1055
00:49:49.925 --> 00:49:50.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite possibly.

1056
00:49:53.325 --> 00:49:54.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckling]

1057
00:49:54.565 --> 00:49:55.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's raw all the way around.

1058
00:49:57.605 --> 00:49:59.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It could have been a bit of dough,
you know what I mean, anything.

1059
00:50:02.645 --> 00:50:04.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The fish is a lovely flavour,

1060
00:50:05.285 --> 00:50:07.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
coriander pancakes delicious too.

1061
00:50:07.685 --> 00:50:09.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But this is about pastry,
it's about a celebration of pastry.

1062
00:50:09.725 --> 00:50:10.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Yeah, I know.

1063
00:50:10.685 --> 00:50:12.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And that is not a celebration of pastry.
-No, it isn't.

1064
00:50:13.765 --> 00:50:16.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's clever. The idea's sound enough
and I do like the look of it.

1065
00:50:17.005 --> 00:50:18.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Thank you very much, Dan.
-Thank you.

1066
00:50:24.605 --> 00:50:26.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] You wouldn't know
unless you said that's an octopus.

1067
00:50:27.085 --> 00:50:29.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you'd opened it up a bit
and really elaborated on the fact

1068
00:50:29.645 --> 00:50:31.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that they are tentacles,
it would have looked more effective.

1069
00:50:35.645 --> 00:50:38.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is a bit of baking paper underneath.

1070
00:50:39.085 --> 00:50:40.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's on baking paper?

1071
00:50:42.965 --> 00:50:44.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-'Cause it got stuck?
-Yes.

1072
00:50:45.325 --> 00:50:46.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I'm taking the paper with me.

1073
00:50:54.965 --> 00:50:56.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-See that underneath Prue?
-[Prue] Hm-mm.

1074
00:50:56.765 --> 00:50:57.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It needed longer.

1075
00:51:02.005 --> 00:51:03.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm, a bit too much salt.

1076
00:51:03.925 --> 00:51:05.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's very salty, isn't it?
-Hmm.

1077
00:51:05.725 --> 00:51:07.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's too salty,
it's a little bit dry.

1078
00:51:08.125 --> 00:51:11.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry needed more baking
and the fish needed less cooking.

1079
00:51:22.005 --> 00:51:24.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You are a dark horse, aren't you?
-[laughs]

1080
00:51:24.485 --> 00:51:26.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's absolutely wonderful.
-Thank you.

1081
00:51:27.085 --> 00:51:29.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The little intricate pieces of work
looks very clever.

1082
00:51:29.805 --> 00:51:32.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that's playable croquet
with the little flamingos.

1083
00:51:32.605 --> 00:51:33.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Oh, look there's the hedgehog.

1084
00:51:33.725 --> 00:51:34.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Briony] There's the hedgehog ball
and he'll go through the little--

1085
00:51:35.005 --> 00:51:36.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, here we come.

1086
00:51:37.525 --> 00:51:38.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Briony cheers and laughs]

1087
00:51:39.605 --> 00:51:40.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
You missed.

1088
00:51:42.125 --> 00:51:44.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Okay, I think the baking of it
is very good.

1089
00:51:44.485 --> 00:51:46.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Thank you.
-I hold reservation,

1090
00:51:46.885 --> 00:51:49.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because you've got game in there as well

1091
00:51:49.085 --> 00:51:51.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's notorious for flooding out
when you cut it.

1092
00:51:51.725 --> 00:51:53.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, I know,
I am a bit nervous about that.

1093
00:51:58.685 --> 00:52:00.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Well done.
[Prue] Look at that.

1094
00:52:00.605 --> 00:52:02.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Well done.
-[exhales and laughs]

1095
00:52:02.845 --> 00:52:03.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Oh, my God.

1096
00:52:10.405 --> 00:52:12.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is this sweet potato?
-[Briony] Yes.

1097
00:52:12.125 --> 00:52:13.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I would have had much more of it.

1098
00:52:13.805 --> 00:52:16.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I... Yeah.
-That much venison is quite an ask.

1099
00:52:16.645 --> 00:52:17.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Glass of port? Port?
-Yes, please.

1100
00:52:21.925 --> 00:52:22.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's my girl.

1101
00:52:24.285 --> 00:52:27.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is pure Prue. Port, venison, croquet.

1102

00:52:29.325 --> 00:52:30.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am happy.

1104
00:52:30.605 --> 00:52:32.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And very slightly Mad Hatter-y.

1105
00:52:32.405 --> 00:52:33.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to stop the show,

1115
00:53:08.885 --> 00:53:10.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it looked fantastic.

The whole of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>

00:53:16.165 --> 00:53:17.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And a pie in the shape of a hat's
funny, right?

1119
00:53:17.565 --> 00:53:19.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is and I think she's in line
for star baker.

1120
00:53:20.285 --> 00:53:22.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1121
00:53:22.765 --> 00:53:24.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

with the pie...

1122
00:53:24.725 --> 00:53:25.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Ruby's filling, didn't you?

00:53:29.565 --> 00:53:31.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:53:31.645 --> 00:53:33.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1126
00:53:33.165 --> 00:53:35.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Has she saved herself
enough to be star baker

1127
00:53:35.445 --> 00:53:37.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or not quite that much?

1128
00:53:37.165 --> 00:53:40.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn't-- You see, I wouldn't discount
her from star baker.

1129
00:53:40.605 --> 00:53:42.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1130
00:53:42.125 --> 00:53:44.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Too much sea salt in the octopus?

1131
00:53:45.805 --> 00:53:48.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, that was the one filling
that was badly flavoured

1132
00:53:48.685 --> 00:53:50.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it was overcooked.

1133
00:53:50.245 --> 00:53:51.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She is certainly in the danger zone.

1134
00:53:51.965 --> 00:53:53.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:53:54.085 --> 00:53:57.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's have a look at the, er, salmon,
'cause I mean it does look sort of broad.

1136
00:53:57.685 --> 00:53:59.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's part of the fun,
it's almost like an illusion cake,

1137
00:53:59.925 --> 00:54:01.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you know, and he's made like a real fish.

1138
00:54:01.965 --> 00:54:03.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1139
00:54:03.085 --> 00:54:04.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:54:04.725 --> 00:54:07.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

and so up there for weeks.

00:54:08.485 --> 00:54:11.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He just occasionally does things
where you think, "Wow."

Right, bakers,

1145
00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:32.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1146
00:54:33.165 --> 00:54:35.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has been a stellar performance

1147
00:54:35.565 --> 00:54:37.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1148
00:54:37.405 --> 00:54:41.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:54:52.645 --> 00:54:56.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unfortunately, that leaves me
with the horrible job

00:55:02.325 --> 00:55:03.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

It was a disastrous week though,
wasn't it?

1164
00:55:23.485 --> 00:55:25.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really sorry for you.
I think you're an incredible baker.

1165
00:55:25.685 --> 00:55:26.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am.

1166
00:55:26.925 --> 00:55:28.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, well, that was expected, wasn't it?

1167
00:55:28.845 --> 00:55:30.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It didn't take Nostradamus
to see that coming.

1172
00:55:38.405 --> 00:55:41.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
sometimes you don't get to feel
very sort of special or important,

00:55:41.085 --> 00:55:43.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it's been quite nice to...

1174
00:55:43.085 --> 00:55:45.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's been quite nice to do
something for me.

00:55:47.205 --> 00:55:48.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Oh, Dan.

1176
00:55:48.525 --> 00:55:50.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it was a bit of a mess though,
wasn't it?

1177
00:55:50.485 --> 00:55:54.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It was a bit, but it's such a pity
because you're such a good baker.

I think, sometimes,
pastry can be quite tricky

00:55:58.565 --> 00:56:01.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

was Dan's Achilles heel.
