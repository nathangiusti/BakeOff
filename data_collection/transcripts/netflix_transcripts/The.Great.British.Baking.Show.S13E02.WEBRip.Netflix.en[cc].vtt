34
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, not many people know this about me,

35
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but at midnight, I like to get naked,
glue feathers onto myself,

and put Party Rings in my eyes

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For today's Signature challenge,

40
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the judges would like you to bake
12 slice-and-bake biscuits.

41
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll be doing this
by shaping the dough into an oblong

42
00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so that when you slice into it,
it reveals a picture or a design.

43
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-Bake.

46
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

47
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Biscuit time. Whoa.

48
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Let's hope it will be tasty,
especially after last week.

49
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Little bit nervous. Drama queen. Ah!

50
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I'm not gonna worry today.
No worries. Uh-uh. Oh, no.

51
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Today's Signature challenge
is a slice-and-bake biscuit.

52
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Normally, when you make a biscuit,
you make your paste which you roll up,

53
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
pop in the fridge to chill,
slice, and then bake it.

54
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the difference is,
we want them to hide a big design inside.

55
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But we don't want a simple pattern
like a chequerboard.

56
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We want a picture.

57
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So the shaping is going to be difficult

58
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the bakers
really have to think ahead.

59
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're making something
which will only show up as the picture

60
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when you slice it.

61
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They'll have to make
lots of different colours

62
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and think in a 3-D way,

63
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that is extremely difficult to do.

64
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But this biscuit has another problem.
It needs to have a snap.

65
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But once you add colour to a biscuit,
it's difficult to know when it's baked.

66
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] They won't want it
to be in there too long

67
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because they don't want it to go brown.
That'll spoil their pattern.

68
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] If they go too far
and try to impress us too much,

69
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they'll run out of time.

70
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You may lose the overall pattern,

71
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you may start panicking,
underbake it, overbake it.

72
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Keep it simple
and make sure the bake is correct.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the flavour of the biscuit
should be Turkish spices.

484
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite delicately spiced,
but I think it's really delicious.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

with less filling and a longer bake.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

weirdly, it adds to the malt.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They picked up on the chocolate,

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

the same feedback, "underbaked",

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is good, because I was nervous
they were gonna be overbaked.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

that when you dunk it at least four times,

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

of the caramel.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just to give them

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

before they bake them.

597
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if you try to cut a sheet of hobnob,
it'll just fall to bits.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

601
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna put the golden syrup in now.

617
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Put the oats in, flour in.

618
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Nataliia] Mix, mix, mix, mix.

619
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Nadia] I've got to make 12,

620
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'm gonna roll it out
on some parchment.

621
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pressing down on this ring mould.
I just want them to be even.

622
00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hopefully, I can get two more out of this.
I'm kind of short right now.

623
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Hello, Tom.
-Oh, hello.

624
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How did the judging go? No handshakes?
-[Tom] Don't think we've seen one yet.

625
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What would you do
if you got a Hollywood handshake?

626
00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who would you phone first?

627
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It'd be my boyfriend to say,

628
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"If it goes any further,
are we okay with it?"

629
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

630
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This doesn't look right.

631
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm thinking, bake the whole thing first
and then cut,

632
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or mould them with the cutter and bake?

633
00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No idea.

634
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Managed to cut out nine.

635
00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just re-rolling the scraps
to get the remaining three.

636
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Toby] Look all right so far.

637
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite crumbly.
Got a feeling I've done this all wrong.

638
00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very dry. Doesn't stick together.

639
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know what?
I'll just bake it like that and then cut.

640
00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No idea how long I'm putting them in for.
-I'm gonna put mine in for 16 minutes.

641
00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Twelve minutes?
-[beeps]

642
00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Make the caramel."

643
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna do a dry caramel.
The risk is you can burn it very easily.

644
00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] You just heat up sugar, don't you?
-And then?

645
00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then put one of those
temperature things in.

646
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The only time I've ever used
a temperature probe is when someone's ill.

647
00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Why is it not called a thermometer?

648
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Jasmine] Yeah, a thermometer…
-"Probe" is implying it's gonna…

649
00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoop! "You're very hot."

650
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ooh, up the nose.
-[laughs]

651
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Aaron] I wanna take the temperature
of this caramel.

652
00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although, I don't know if she meant
use the probe for the caramel

653
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or for the chocolate.

654
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't remember how to make caramel.

655
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm guessing. [laughs]

656
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Toby] You shouldn't stir it
until it's caramelised

657
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the caramelisation
changes the structure

658
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and stops it crystallising.

659
00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stressful this is, isn't it?
-[Pui Man laughs]

660
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You ever made a hobnob before?
-Never. But I buy them all the time.

661
00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Who do you buy them for then?
-My kids.

662
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How many kids you got?
-Two.

663
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, a boy and a girl?
-One girl, one boy.

664
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, boy and a girl? [laughs]
-Yeah, boy and girl. [laughs]

665
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Caramel looks nice. It's very smooth.

666
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is not right.

667
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must start again.

668
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I don't know what happened.

669
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll need to do another caramel.

670
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just a few seconds,
and it goes from caramel to burn.

671
00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When it's Biscuit Week,

672
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
why is it not the biscuit
that's the hard part?

673
00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you are halfway through.
You've got one hour left.

674
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lesley] My biscuits are awful.

675
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[beeping]
-I'm bringing them out. I'm coming out.

676
00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Toby] Whoa! They have spread like crazy.

677
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[groans]

678
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They seem okay.
They seem cooked to the right crunch.

679
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna have to cut them. Needs must.

680
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Pui Man] I don't have enough.

681
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not 12. [laughs]

682
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How many have you got? Ten. Oh, gosh.

683
00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I reckon you could do another two
out of this.

684
00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I join them together in the mould,
should be okay. [laughs]

685
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You need to do something.
-[laughs]

686
00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Make the caramel." Done.

687
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"And then spoon some
into the silicon moulds."

688
00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Spoon some." How many is some?

689
00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It says, "This makes more than you need",
so it's a bit of a trip-up.

690
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>Put too much caramel</i>

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Nadia] She only wants a thin layer.

692
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tom] Doing a random tablespoon.
For some reason, that feels right.

694
00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Leighton] A little bit thick.

695
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you're my good luck charm
because this is actually working.

696
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am actually an angel.
You'll that find out.

697
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You'll go, "Noel was good this year",

698
00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and everyone'll go,

699
00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"There's no one called Noel.
I don't know what you're talking about."

700
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think we did it.

701
00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm pouring this into the mould,
chucking the mould in the freezer.

702
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How much caramel do you give it?
-[Aaron] Enough that they can taste it.

703
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Leighton] I'm trying to spread it.

704
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can't be cheated out of caramel.

705
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What have I done? [exhales]

706
00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Try again, try again, try again.

707
00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can we get a time check?
-You have half an hour left.

708
00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[clicks tongue] Oh.

709
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So step four is, "Place a biscuit
on top of the caramel".

710
00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Toby] The cutting and stuffing technique
is actually working.

712
00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Didn't you win the Technical?

713
00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I won the Technical last week.
-You're a Technical whizz-kid.

714
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I was the Technical whizz-kid once.

715
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

A little bit worried.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna chill them in the freezer

717
00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

745
00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

It's not set. It won't come out.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going to dip the biscuits upside down

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Toby] Considering how bad they looked
out of the oven,

749
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't feel that awful about them.

750
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need to put some chocolate on.

751
00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you feather, the under chocolate
should be slightly melted.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Think this is what you do
to make a bit of feathering.

754
00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

757
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

758
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lesley] Oh, no. This is awful.

760
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

some brownie points.

766
00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

767
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like Russian roulette.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it really is important
because that biscuit isn't very thick.

799
00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

801
00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

802
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They're all odd shaped.
It's not very consistent, is it?

803
00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] And too much caramel.

804
00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Tastes okay, but too much caramel
and the chocolate's all over the place.

805
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How can you do
two centimetres of decoration

806
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and try and feather that?

807
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-You'd need a machete.

808
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's everything. Caramel, biscuit.
Everything's too thick.

809
00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

810
00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] In fact, the caramel layer
is thicker than the biscuit.

811
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Now there is feathering on this.

812
00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's still
not very delicate, though.

813
00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now that's not too bad. Look,
that is a nice, thin layer of caramel.

814
00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is. The balance between the three,
chocolate, caramel and biscuit, is good.

815
00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] These are much more delicate.

816
00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's sort of been smeared.
It's not really feathered.

817
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's thin, though.
-[Prue] Really thin. I like that.

818
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Paul] Yeah.

819
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's three times
as much biscuit as caramel.

820
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then, about the same amount
of caramel as chocolate.

821
00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:38.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

quite thick.

Chocolate's quite thick on that.
It's not the caramel or the biscuit.

It's a bit uneven.
Because the biscuit is slightly domed,

827
00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

nice and thin in the middle.

It's the same thickness as a biscuit.

[Paul] That's why it's so thick.
It's like a millionaire's shortbread.

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was concerned
when you told me what you were doing,

1346
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Tricky to do a macaron like that.
-[Prue] It's all quite complicated.

1355
00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I flavoured my box

00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

They are white chocolate,
and then, a Chantilly cream.

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's chocolate orange biscuit

To try and give it a bit more structure,
I twice baked the biscuit.

1370
00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's almond shortbread

1376
00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I found the almond one boring,
and it's not quite baked enough.

1377
00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is a classic example
of style over substance.

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

it's a tiny bit hard.
