69
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

is 24 identical, perfect brandy snaps.

71
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

is to get your brandy snap quite lacy.

74
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's about a crispy brandy snap
and a beautifully soft interior.

77
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

there's going to be a danger

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue] Hello, Freya.
-Hi.

425
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I think they look absolutely scrumptious.

426
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, thank you.

427
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They do look quite dark.
Have you got coffee in the snaps?

428
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, little bit of coffee liqueur.

429
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Nice lace on it though.
-[Prue] A good snap on top.

430
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm, nice flavour.

431
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Quite strong coffee,
maybe even a tiny bit too strong.

432
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How many espressos did you put in there?

433
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Eight tablespoons.
-Sorry?

434
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Eight tablespoons?
-I like a lot of coffee.

435
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You needed waking up.
You were steaming drunk last night.

436
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not that bad. I love it.

437
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me, it's just
a little bit too much coffee,

438
00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but overall, I think
you've done a decent job.

439
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much.

440
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
You made your brandy snaps
with the cold method?

441
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Amanda] I did.

442
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They're very thin
so therefore they're very delicate.

443
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The whole shape of it is falling apart.

444
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the flavour is absolutely delicious.

445
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Stem ginger with the sesame seed…

447
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm.
-[Prue] It's really lovely.

448
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would like to just squinch that up,
'cause it doesn't look very good,

449
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and have it for pudding.

450
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You would, wouldn't you?
-Oh, I would.

451
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

452
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Told you he liked ginger, didn't I?

453
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You did.
-[Matt] Yeah.

454
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] They're a little bit messy.

455
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The laid-back thing, I'm beginning
to see this in some of your work.

456
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jairzeno] There was a bit of rushing
in the last 15 minutes, so…

457
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] We've had that before, haven't we?
-We have.

458
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't think the chocolate would go
with those fruit flavours, but it does.

459
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just think that
the flavours are too strong.

460
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh.
-I mean, I couldn't eat a whole one.

461
00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The idea was sound, but not well-executed.

462
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

463
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-[Paul] Massive variety in size.
-I did weigh them out so I'm not sure.

464
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Some of them
are longer than the others.

465
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've got the Irish cream, coffee,
chocolate and hazelnut.

466
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think it's delicious.
-[Prue] And some booze.

467
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I added an extra tablespoon.
Thought you might like that.

468
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're right. You've got me in one.
Well done, Rochica.

469
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-[Prue] Hello, George.
-Hello.

470
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bit irregular in size. Every one of them.

471
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

472
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

473
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's mastika.
-[Paul] Orange blossom and mastika.

474
00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

475
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My issue is they just look a mess.

476
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm a perfectionist,
and I really dislike serving that up.

477
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

478
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should take comfort in the fact
that they are original and sensational.

479
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I saw you saying a little prayer then.

485
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I was absolutely panicking. [laughs]

486
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

487
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That lovely crunch
from the crumble and the apples

488
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with that little hint of cinnamon.

489
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've done well with the flavours.
-[Prue] And the textures.

490
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

491
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] What's that on the top?

492
00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
That's the fast food
clagginess that you get.

493
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The congealed stuff.

494
00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, delicious.

495
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I don't know
how to make it sound nice.

496
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, don't say "congealed."
-They're the words that come to me head.

497
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] There's very little lace in there.
-Yeah.

498
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it is delicious. That does
taste of apple. It tastes of brandy.

499
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] The crème diplomat's nice.
-Altogether it's a lovely mouthful.

500
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you very much.
-Ta.

501
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] That's really pretty.

502
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think they look very elegant,
pretty uniform in colour,

503
00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
nice lace as well in the brandy snap.

504
00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's see what it tastes like.

505
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The brandy snap is delicious,
crisp, nicely flavoured.

506
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Chocolate doesn't
come through massively strong.

507
00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what's happened is
it's sort of lost its way.

508
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You do get this blast of hazelnut,
but otherwise, you've done very well.

509
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Cheers, guys.
-[Prue] Well done.

510
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] They're nice and lacy.

511
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The chocolate comes through,
the brandy snap's got a lovely snap.

512
00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just the right amount of sweetness
in there as well.

513
00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cream's okay, but you've lost
a little bit of the coffee flavour.

514
00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's just a little bit weak.
-Fair enough.

515
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very good.
-Thank you very much.

516
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] They're very small

517
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
and they could have had
a more colour on them.

518
00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm really quite disappointed.

519
00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Because you've done a traditional…

520
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Maggie] Yes.
-…filled brandy snap.

521
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The cream has sogged up the brandy snap.
-Yes.

522
00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which weren't quite baked enough anyway
so they're really chewy.

523
00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Right.
-But they are delicious.

524
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I love the tanginess
from the blackcurrant,

525
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but, um, the practicalities really
haven't worked out very well.

526
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No indeed,
and that's what's disappointing.

527
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Onwards and upwards.
-[laughs]

528
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much.

529
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Overall, they look pretty good.

530
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Nice and even.
They are lovely and thin.

531
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[crunches]
-[Matt] I hear a crunch.

532
00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Mmm-hmm.
-I can.

533
00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The blend of the spices,

534
00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the cardamom and the cinnamon
work beautifully well.

535
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's so easy to get it wrong
by putting too much in,

536
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it overwhelms either the brandy snap
or the cream.

537
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it just doesn't. I think
texture-wise, you've done well as well.

538
00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The crème pat's perfect.
It's not too stodgy.

539
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think you've done well on that. Yeah.
-[Prue] Mmm.

540
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Thank you, Jürgen.

541
00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm just gonna try a bit myself.
-[Jürgen] Yes.

542
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It means nothing from me.
-It means a lot for me.

543
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, you can come back. Thank you.
-Welcome.

544
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] Couldn't have gone better.

545
00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was definitely worth
developing the spice chai crème pat.

546
00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which took a lot of time, was amazing.

547
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flavour's good. They liked the clagginess,
which is what I was after.

548
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe I should… I need a vocabulary.

549
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I can… Is it, not a vocabular…

550
00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's a diction… Like the diction…
Thesaurus, I need a thesaurus.

551
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We won't just expand on baking,
we'll expand my mind.

552
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] The comments were very positive
and, uh, very constructive.

553
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is a good step
in the right direction.

554
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prue used the word "sensational."

555
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In my head all I've got is,
uh, "they didn't look right."

556
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But she really liked it.

557
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jairzeno] The finish was rushed
because I was rushing at the end,

558
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so if I was judging, I would agree
with them about the messiness.

559
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it was a bit of a disaster, really.

560
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In the technical this afternoon.

561
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can only go up from here,
there is no going down.

562
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>Biscuit week isn't about to get</i>
<i>any easier for our 11 bakers</i>

563
00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>who now face a mystery</i>
<i>shrouded in gingham.</i>

564
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, it's time
for your technical challenge

565
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which today has been set by Paul.

566
00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Paul, any words of advice?
-[all chuckle]

567
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is pretty straightforward,
but read your recipe.

568
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We want perfection.

569
00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] As ever, this task is judged blind,

570
00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so we will ask Paul and Prue
to leave the tent.

571
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Bye-bye.

572
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What I don't understand

573
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is Paul's standing there,
scowling at everyone.

574
00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why doesn't he just tell 'em what to do?
-He's got a lot on his mind.

575
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like what?

576
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's deciding whether to watch
<i>Fast &amp; Furious 6</i> or <i>The Expendables 3.</i>

577
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laugh]

578
00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, for your technical challenge,

579
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul would like you
to make that childhood favourite,

580
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the sandwiched jammy biscuit.

581
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Made up of two perfectly-baked
short and tender biscuits,

582
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
perfectly set jam and smooth buttercream.

583
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We would like you to make 12 biscuits.

584
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have one hour and 45 minutes.

585
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] On your marks…
-Get set…

586
00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Bake.

587
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] I've had jam biscuits,
the sandwich ones.

588
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I know what I'm doing.
Just need to make sure they're perfect.

589
00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rochica] I've never made jammy biscuits,
but I have eaten them.

590
00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I kind of know what I'm looking for.

591
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amanda] Who makes biscuits
you can buy in the shop?

592
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can get a tub for 11p, can't you?

593
00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, jammy biscuits, why?

594
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think jammy biscuits should
be a very familiar biscuit to the bakers

595
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I thought it'd be a great challenge.

596
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The recipe is pretty straightforward,

597
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you gotta get
all the elements spot-on.

598
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've given the bakers stamps to get
that definition in those lines and swirls.

599
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And how you get the definition
is chilling the biscuit dough down.

600
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's soft when you press it,
you're going to lose that ridge.

601
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And obviously we're looking
for the same thickness.

602
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't want a thin top and a fat base.

603
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And what about texture?
Is it a shortbread?

604
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is. When you bite in,
you have that gorgeous biscuit

605
00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that snaps in the mouth
and that buttery flavour inside.

606
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See, the jam cuts the sweetness a bit.

607
00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's really lovely.
I thought this was a simple biscuit.

608
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's deceptively difficult.
It's quite a warm day.

609
00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all to do
with the temperature of the dough.

610
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They've gotta use the fridge.
-It's not that hot.

611
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, for you. You're South African.

612
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul said,
"Read the recipe very carefully."

613
00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm trying to ponder
on every single word.

614
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think he's taking the mickey when
he said read your instructions. That's it.

615
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They want you to be in the know-know,
but you don't know.

616
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The first thing to do is make
a smooth raspberry jam.

617
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Put the jam, sugar in there,
and all the raspberries.

618
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not a jam maker. I'm a jam eater.
I don't even eat that much jam, either.

619
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll leave that to heat up
and get all mushy.

620
00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm now just on to me biscuits
while me jam heats up.

621
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Next thing says, "Make the biscuit dough."

622
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Easy peasy.

623
00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Given the order
the ingredients are listed,

624
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the creaming method
will work best for this one.

625
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Freya] Ooh, bit fast.

626
00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the creaming
of the butter incorporates air.

627
00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Soon as that's light and fluffy
I'm gonna add the egg vanilla extract

628
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then I'm gonna sift the cornflour

629
00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the flour together
and then I'll put that in last.

630
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What does a tender biscuit mean?
I've heard of a short biscuit.

631
00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But a tender biscuit?

632
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I don't know what he's on about.

633
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sensitive biscuit. Sensitive, tender…
-Yeah. Yeah.

634
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Emotional.
-Bit like me.

635
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just concerned.
This batter's literally wet.

636
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want it to be a lot firmer.

637
00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because it's hot in here
the butter's really soft.

638
00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna chill it down for a bit.

639
00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got to rest it for a while
before it gets workable

640
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to get the butter solid again.

641
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's in there.

642
00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jam is almost at jam temperature.
I'm just gonna let that bubble.

643
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The setting point is about
105 degrees Celsius.

644
00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I reached that
and I did a setting test.

645
00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you put a drop of jam
onto the bowl, you nudge the drop,

646
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you get this kind of skin ripple,
that should be perfect.

647
00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rochica] Oh, no. I just burnt it.
I wasn't paying attention.

648
00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't use that.

649
00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just gonna start again.
And hopefully I won't burn this one.

650
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They want a smooth
raspberry jam, so no bits.

651
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] The jam should set,
fingers crossed.

652
00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] That is the amount
of jam I have. What?

653
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I cooked it to the jam temperature.
I think. Not very much, is it?

654
00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Bakers, you are halfway through.

655
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Freya] It says roll out the dough…
[Lizzie] Using the "fluttered…"

656
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that's how you pronounce it.

657
00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Use the fluted cutter
to create 24 rounds."

658
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fluted. Oh, okay. Fluted cutter.

659
00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[George] Is that fluted?

660
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That must be fluted,
'cause that's just round.

661
00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lizzie] Learn a new word every day.

662
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I can just about
get 12 biscuits on one sheet.

663
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] It's such a soft dough.

664
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have no idea
how I'm gonna cut out circles of this.

665
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Freya] It's so hot in here.
The butter's just completely melting.

666
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just gonna throw them
back in the freezer again.

667
00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm chilling the dough
to get it stiff enough to work with.

668
00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amanda] I'd like the dough to be harder.
It's still quite soft.

669
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just need to keep an eye on that jam
because I don't want to burn it again.

670
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gonna start rolling the dough out.

671
00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, "Make the buttercream."
Lots of detail, as always.

672
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's emphasised in the recipe, "smooth."
He's in smooth mode.

673
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] The longer you beat it,
the smoother it will become.

674
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna beat this
until the cows come home.

675
00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rochica gasps] Fluted. Oh, no.

676
00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've cut them round and not fluted.

677
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bakers, you have--
-Whoa, what are you doing?

678
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna tell 'em
how long they've got left.

679
00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, don't do that.
No spoilers, I'm watching the show.

680
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] I've gotta tell--
-[Matt] No, don't…

681
00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, cover your ears.

682
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

683
00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. No spoilers, please.

684
00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. I've got to go back to the biscuits.

685
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Amanda] It's quite cold.
-[Giuseppe] Set enough.

[Jürgen] "Using the biscuit stamp,
emboss the biscuits."

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ah, yes.
-[Lizzie] It is quite cool, isn't it?

688
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The biscuit dough was sticking
to the stamp, so I've floured it.

689
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

With a heart-shaped cutter,
stamp a single heart shape

out of the centre
of 12 of your stamped rounds.

692
00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're so soft I can't get it out.
It's like mashed potato.

[Crystelle] It's very soft, but I should
get them in the oven.

There is so much butter in there.

699
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you put it straight in the oven
the whole dough will collapse.

700
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But there's no definition in there at all.

812
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Or underneath.
-[Prue] No.

813
00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

814
00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the biscuit is lovely.
As it should be.

815
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah. Now these look good.

816
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The hearts are quite defined.

817
00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a bit of definition
on there from the lines.

818
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yeah.

819
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

820
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] It's got a good consistency.
-[Prue] They're very nice.

821
00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] There's a bit of definition
but there's inconsistencies.

822
00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite thick, that buttercream.

823
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the biscuit.
But it's a bit too much jam.

824
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's too sweet.

825
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, moving on,
a lot of icing sugar again.

826
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] This is very dark jam.

827
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I reckon I could paste
a poster on the wall with that.

828
00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's been over-boiled.

829
00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The jam ruins that
'cause it alters all the textures.

830
00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This has lost a lot of its shape.

831
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Those are very uneven.

832
00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've got to
cut and chill the biscuit.

833
00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's how you get the definition
and stop it from shrinking in the oven.

834
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The jam looks great,
but that buttercream, it's just…

835
00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Hardly any.
-…a thin smear. Slightly underdone.

836
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Talking of underdone.

837
00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] That's got
no stamp on it at all, has it?

838
00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is raw actually.
-Probably hasn't even hit the fridge.

839
00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hasn't hit the oven either.
At least not for long enough.

840
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] There's a bit of definition here.

841
00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're a bit thin.
-[Prue] I quite like them thin.

842
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cream's good, shape's good.

843
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think the jam flavour is good.
-[Paul] Jam's good.

844
00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-It did.

847
00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It needed longer, there's no definition.

848
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Jam ruined it, I'm afraid.

850
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

855
00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Freya, these weren't too bad.
You've lost a little bit of definition

856
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you were nearly there.
Little bit longer in the oven.

857
00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

858
00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Giuseppe, I thought

859
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a bit more filling in them.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

862
00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You did have the definition
and the biscuit tasted lovely.

863
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] It's almost unreal.

865
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's an unbelievable day
and I'm truly exhausted now.

866
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jürgen has been renamed

867
00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing stops him.

868
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He doesn't have the Austrian accent,

869
00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but he's German,
so it's close enough. [laughs]

870
00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rochica] Definitely the hardest moment
in the tent for me. I'm still optimistic.

871
00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

is a childhood toy

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

905
00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

about how they're gonna bring

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

something like a gingerbread,

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1146
00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I mean,
there's an element of movement.

1147
00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1151
00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The beach huts are a little bit messy.
But I've got the shakes.

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1163
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do they do with horses
that have broken legs?

1164
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

It's so delicate, it's so thin.

1221
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The texture's spot-on.
-[Prue] Very good.

-[Paul] Thank you, Rochica.

1223
00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Properly engineered.

1224
00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The way that the counters sit in
the little recess here. It looks amazing.

1225
00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a very classic ginger biscuit.
I quite like that.

1226
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the cardamom
and the cloves coming through.

1227
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Well done, Giuseppe.
-Thank you.

-[Paul] Oh, nearly!

1229
00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's very clever.

1230
00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Now it just has to taste wonderful
-I know.

1231
00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] And it's a little bit cakey.

1232
00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I like that, especially if it's thick,
you don't want it to be too hard.

1233
00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's perfect.

1234
00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But you're missing a row of red balls.
-[Chigs] I know.

1235
00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1236
00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
There's a show, "Paint Along with Prue."

1237
00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Getting out of jail free
by adding that palette

1238
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and saying "paint it yourself"
is interesting.

1239
00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The ginger and the chocolate together,
it is probably too strong.

1240
00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-[Prue] You know what?

1241
00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you have it with a bit of icing,
it tones it down and it's delicious.

1242
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Ta.

1243
00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Well done.

1244
00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With that painting skills, you could get
a job in our factory if this goes wrong.

1245
00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Done.

1246
00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Look at that.

1247
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue chuckles]

1248
00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've created quite a high structure,

1249
00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but having said that, it is so thin.

1250
00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Well I agree, it's <i>sehr gut.</i>

00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1252
00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks beautiful.

1254
00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not overly sweet at all.

1255
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's got
a lovely flavour in the mouth.

1256
00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Very nice.
-[Paul] You've done a great job.

1257

1259
00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God. Gonna be sick. I can't do this.

1260
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Paul would look good with them on.

[Prue] I'll taste the brush.

1264
00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely. Lemon and poppy.

1265
00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1266
00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Beautiful.
-I think the design's very clever.

1267
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I think you've got
your flavours spot on too.

1268
00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue] Well done.

1269
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that's beautiful.
And I love the painting.

1270
00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you think it could be a bit softer?

1271
00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's okay, considering
what it's doing. It's not overly hard.

1272
00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Structurally she's pretty sound as well.

1273
00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

The saddle is beautiful,
the tail, the head.

1276
01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Must have been heartbreaking

1277
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was a little bit, yeah.

1278
01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Let's see what it tastes like.

1279
01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a sugar biscuit
and that's, erm, honey buttercream.

1280
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1281
01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would never in a million years
have chosen that biscuit to build this.

1282
01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you managed to--

1284
01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've made it three times before
and it stayed up.

1285
01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Just a shame
it looks the way it does.

1286
01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It would've been right up there.

1287
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would admit that's some of the best
biscuit things that we'd have ever had.

1288
01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1289
01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll get in the TARDIS
and we'll go back in time.

1290
01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, I've flown it before.
-[mouthing]

1291
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] For me, it's a bit basic.

1292
01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think, as a decoration,
it needs to be a lot more elaborate.

1293
01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But I think we need
to taste the gingerbread.

1294
01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I would've made that a little bit
thinner to allow a nice snap.

1295
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-It's a little bit thick and heavy.

1296
01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think if you were looking
at a traditional school report,

1297
01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it'd say, "Needs to try harder."

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1299
01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks a bit rough and ready.

1300
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The rough-and-ready look
of the painting was deliberate.

1301
01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And there were two sails.

1302
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There was a tall sail at the back,
but the mast broke.

1303
01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-'Cause of the water, the waves.

1304
01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the way the cargo was loaded,
that was the problem.

1305
01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And that too, yeah.
-[Prue chuckling]

1306
01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't give me that waffle.

1307
01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a go at the biscuit.

1308
01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm, the cardamom
comes through well in that.

1309
01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a lovely blend.

1310
01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It tastes delicious,
but it's a bit rough and ready.

1311
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.

1312
01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

1313
01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I still feel in danger, because they both
said it was rough and ready, the finish.

1314
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes it was,
but it was finished nonetheless.

1315
01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Amanda] It's a mess.

1316
01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mine's the only one that's collapsed,

1317
01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I think the chances
of staying are slim.

1318
01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Maggie] I would give anything
to be here another week.

1319
01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite silly, really,

1320
01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but when I've watched people
on <i>Bake Off</i> before, crying,

1321
01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've thought, "For goodness sake.
[chuckling] You know, it's only cake."

1322
01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And suddenly it's all changed.

1323
01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckling] But everybody's
so much more skilful.

1324
01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, um, so we'll see, we'll see.

1325
01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt]<i> It's decision time</i>
<i>for Prue and Paul.</i>

1326
01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Who will be named Star Baker</i>

1327
01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and whose time in the tent</i>
<i>will come to an end?</i>

1328
01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Week two, that was a pretty high
standard of Showstopper, wasn't it?

1329
01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That was great.
-[Prue] It really was.

1330
01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I felt so sorry for Amanda.

1331
01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If that rocking horse had held together,

1332
01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it would've been right up there
because it tasted beautiful.

1333
01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was so delicate.

1334
01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The one I'm most
worried about is Jairzeno.

1335
01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were looking at that going,
"It's kind of a ship."

1336
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or a barge. He had a very leaky stern.

1337
01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All his bakes have been rough and ready.

1338
01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Jairzeno is in
a little bit of trouble, I agree.

1339
01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I would even put Maggie down there.

1340
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She struggled in the signature

1341
01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I wasn't convinced that that beach hut
was strong enough.

1342
01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think, for me,
in line for Star Baker, Jürgen.

1343
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Yes, certainly.
-[Paul] Giuseppe's up there as well.

1344
01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] What about Chigs?
-I think Chigs has to be up there

1345
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because that snooker table is fantastic.

1346
01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One of the names you didn't mention there
who did really well, I think, was George.

1347
01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] George, I think,
sort of jumped up a bit.

1348
01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I love George
because I think he has real imagination,

1349
01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and his concepts are always great.

1350
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, they're really good.
-They're just sort of…

1351
01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] He's not very neat.
-…tatty at the edges.

1352
01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just had this thought…

1353
01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, George grew up in Cyprus.
You were in Cyprus for a while.

1354
01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're probably, what, about 25 years
older than George?

1355
01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You like the ladies. Do you feel
a sort of paternal sense towards him?

1356
01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Matt, this is going nowhere.
-Yeah. It's finished, don't worry.

1357
01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, bakers, it falls to me to announce
who is the smartest cookie.

1358
01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you see what I did there?
That was really good, wasn't it?

1359
01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This week's Star Baker is…

1360
01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jürgen.

1361
01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all applauding]

1362
01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That means I've got the horrible job
of announcing who's going home.

1363
01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This only gets harder
as we get to know you all,

1364
01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the person who's leaving us
this week is…

1365
01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jairzeno.

1366
01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, bro.

1367
01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You don't deserve to go, oh, God.
-Thank you.

1368
01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Loved the idea, mate.
-Thank you.

1369
01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was half-expecting that result

1370
01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because if you look at the Showstopper,
compared to everybody else's,

1371
01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
mine was quite basic.

1372
01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, I'm so sad.
-[chuckles]

1373
01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] I'm really relieved,

1374
01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I am absolutely gutted
that Jairzeno's gone.

1375
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We sit and talk all the time.
He's so lovely. He's so laid-back.

1376
01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And his flavours are amazing.
I don't understand, well…

1377
01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Someone has to go.

1378
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maggie] Amazing, I mean…

1379
01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I think, this afternoon,

1380
01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I learned the real meaning
of the little expression,

1381
01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"The skin of your teeth."

1382
01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Well done, Giuseppe.
You really did good.

1383
01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much.

1384
01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've had a very, very good couple of days.
I'm very happy with how it went.

1385
01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jürgen deserved it entirely.
It's very stiff competition.

1386
01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rochica] I'm so proud of you.

1387

1388
01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got no plans
for stopping The Baking Terminator.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm Star Baker again.
