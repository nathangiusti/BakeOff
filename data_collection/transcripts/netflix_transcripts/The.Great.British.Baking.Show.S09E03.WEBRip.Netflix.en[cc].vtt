a lot of water in a focaccia.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

one of everything in one bite,

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then you'd have smashed it.

you end up with a dry spot,

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then you're going to have
exposed areas of dough.

405
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that'll always catch.
So what you've done is over-baked this.

406
00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The flavours are lovely. Really powerful.
-[Chigs] Yeah?

407
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Great flavours there.
-It's delicious.

408
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite an open structure,
but it needed to be much, much thicker.

409
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's beautiful, annoyingly thin.

410
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-It needed to be a little bit thicker.

411
00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that was beautiful.
Great flavour combination.

412
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it's so unusual because it's so fresh.

413
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Highly unusual, but beautiful.

414
00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-[Paul] Thank you.

415
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Thank you!

416
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It looks really nice.

417
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's got a nice top,
it's fairly equal.

418
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've filled the tin quite nicely.

419
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's lovely. Good flavour,
nice and soft, crisp on the outside.

420
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could've proved it a little bit longer
just to open it up a little bit more,

421
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you have an irregular
structure with a crispy top

422
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and a fantastic flavour and colour,
so I can't fault it that much.

423
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think it's a great focaccia.
-Ta.

424
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] It's slightly over-baked.
-Mmm-hmm.

425
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You have a big wet spot
that runs down there along the base.

426
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
More proving and less baking.

427
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite tight inside.
It needed more mixing.

428
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It does break pretty easily.
It's more cake-like than bread-like.

429
00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jürgen, I'm not absolutely mad
about the flavours.

430
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I normally love kippers.

431
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just think it could have been
a little bit better.

432
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the sort of focaccia
that I would bake,

433
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but let's have a look inside, shall we?
-Yes.

434
00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's really nice. It's soft,
and yet it's got the focaccia structure.

435
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Shows it's proved correctly.

436
00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the thing that I particularly like,
you haven't gone overboard with flavour.

437
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And made a beautifully light focaccia.

438
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you get a mouthful
of everything on every bite.

439
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's what focaccia is.
-Thank you.

440
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's beautiful. Well done.

441
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all applauding]

442
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Are you all right, Giuseppe?
[laughs]

443
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] So this is your recipe,
and you must give it to me.

444
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

445
00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[whispers] Well done! Nice!
-Wow.

446
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both exhale in relief]

447
00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe whispering indistinctly]

448
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] I got a little emotional
because I never thought I would get one.

449
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was expecting a "but" there,
so you know…

450
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"But this is wrong.
But you should have done this different."

451
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] I'm quite okay with that.
"Annoyingly thin."

452
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I don't mind being annoyingly thin.

453
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Considering I started again,
things turned out pretty well.

454
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] <i>This time,</i>

455
00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul and Prue certainly
have high standards.

456
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's not a tragedy.

458
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

460
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Welcome back, bakers.

461
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's Bread week, so obviously,
Paul's set your Technical challenge today.

462
00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, any words of advice?

463
00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a fairly complicated recipe,
but be careful how you add the filling.

464
00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As ever, this task is judged blind.

465
00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So Paul and Prue,
if you'd like to leave the tent.

466
00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bye-bye. We will miss you.

467
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For your Technical challenge,

468
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul would like you each

469
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to make a batch of 15 olive and cheese
ciabatta breadsticks.

470
00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your ciabatta breadsticks have to have
that classic ciabatta holey texture

471
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with an even distribution
of cheese and olives.

472
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They should be served
alongside a tzatziki dip.

473
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Noel, do you have anything
amusing to say about tzatziki?

474
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Funny you should ask, Matthew,

475
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I peered into
Prue's dressing room earlier,

476
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and Paul was on his knees,

477
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
rubbing tzatziki into Prue's feet
while she was asleep. [chuckles]

478
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Really?
-Yeah.

479
00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did that happen?

480
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know. How am I supposed to know
what's real life and what's a dream?

481
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, what do you think this is?
Is this real or a dream?

482
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is definitely a nightmare.

483
00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Yeah, I used to be in films.

484
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. You have two hours.

485
00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks…
-[sing-song] Get set…

486
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake!

487
00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a genuine nightmare.

488
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Never made ciabatta,
never made breadsticks.

489
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And never made ciabatta breadsticks.

490
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I can blag my way through it.

491
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think. We will see.

492
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bread knowledge bomb. [mimics explosion]

493
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

494
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] So we're looking for
a gorgeous ciabatta stick,

495
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
obviously all the same size
and the same colour.

496
00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice and brown.

497
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Too pale, they'll just flop.

498
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ciabatta. It's a very soft dough.
Quite tricky to work with.

499
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're trying to keep the air in.
-[Paul] Yeah. They gotta be careful.

500
00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[cracking]
-[Prue] Have that ciabatta rip.

501
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] If you look inside,
you see a beautiful open structure.

502
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's full of cheese. It's full of olives.
-Mmm.

503
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Heaven.

504
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now we have an Italian in the tent.

505
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He will know what ciabatta is,

506
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but is he wise enough

I've never made ciabatta bread.
So this is gonna be an interesting one.

[Maggie] "Make the dough."

510
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What could be simpler than that?

511
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Six hundred grams of water,
750 grams of flour.

512
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's 80% hydration, this dough,
so it's gonna be very wet and sticky.

513
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The mix is kind of just
letting it swill about.

514
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, golly gosh,
that cannot be good, can it?

515
00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

516
00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As we say <i>a schiaffeggiare,</i>
as we say in Italian.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So when the dough slaps
against the faces of the bowl,

518
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that's a good sign
that it's coming together.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Freya] And I thought focaccia
was a wet dough.

520
00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is just water.

521
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

manchego, onion and coriander."

-Yeah, it's a waste of time.

525
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I completely agree.

526
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This task is a waste of time!

527
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As you were. Carry on.

528
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm contemplating
whether to chop the olives

529
00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or just to leave them.

530
00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am putting my olives in whole.

531
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll go with that, otherwise the whole
olive will be as thick as the breadstick.

532
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was gonna put it on the bench,
but I feel like it's too sticky.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks like I'm dealing
with troll bogies, doesn't it?

535
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Something wrong with you then.

539
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

what a breadstick was until I was 18.

Oh, my God!

611
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stop it!
-Yeah. [laughs]

612
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Was that you? Jürgen, I didn't know
you had that in you.

613
00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] Come on. Second prove.

614
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give 'em as long to prove as possible.

615
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lizzie] How do you get 'em in these bags?

616
00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you are half an hour away
from victory, tragedy or comedy.

617
00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or maybe all three.

618
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I'm going to go
for, like, eight more minutes,

619
00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then I'm going
to stick them in the oven.

620
00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The proof is very key, but given
the time restriction on this challenge,

621
00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
erm…

622
00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll do two 30-minute proofs,
which is very, very little.

623
00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So when you're home
and you're proving stuff, what do you do?

624
00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Er, read, maybe go for a run.

625
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow. You definitely
haven't got children, have you?

626
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, hell no.
-[chuckles]

627
00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Reading. Let me think, I remember that.
Going for a run.

628
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hang on.
I'm just going back into the archives.

629
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

630
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There it is, look, one word. "Bake."

631
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, I'm just going in.

632
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] It's high temperature, 220.
I'm hoping that twenty minutes is enough.

633
00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Amanda] I'm going to go for 12,

634
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then I'll have a look halfway
and see how they are.

635
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

636
00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll keep this in for a bit longer.

637
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rochica] I haven't shaped them
all at the same time.

638
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I don't want
to put them all in at the same time.

639
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[timer beeping]
-I'm gonna do ten minutes at first

640
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then check them.

641
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It will be what it is.

642
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] Has everyone
put theirs in the oven?

643
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good. Just me.

644
00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know if I'm doing this right,
but I feel like long proof, short bake.

645
00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Freya] Don't even know
how long breadsticks usually take.

646
00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just don't want them to be raw.

647
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have 15 hours left.

648
00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Minutes.
-[in silly accent] Same difference.

649
00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe I'll just put them in.
Please be good to me, please.

650
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, that's fine.

651
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We should bake
on a "bread" setting at 220.

652
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] Oh. Turning it up a little bit.

653
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, so it says, "bread oven, 220."
So I've set my oven to 220 now.

654
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no point opening the oven door,

655
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just gonna let cold air in.
They're not cooked yet.

656
00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're not overcooked.

657
00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's turn the oven up.

658
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're looking out at me. Olive eyes.

659
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckling]

660
00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rochica] Take those ones out,
'cause there's like cheese,

661
00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't want to over-bake them.

662
00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How long have we got left?

663
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have five minutes
remaining in this task.

664
00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You will then have to end the task.

665
00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:11.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once that's happened,
then obviously the task will be over.

666
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then there'll be some judging and--

667
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You got four minutes left.
-[laughs]

668
00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Should I take them out?

669
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're still a bit blonde.

670
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perhaps I should put the grill on.

671
00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They take surprisingly long.

672
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I think it's good I went in when I did.

673
00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on.

674
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to get a wriggle on.

675
00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So over Bread Week.

676
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Giuseppe, yours are browning nicely.

677
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that the top tray is done.

678
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm taking this out.

679
00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, they look baked. God knows.

680
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was just so confident
they would bake in 15 minutes.

681
00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Too late.
-Bakers, you have one minute left.

682
00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Freya] "One minute"?
This is just rather wild.

683
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rochica] Oh, mine are terrible.

684
00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Breadstick Jenga.

685
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's what everyone
wants to be playing right now.

686
00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just now or never, really.

687
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Giuseppe sighs]
-Where's my scissors?

688
00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Crystelle] Just tell me I can do it.
-[Lizzie] You have got this right now.

689
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe] Come on, come on, come on.

690
00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[sighs]
-[Crystelle] Come on, come on, come on.

691
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up.

692
00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh God, what a nightmare.

693
00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:30.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please bring your bakes to the front
and place them behind your photograph.

694
00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mine are going to be raw. Oh, God.

695
00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is a lot of carbs.

696
00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, all right. Paul hates raw things.

697
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh God! Nightmare.

698
00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>Paul and Prue are looking</i>

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Hmm.

703
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Now these…

704
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're like snakes.
-They're a little bit sad.

705
00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not long enough in the oven.

706
00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:14.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want them to be open-structured
and crispy on the outside,

707
00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it's a bit bready, but it tastes good.

708
00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're slightly up and down in shape.

709
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, they are. Bit irregular.

710
00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue] That's good stuff.

711
00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm. It is. These are better.
The bread's good. It's crispy.

712
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nice to see the olives whole as well.
They got a bit of a stronger bake.

713
00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They need a little bit longer,
but there's a couple good ones.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've lost a lot of the air
when it's been cut.

715
00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very odd shape too.
-[Paul] Longer in the oven.

716
00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] The bread flavour's good.
-And more careful with the stretching.

717
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now these are too small, and then you get
that rigidity in there as well.

718
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it needed to be longer.
We're testing for their bread skills.

719
00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This almost looks like it's been rolled.

720
00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite tight inside,
it's not really open at all.

721
00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Slightly more colour
and crispness on it.

722
00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Got no onions in it.

723
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It misses it actually. It needs it.
-Mmm. Move on to the next one.

724
00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shape-wise, they're good.
It's just the colour. They needed longer.

725
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does taste good.

726
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue] Mmm.

727
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Moving on, these are all
very pale, and flat.

728
00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] And raw.
-[Paul] And raw.

729
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue chuckles]

730
00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All the cheese has come out here.

731
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

732
00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a blind panic in this.
They haven't been in the oven long enough.

733
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Either that or the oven wasn't hot--
-Or it wasn't on.

734
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

735
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This one also looks a bit underdone.

736
00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know that it's a rustic dish,

737
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I'd feel cheated
if I got this one and you got this one.

738
00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The flavour's nice though.

739
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They need to be a bit more
uniform than that.

740
00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Now these don't look too bad.

741
00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] The colour's better.
-That's pretty good.

742
00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It's holding its shape.
-You see whole olives all the way through.

743
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Structure's better.

744
00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's nice though.
-Yeah, they're quite strong.

745
00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like that one.

746
00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Same issue again?
-Underdone.

747
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Run out of time.

748

[chuckling] That smell is so lovely.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] You got a bit of, er…
-[Prue] Flour all over me.

750
00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

751
00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I was kissing it.
-Oh, right.

752
00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kissing it better.

753
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Massively under-baked.
-[Prue] Yeah.

754
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a shame. Flavour's all right, though.

755
00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, these… Looks like it's been twisted.

756
00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's been twisted a bit, hasn't it?
But that looks quite nice.

757
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's quite effective.
It's got a nice colour.

758

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Delicious. You can taste the crust,

760
00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

which is key.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

779
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Your milk bread displays

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Milk bread just means that you replace
the water content in the dough with milk.

that they use for party food.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

for being a little bit smooth,

840
00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Noel] These are amazing.

1122
00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hello, Neil.
-Neil or Noel?

1123
00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Noel.

1124
00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought we were close. I'm heartbroken.

1125
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Is it?

1127
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exclaims] Golly gosh.

1128
00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're not as shell-like
as I'd like them to be

1129
00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but they're okay.

1130
00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know
if they're baked in the middle.

1131
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got lime curd in here

1132
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I'm just using it
to pipe my roast potatoes.

1133
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm brushing the top of my crab
with agave nectar,

1134
00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is basically
a vegan version of honey.

1135
00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I've got the handle
for the basket left in the oven.

1136
00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh, that's going to come out
in a couple of minutes.

1137
00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Time check, somebody, please.

1138
00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

1140
00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, it's all a bit
of a shambles, isn't it, really?

1141
00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That last hour just goes.

1142
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just adding a bit of isomalt
just to secure it a bit more.

1143
00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[George] Oh, used the wrong arm.
Doesn't matter.

1144
00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lizzie] My pumpkins are a bit burnt,
but better burnt than underdone.

1145
00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wonder if the eyes are higher up.
What does a crab even look like?

1146
00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are looking okay,
unless they collapse.

1147
00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hopefully they… They hold up.

1148
00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The only thing holding
this koala together is my hands.

1149
00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looked fine a second ago.

1150
00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Freya] Stupid bread.

1151
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just giving the kid a dummy.
Maybe it's making too much noise.

1152
00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's just lost his head. [chuckles]

1153
00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very delicate,
but it's staying up on its own now.

1154
00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do a milk display,
why'd you have to stack it?

1155
00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's falling.

1156
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Still looking like a chicken,
which is good.

1157
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Freya] I feel like Paul's gonna go,
"That's not attached."

1158
00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul can like what he wants,
but he's getting what he's given.

1159
00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rochica] Spent so long trying to fix this
that I left them in the oven too long.

1160
00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have one minute left.

1161
00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] Oh, God.

1162
00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maggie] I'm really on it now.

1163
00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a particular breed of mushroom,
this one,

1164
00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that you can only find
in the <i>Bake Off</i> tent.

1165
00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know whether there's
any sweetcorn in Tudor banquets

1166
00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but there is in mine.

1167
00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. I thought I'd lost an arm.

1168
00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would never plate a roast dinner
up like this at home.

1169
00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, right,
I need to put them on the board.

1170
00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] Some finishing touches.

1171
00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lizzie] Don't like the way
he's gone all crinkly.

1172
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe] Doesn't want to fit anywhere.

1173
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that's hilarious. [laughs]

1174
00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God! Just stay.

1175
00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up.

1176
00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-All right.
-Please step away from your bakes.

1177
00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[sighs heavily]
-[Chigs] Sick, happy, done.

1178
00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can I eat this?

1179
00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Comfort eating. [laughing]

1180
00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] We are a good bunch, aren't we?
Look at that octopus.

1181
00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything is so stunning.

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>It's judgment time</i>
<i>for the baker's Showstoppers.</i>

1183
00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[in Australian accent] Mate,
would you like to bring your koala up?

1184
00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1185
00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think he's adorable.
-[Paul] It's simple, but it works.

1186
00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Lovely.

1187
00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bread's a bit heavy.

1188
00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The thing is, when you do
stand-up milk bread sculptures,

1189
00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the dough is so soft, it will collapse.

1190
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Paul] It works on a koala.

1191
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'Cause it's quite charming.

1192
00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's concertinaed up
because it can't carry the weight.

1193
00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think the design is clever enough,
and your base one…

1194
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is nice. It's just sweet enough.

1195
00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Well done, George.
-Thank you very much.

1196
00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've caught a few of them in the oven.

1197
00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-But I quite like that.

1198
00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Looks like it's been on a barbecue.
-[both laughing]

1199
00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the overall design
I think is very clever.

1200
00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pig was probably up here,
and it's dropped a bit.

1201
00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So basically you've got mango tea.

1202
00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. I did have a pet pig,
so, it's called, er, Susie.

1203
00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened to Susie?

1204
00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She slipped on ice,
we had to get her put down.

1205
00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all chuckling]

1206
00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Slipped on ice?

1207
00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Don't take pigs ice-skating.

1208
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She was living in the garden,
the ground got icy.

1209
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the texture. And it is light.

1210
00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can get that tea, can't you?

1211
00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not sure whether I like it, but, erm…
-Quite perfumed.

1212
00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I can identify it,
that's the key thing.

1213
00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Lizzie.
-Ta.

1214
00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's beautifully done.

1215
00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's not bad.
It looks quite well-proved.

1216
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can see how round it is.

1217
00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I think that's really well made.

1218
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I don't get
a lot of orange blossom flavour.

1219
00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You get a hint of something
slightly aromatic at the back.

1220
00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's light, it's fluffy.

1221
00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The textures and colours
are pretty consistent.

1222
00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a nice bread, that.
-[Prue] Very nice.

1223
00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Good design.
Simple but highly effective as well.

1224
00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done, Chigs.

1225
00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite abstract. Looks quite rustic,
and then this looks quite neat.

1226
00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

1227
00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is that four and a half hours'
worth of work?

1228
00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it was for me.

1229
00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1230
00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good answer.

1231
00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[continues laughing]

1232
00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's under-proved and it's got no flavour.

1233
00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm hard-pushed
to find the seaweed in that.

1234
00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See, there's simply not enough in it.

1235
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sweetness is there,
but it's very cake-like.

1236
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could be a bit lighter.

1237
00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I honestly think
if you put a bit of salt in it,

1238
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you'd have the flavour,
because I can get the seaweed.

1239
00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But there's no doubt
that salt would enhance it.

1240
00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Maggie]
Well, that's rather disappointing.

1241
00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But never mind.
-[Paul] Yeah, it is.

1242
00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Maggie.
-Thank you.

1243
00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Well done.

1244
00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The way you've incorporated
different flavours

1245
00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in different breads is very clever.

1246
00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The baby…

1247
00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul and Prue chuckle]

1248
00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
…is very basic,
but it does work, it's effective.

1249
00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Colour looks great on the bread as well.
You glazed this?

1250
00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I glazed it with egg wash. Egg wash.

1251
00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely flavour.

1252
00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Very good flavour.
-The sweetness level's just right.

1253
00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But for me, it is slightly under-proved,

1254
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and therefore
you haven't got that structure.

1255
00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, nearly there.

1256
00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-[Paul] Thank you, Jürgen.
-Thank you.

1257
00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very clever.
And you've created a theme.

1258
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The chicken could have been a bit higher.

1259
00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Spatchcock.
-Uh, yeah.

1260
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's definitely
a spatchcock or a turtle.

1261
00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think your craqueline
could've been a bit darker.

1262
00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Crystelle] Okay.
-[Paul] A bit longer in the oven

1263
00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
would've created more of a darkness to it.

1264
00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:28.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavours are great, though.
The citrus kick is fantastic.

1265
00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:32.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The top is beautiful.
The texture is lovely. It's light.

1266
00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got a nice sweetness to it,
which is just right.

1267
00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's really a nice slice of bread.
-Thank you very much.

1268
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the design is incredible.
You've done an amazing job.

1269
00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's actually quite simple,
but you've executed it beautifully.

1270
00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul's never had fruit or veg before.

1271
00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He only eats bread.
So can you tell us what each one is?

1272
00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you've got a courgette--

1273
00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He is as well.
-[all laughing]

1274
01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Apples and mushrooms, yeah.

1275
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The texture in there,
it's light, it bounces back.

1276
01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the flavour's in there as well.

1277
01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's difficult to get orange
to come through in bread,

1278
01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you get the zest,
which is a much purer form of orange.

1279
01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've done
something that's, erm, very clever.

1280
01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's absolutely delicious.
And I think the texture's lovely.

1281
01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done, Giuseppe.
-Thank you.

1282
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you've done a really good job.

1283
01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've lost a lot of definition,
but you've utilized that to your strengths

1284
01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to make the octopus the way it does.

1285
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very clever and effective.

1286
01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's delightful.

1287
01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can see how tender the loaf is.

1288
01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love that. I love the flavour.

1289
01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sweetness is just the right side
of sweetness, and the texture is spot-on.

1290
01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's not bouncy.

1291
01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've ended up
with a massive air pocket in there.

1292
01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think it's very good,
very brioche-like.

1293
01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's light, it's well-baked.
-I think you've done a terrific job.

1294
01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Thank you so much.

1295
01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's something wrong
with the proportions.

1296
01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That little bird, even if it was upright,

1297
01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
couldn't have laid those eggs
in a million years.

1298
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's over-proved.
You've lost it 'cause it's going flat.

1299
01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit tight.
It's under-proved as well.

1300
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is going to prove
at a slightly different level to this.

1301
01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Rochica] Oh, okay.
-[Paul] Because it's smaller pieces.

1302
01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cinnamon level's right.
Sweetness level's right as well.

1303
01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just that the dough's too dense.

1304
01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And when you say
that's four and a half hours' work,

1305
01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wouldn't believe you.

1306
01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, that does taste absolutely delicious.
But the texture's not right.

1307
01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you, Rochica.
-Thank you.

1308
01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I think it's really very amusing.

1309
01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I must say that the crab shell
is so realistic.

1310
01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's beautifully done.
-I like it, it's very neat.

1311
01:01:58.560 --> 01:01:59.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look.

1312
01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is the beach demerara sugar
or soft brown sugar?

1313
01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it's soft brown sugar.

1314
01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nice milk bread.
The structure's light, holds its shape.

1315
01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the sweetness levels
are just right as well.

1316
01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's not overly sweet.
-It's nicely baked.

1317
01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tastes good, and I love the look of it.
I think it's just hilarious.

1318
01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Aw, thank you so much. [chuckles]

1322
01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm really thrilled about it. Yeah.

1325
01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And this is maybe
the last time you see me.

1326
01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rochica] <i>It's definitely been</i>
<i>my worst week.</i>

1327
01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would like another chance,
but I don't know if I'm going to get one.

1328
01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

1329
01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] So where are we at?

1330
01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Milk bread's quite difficult
to do properly.

1331
01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think most of them
did a pretty good job.

1332
01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Simplicity was the way forward.
And I think Giuseppe got that.

1333
01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What Giuseppe has done is clever.

1334
01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] What about Freya?
-[Paul] I would say Freya was up there.

1335
01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She has done well.

1336
01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a few people
who are sort of middle ground,

1337
01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I thought Jürgen saved himself.

1338
01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-George is--
-Lizzie is doing well.

1339
01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lizzie really excelled, I think.

1340
01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about Maggie?

1341
01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Maggie struggled.
-[Prue] I think she's in trouble.

1342
01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't get the flavours in that.

1343
01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought the structure
wasn't particularly good.

1344
01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it was a little bit too simple.

1345
01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the two people,
I think Maggie and I also think Rochica.

1346
01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The trouble with Rochica's
is that the whole thing didn't work

1347
01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because there wasn't
a loaf of bread there,

1348
01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and we're trying to judge bread.

1349
01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I really like them all now.
I don't want anybody to go home.

1350
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is quite a hard point to leave,

1351
01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because they're just
getting to know each other now…

1352
01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Settled--
-Settling into the life

1353
01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of the prison camp where we film.

1354
01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all chuckling]

1355
01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To be fair, a lot of them
have tried to escape already.

1356
01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, bakers. Big week, bread week.

1357
01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Especially in front
of the breadfather, Paul.

1358
01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a tough one,
but you all did really well.

1359
01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got the great job this week
of announcing who is Star Baker.

1360
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The person who's Star Baker this week is…

1361
01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Giuseppe.
-[all applauding]

1362
01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah! <i>Bravo!</i>

1363
01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now I have the less fun job of telling you
who's going to be going home,

1364
01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it gets harder and harder each week

1365
01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because we're becoming friends
and we're bonding.

1366
01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we don't want to lose anyone.

1367
01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm afraid
we are going to be losing somebody,

1368
01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that person is…

1369
01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rochica.

1370
01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Freya] It's okay.

1371
01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rochica] <i>It's come to end,</i>
<i>but I have really, really enjoyed it.</i>

1372
01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And not everybody gets to bake
in the <i>Bake Off</i> tent.

1373
01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm proud of where I've got to.

1374
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1375
01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just don't do anything to,
like, time. [laughs]

1376
01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We're gonna miss you.
-I'll miss you too.

1377
01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just getting to know you.
-I know, right?

1378
01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Maggie] Your family
will be so happy to see you.

1379
01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughing] I think
I was very close to the edge.

1380
01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cliff was crumbling rather badly,
but I seem to have scraped through again.

1381
01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done, Maggie.
-I don't know how I keep doing it.

1382
01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Squeak through.
-Squeak through.

1383
01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Next week,
I've got to be spectacular. [snorts]

1384
01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] <i>Can't win them all.</i>

1385
01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It feels very good to be
at the end of Bread Week and still in.

1386
01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] So deserved, really.
-Thank you.

1387
01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Star Baker, can you believe that?

1388

I better savour it 'cause
it ain't gonna happen again. [laughs]
