Still quite shaky, to be honest.

130
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

131
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The perfect Swiss roll
is very hard to achieve.

132
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It should be round, not oval.

133
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then, of course,
we want the perfect swirl.

134
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Iain] Whoo.

135
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A Swiss roll sponge
is quite malleable actually.

136
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Beautifully soft.
You don't want it to crack,

137
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
and what we're asking for
is an inlay into that sponge.

138
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
This is the decorative batter.

139
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
So it's just equal parts icing sugar,
flour, butter, egg white.

140
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Basically, you draw all over
a piece of paper,

141
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and on top of that, the sponge goes,

142
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so when it bakes,
the inlay remains in the sponge.

143
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's important
that the colour's vibrant

144
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because we must be able to see it.

145
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We want something bold,
full of colour and full of flavour.

146
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Of course I want it to taste
absolutely delicious,

147
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I want it to be surprising too.

I think that's because
my cold butter this morning.

618
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It is the butter.
It's almost created a skin.

619
00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sponge itself,
I find a little bit claggy.

620
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it could come down
to your folding.

621
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Folding the flour in.

622
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. The flavours, though, are very good.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] So, Hassan, not your best morning.

625
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] No.
-[Hassan] Quite disappointed myself.

626
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It looks like a roulade
rather than a Swiss roll.

627
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Wow.

628
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I had a ball of ice cream
next to this in a bowl,

629
00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I would be totally happy.
-[Paul] Yeah, absolutely.

630
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flavour-wise, stunning,
absolutely delicious,

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it's been dropped out of a tree.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Hassan] Okay, cheers.

634
00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They did say "stunning and delicious".

635
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, but "looked like
it fell out of a tree".

638
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
That is one
mighty impressive-looking Swiss roll.

639
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

640
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a shame it sat down on itself.

641
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a wee bit of an oval, yeah.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue] Extremely impressive.

643
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] It's amazing.

644
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mm. The flavours are stunning.
-Thank you.

645
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I was nervous that the marshmallow
and the jam would make it all too sweet,

646
00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it's delicious.

647
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You left the condensed milk out.
-[Iain] I did.

648
00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's such a student thing.

649
00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm 29. I'm not a student any more.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

652
00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

654
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Iain] I thought
I was taking a bit of a risk.

655
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I couldn't have possibly imagined
that it would turn out as good as it did.

656
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
First one in the bag, no major mess-ups,
but definitely not getting ahead of myself

657
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and thinking, "Oh, it went great",
'cause I practised that one a lot.

658
00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They all… loved the… design and flavours.

659
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so happy.

660
00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was a little bit firm.

661
00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the first time that's happened.
It's the curse of the tent.

662
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like Prue said, I think, not my best day.

663
00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Toby] I'm lagging behind,

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so praying that the Technical
is something that I have made before.

665
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just get on with it.
That's what my husband said.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your Technical challenge

673
00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
First of all, don't panic.

674
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

well-set jam, smooth buttercream,

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

689
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have two hours and 15 minutes.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll need to figure out the flavours
and the recipe all by yourselves,

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

700
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never made one of these before.
First time for everything.

701
00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jasmine did say,
literally as we went to the loo earlier…

702
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"There's one thing that I really, really
hope it's not: a fondant fancy." [gasps]

703
00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just trying to work out the flavours.

704
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's cherry.

705
00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want to go for cherry,
but it really tastes like raspberry.

706
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's definitely almond notes to it.

707
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not sure. [laughs]
I'm just gonna eat the whole thing

708
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and hope for the best.

709
00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] So, Paul, fondant fancies.

710
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This'll be challenging for our bakers.

711
00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've obviously taken the recipe away,

712
00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but left them with all the ingredients
and a few more on top of that.

713
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But essentially, what is in this
is raspberry and almond.

714
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By "almond", I don't mean ground almonds.

715
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean almond extract,
which is where the flavour will come from.

716
00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we've given them
ground almonds as well.

717
00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've given them everything.
We've given them a perfect example.

718
00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So they should understand
what type of sponge it is.

719
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once they have the sponge ready,
they've got to prepare the buttercream.

720
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Again, has almond extract in there.

You know what?
I'm gonna add a little bit of cherry.

825
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's rose water.

826
00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:14.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was a lot of cherry.

[Hassan] I've added too much water.
It's like a pastelly pink.

830
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Almost. Look, my hands are clean.

833
00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tom] It almost looks like a flapjack.

834
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Trim the edges, then measure it,
and then nine equal bits.

835
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

836
00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

838
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't serve it. This is raw.
So no one's getting that one.

845
00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're doing eight fondant fancies.
Now we'll fill these all with jam.

846
00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

847
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm Franken-caking them
to make them roughly about the same height

848
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

849
00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am gonna put the lids back on.

850
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've rather overfilled that one.
We'll hide that in the middle.

851
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-Nine little blobs.

853
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Hassan] My buttercream
is slightly too soft.

854
00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Aaron] I'm hoping
the icing covers a multitude of sins.

855
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe it will, maybe it won't.

856
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Tom] Oh, they're really taking
a lot of icing.

859
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Should have crumb-coated with buttercream.
Didn't think.

860
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're like little fairy cakes,
aren't they?

861
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

862
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tom] Bit messy.

863
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] I'm so sorry.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jasmine] This is a hot pink mess.

865
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

866
00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Toby] I really love taking it
right to the wire.

867
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tom] Oh, my God. These are hideous.

868
00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Hassan] They've kind of blended together.

869
00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think they look that bad. [laughs]

870
00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Toby] The final fancy.

Do not drop them.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh! What shall I do?

873
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna put the worst one at the back.

874
00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In fact,
I might bake another nine tonight.

Mine is stuck with icing to the table.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tom] Wow. What a fancy table.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, so what we're looking for

885
00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
are nine beautifully formed
fondant fancies.

886
00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Almond buttercream with an almond sponge

887
00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with a raspberry fondant on the outside.

888
00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Raspberry jam in the middle as well.

889
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You had a lot of red herrings.

890
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ground almonds definitely not inside
because you'll not get the height,

891
00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but we'll test them
and see what they're gonna taste like.

892
00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

893
00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue] Yes.

894
00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Be interesting

895
00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They've managed to get some jam in there.

896
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] I don't think that's bad.

897
00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Beautifully high.
-[Paul] The height on these are good.

898
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can't believe
we're gonna have 12 of these.

899
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do think there's ground almonds in there
but the colour's not bad.

901
00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

902
00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] But they're all messy,
so there is consistency.

903
00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughter]
-[Paul] But the colour's the right tone.

904
00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is quite dense sponge.

905
00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Moving on to our pink fancies.
It's not the colour we wanted.

906
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] They're quite neat.

907
00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a very strange flavour in there.
Is it rose?

908
00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

909
00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's way off base.

910
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I like the colour of these.
-[Prue] The height is very good.

911
00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The decoration is neat.
They're all the same.

912
00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-There's ground almonds in there.
-[Prue] It's quite nice cake.

913
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Moving on.
-[Prue] This is abstract decoration.

914
00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The colour's good.

915
00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Ground almonds again.
-[Prue] It's raspberry jam.

916
00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Has someone cut their finger?
I mean, that is way, way too dark.

917
00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Yeah.
-[Paul] Wow, that's tough.

918
00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It is very overbaked.

919
00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely solid. It's like cardboard.

920
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's got ground almonds--
-[Prue] It's got too much icing.

921
00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Right.
-[Paul] Colour looks nice.

922
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's very shallow,
and they should have risen more than that.

923
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I imagine that's because
there are ground almonds in there.

924
00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a nice almond flavour.
-There is a tartness from the jam.

925
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
