00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yup.

308
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just need another couple of minutes.

they can slightly over bake.

312
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The reason why I am rotating them is
so that they can get, like, an even bake.

30 minutes left, 30 minutes.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wanted them to be a bit more golden.

320
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Really quick.

321
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything is so soft that any
sort of heat on it will melt it

322
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the sandwich will just fall apart.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Tom] Ah. They are a bit dark.

325
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

335
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The last ten minutes, you can feel

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not quite even.
But I think that's quite a nice amount.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Yan] I'm filling them

341
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tom] I just thought
I was gonna have more time than this.

342
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Flo] Should have put more gin in.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are always licking my chocolate.

348
00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wasn't getting sex,
but I was looking at you, Chris,

349
00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
erm, maybe for that filling
I would be on the turn for you.

350
00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

used all the time up.

353
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The problem with having a bit of time
to spare, you probably feel a bit nervous.

gone over them a bit more.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you should try and embrace it.
Do you know what I mean?

359
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

367
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I'm not gonna have time to ice them all.

it's coming through at the end.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got the concentration
of a chocolate truffle.

absolutely perfectly even.

416
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, sorry about that. A bit oozy.

If the cream filling would have set,
it would have been a fantastic biscuit.

419
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It does look very intriguing.

420
00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Filling looks a little squashy.

[Paul] Your biscuit is quite hard.

422
00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you have worked that too much.

423
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

424
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is no gin flavour.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think the flavour is wonderful
especially the raspberry jam.

426
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love that chewy middle,
and it is still quite crisp outside.

427
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The only issue is the slight
irregular sizes,

428
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the flavours and the texture
of the almond and the coffee together,

429
00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the slight chewiness
in the bite, perfect.

430
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] The icing
is a little bit dodgy, isn't it?

432
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very dodgy.

433
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's so tough,
it's offering me out for a fight.

434
00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It is too tough.
A story of two halves.

435
00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pineapple's there,
delicious flavour, yum.

436
00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

437
00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have got consistency,
I think they look very neatly filled.

438
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, a little bit concerned
about that amount of glitter.

439
00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

440
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Crispy on the outside,
soft and cookie-like on the inside,

441
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the marshmallow has set beautifully
so when you bite in, it doesn't pour out.

442
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And in fact, with fluff like that
which is pure sugar,

443
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's clever not to have
the biscuit too sweet.

444
00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As a sandwich biscuit,
you have ticked all the boxes. Well done.

445
00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

446
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
They are dancing biscuits.

447
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Aren't they? Look at them.

448
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Boi-ing, boi-ing.

449
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's great that.

450
00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are a little bit scruffy.

451
00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very different, but because
everything's a bit strong, it's too much.

452
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You have this mix
of rosewater and cardamom,

453
00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which isn't particularly pleasant.

454
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But very daring of you to do it, though.

455
00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] And the most fun
we have had so far.

456
00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I'm just gonna do
that one more time. Yeah.

457
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Paul] That's quite incredible.

458
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were asked for 24
absolutely identical biscuits

459
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I think you might have hit it.

460
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look incredible.

461
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sharp, nice clean lines,
distinction between the two sides.

462
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A bit of drippage.

463
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's delicious.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

466
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you just get a beautiful citrus flavour.

I like the look of them. I think
the bake's good, I think the size is good.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chocolate one is just
a chocolate ganache,

473
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the central one is coffee and amaretto.

474
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have seen them on TV
and stuff and films and that.

515
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Funnily enough, I nearly made
fortune cookies a while back

516
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I thought, nah, it's too much
of a faff and I didn't do it.

517
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Argh.

518
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, fortune cookies.

519
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] On paper,
you think that's very easy,

520
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but actually this is a very
difficult technical challenge.

521
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have an almond flavour
and you have an orange flavour.

522
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They have a little pattern.

523
00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now this is all about timing.

524
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can't put all of them
into the oven at the same time.

525
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Two or three at a time
and possibly no more than that

526
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it must just brown on the outside
and when they come out,

527
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you only have a very short period of time

528
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>to create that fortune cookie shape</i>
<i>before they set.</i>

529
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, it's all speed and dexterity?

530
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the killer thing is snap.

531
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yeah, it breaks.

532
00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It says, "You will be working
with a man with blue eyes."

533
00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There you go, you see.

534
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or that means I keep
my job till tomorrow, at least.

535
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good.

536
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The first instruction
is to write 12 fortunes.

537
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you supposed to write?

538
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Look after your feet
and the rest will follow."

539
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I like that.

540
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Speak your mind for it is..."

541
00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Stupid."

542
00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do them as I go along,
cos I think of a funny one.

543
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can I read one?
-In the beginning-- of course.

544
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are all pretty much the same.

545
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] "Make it count."

546
00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-"Keep on smiling."
-Yes.

547
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] I like these,
they are quite punchy.

548
00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Make it count,
you have gone for make it count again.

549
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because you should really make it count.

550
00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should really make it count...

551
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It says mix the egg whites, oil and water.

552
00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Argh.

553
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I shouldn't look at other people.
Just do what I am doing.

554
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Julia] They need to be light,
but they don't need much air.

555
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
People are using mixers.

556
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am guessing this will be
like a twill-like consistency.

557
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So spreadable, but not too runny.

558
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chris] Looks a little lack lustre.

559
00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then divide the batter into two.

560
00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Form two circles of almond batter."

561
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How big is a fortune cookie, though?

562
00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No idea.

563
00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Probably a teaspoon of mixture
and just smooth it around? But...

564
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Yan] Just try it with one.
I know they are supposed to be thin.

565
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Absolutely no idea
how long to put these in for.

566
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am very nervous at the moment.

567
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Flo] They are going in.

568
00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[James] I am gonna start
with three minutes.

569
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That seems a lucky
Chinese number, I guess.

570
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Yan] I am gonna
go for lucky five minutes.

571
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna sit here and monitor this.

572
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is lightly golden. Okay.

573
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought they would be done like that,

574
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but actually they are quite slow to cook.

575
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite a low oven temperature.

576
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[James] Take the first one out.

577
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Flo] Going in.
I think they are too thick.

578
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once baked, place a fortune
in the centre and seal.

579
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[James] Er, I wish I had asbestos fingers.

580
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Whoo.
-Super hard.

581
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I have to work quite quick.

582
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Liam] I don't know
what they are meant to look like.

583
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stacey] That folds like that.

584
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"And seal using the rim of a glass."

585
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tom] Put it over a glass and shape?

586
00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

587
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel laughs]

588
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Anyway...
-It's as simple as that.

589
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's it, yeah.

590
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Flo sighs]

591
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Flo] There's your glass.

592
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I'm gonna put a fortune in,
fold them in half

593
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then I'm just squidging it at the edge
to give it that line underneath.

594
00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And they are not sticking.

595
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is that for?

596
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[James] Cos they will set up quite hard

597
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and put it in there,
so they don't fold out too much.

598
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] It's like origami, isn't it?
[Sophie] Yeah.

599
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I love how you don't panic.
-Is everyone else panicking?

600
00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can you not feel it?
-No, not really.

601
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's why I like being at the back.

602
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, that's panic happening.
-Okay.

603
00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Julie] I didn't expect them
to get hard as fast as they do.

604
00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] You have got to be
really, really quick.

605
00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They just crack as you've just seen.

606
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhaling]

607
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Yan] They look like
real cookies and everything.

608
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stacey] This is not right.

609
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm trying to create a shape
and I just can't get a shape.

610
00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you're cracking on me.

611
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the hell is this?

612
00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales heavily]

613
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chris] That looks more
like a Cornish pasty.

614
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's not a fortune cookie
shape in the slightest.

615
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is my two. I just can't do them.

616
00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Yan] I have only made two.

617
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Got ten to go?
-I can't give up now.

618
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Put some more in.

619

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, it says press to seal,
but then it says use the rim of a glass?

635
00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What if it goes like that then like that?

636
00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

from your own advice?

644
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Bakers, you have one hour left.

647
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna flavour the orange one now.

648
00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, it's got orange essence
and orange colouring in as well.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it tastes all synthetic and horrible.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chris] It looks more like a fried egg
and the yolks split.

653
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The idea is to make it look like segments.

658
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

666
00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Doing that. These aren't
quite cooked these ones.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:38.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is a bit of a gap, I can fix it.
Maybe I just leave it rustic.

1033
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How does a Union Jack work?
Right. White, white, white.

1034
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tom] So, I'm just setting up
these guides so when I spray my roof,

1035
00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the red doesn't bleed
all over the rest of the board.

1036
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] This is gonna be the main part
of my board,

1037
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
just trying to get a variation in colour.

1038
00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[James] This just takes time,
though, it takes a lot of filling in.

1039
00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales heavily]

1040
00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tom] I feel really nervous about this.

1041
00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales heavily]

1042
00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] Shaking so much.

1043
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chris] Just royal icing
the black sections.

1044
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] This is hot granulated sugar,
so it just holds them in place.

1045
00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Argh.

1046
00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know my own strength sometimes.

1047
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's see if they come out.

1048
00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As long as you play it just there,
we are good.

1049
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's it, can't move it
around the board at all.

1050
00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can't move it, yeah.

1051
00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

1052
00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know it doesn't look very much,
they are gonna get spray gunned.

1053
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Doing the monkeys.

1054
00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs to be really precise.
But I haven't got time.

1055
00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Liam] Just something innocent
about them not being decorated.

1056
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Argh. I just literally sprayed
that all over the place.

1057
00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tom groaning]

1058
00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need to be so much
further ahead than this.

1059
00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am quite far behind.

1060
00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I need to glue them together
and then start piping.

1061
00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tom] My game is supposed
to be a little bit playful,

1062
00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so if it's not really neat
then it's okay.

1063
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's my story anyway
and I'm sticking to it.

1064
00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you only have five minutes left.

1065
00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is me stressed.

1066
00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tom] Argh. I've got so much to do.

1067
00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have still got to do
my drainpipes and everything.

1068
00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like a duck, graceful, underneath...

1069
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Liam] This is probably the hardest thing
I have ever done in my life,

1070
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
this challenge.

1071
00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know if I will finish on time.

1072
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Flo] Oh, my God, this is terrible.

1073
00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Yan] It is not the showstopper.

1074
00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am running out of time.

1075
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anything I can help with?

1076
00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It depends, I don't know.
What are your piping skills like?

1077
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't know.
-They are powerful.

1078
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-I am known as the powerful piper.

1079
00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chris] I had to rush
to get it done in time.

1080
00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One minute.

1081
00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] Six, one, two, five...

1082
00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, bakers, your time is up.

1083
00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[groans]

1084
00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
God. I am so unhappy with that,
but whatever. [gasps] Oh!

1085
00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks like a bomb's just hit it.

1086
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>It's judgment time</i>
<i>for the bakers' showstoppers.</i>

1087
00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sophie, please bring up
your biscuit board game.

1088
00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I must say
it's very beautifully neat.

1089
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You haven't had to ice the whole thing.

1090
00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The blocks all look equal.
That is very good.

1091
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Beautiful dice.

1092
00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think we need to try
some of this.

1093
00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the lemon flavour, bergamot.

1094
00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Afterwards you get it.
-There is a little bit right at the end.

1095
00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sophie] Okay. Yeah.
-But it works.

1096
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's beautiful, crispy snap.
<i>Snakes and Ladders </i>is a classic game

1097
00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I think you have done
a very, very good job.

1098
00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was a lot better than I expected.

1099
00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

1100
00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the colours, bright as anything.

1101
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Edges are terrific. It's very neat.

1102
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The board is a mixed spice.

1103
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. Very spicy and Christmassy.

1104
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] And soft. As a biscuit,
that is too soft for me.

1105
00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the overall design is fantastic,
very much an architect's piece of work.

1106
00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The overall game
is a little disappointing.

1107
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1108
00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The biscuits are delicious.
[Prue] Aren't they?

1109
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is not much ginger coming through,
but there is lots of lime.

1110
00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Texture, it's very, very good as well.

1111
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
You make your way around
the board towards Noel and Sandi.

1112
00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughter]

1113
00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's a shame
all this has broken off

1114
00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
cos what you have essentially done
is made a lot of different biscuits

1115
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and piped different numbers on them.

1116
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The lemony one is lovely.

1117
00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The biscuit's been overworked slightly.

1118
00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's quite rubbery. The matcha
comes through, that's pretty much it.

1119
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
James, I love the colours
I mean they are my kind of colours,

1120
00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-they are bang in your face.
-Exactly.

1121
00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I really love that.

1122
00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cones have sort of worked.

1123
00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Every time I move it,
a little bit more falls off.

1124
00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that part of the game?
-It has to be a quick game.

1125
00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I must say
the texture is nice to eat.

1126
00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] That chocolate is delicious,
melts in the mouth,

1127
00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the flavour's very good.

1128
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The actual board game, the way
you have set it up, is a nice idea.

1129
00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1130
00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flo, please bring up
your biscuit board game.

1131
00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do I have to?
-Yes.

1132
00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's Mr. Neverwell.

1133
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not surprised.

1134
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, you picked these up and you try
and pick up one of these things here?

1136
00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very good.

1137
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It certainly looks striking.

1138
00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it is a bit messy, isn't it?

1139
00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And you made your fondant, didn't you?
-Yeah.

1140
00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And you didn't need to.
-No.

1141
00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:05.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Flo] The man's almond,
the other one is vanilla.

1142
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-There is not a lot of difference between.
-Not a lot of difference between the two.

1143
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are both great biscuits,
they are crumbly, they break easily,

1144
00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
there is no chew to it at all.

1145
00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Simplistic, but actually it does the job.

1146
00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, Flo.

1147
00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's getting bin bagged. After today.

1148
00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
You spin the compass and depending
on which number it lands on

1149
00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is how many spaces you move.

1150
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That works quite well, doesn't it?

1151
00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit rough and ready.

1152
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Its colourful which is a good thing.

1153
00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And the little boats
are quite neat.

1154
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The landmark is rum and ginger.

1155
00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's Scotland leaving England.

1156
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1157
00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You do want your own teeth,
I must tell you.

1158
00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Both the biscuits are burnt.
The flavours are okay.

1159
00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the most impressive
thing is your compass.

1160
00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No one has ever said that to me before.

1161
00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not your strong point then.

1162
00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think
it does look a little bit messy.

1163
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] I just didn't have time

1164
00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to like decorate it
in the way that I wanted to.

1165
00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it looks a little
more like a jungle swamp.

1166
00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the lemon and paradise one.

1167
00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am not getting the grains of paradise.

1168
00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] No, I can't taste them.

1169
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a little bit solid.

1170
00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think eating that is
going to be a huge pleasure.

1171
00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It looks a bit unfinished because
once the board was done

1172
00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you just spent the rest of the time
cutting out these shapes.

1173
00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could have decorated
them a little bit more.

1174
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fantastic flavour.

1175
00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The lemon honey and ginger is delicious.

1176
00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To get the honey, the lemon and ginger
all together is quite tricky to do.

1177
00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The board game is a chocolate
orange and cinnamon.

1178
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it's got chocolate chips in it.

1179
00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm-hmm.

1180
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to say I think
it's absolutely delicious.

1181
00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just crumbly and melting and yum.

1182
00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would like to see more decoration,

1183
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the biscuits are the star of the show.

1184
00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Which game do you want to play?
-Noughts and crosses.

1185
00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, you be the noughts.

1186
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, cool.

1187
00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You could have won?
-[Liam] I know.

1188
00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:25.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] Paul.
-I would never do that.

1189
00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1190
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

1191
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will be getting drunk tonight.

1192
00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Steven, would you like to bring
your biscuit board game up?

1193
00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Yeah, I think I'm gonna help.

1194
00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a bit scary.

1195
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1196
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is exceptional.

1197
00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1198
00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The work
that you have got on the top

1199
00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is sublime, it is very delicate.

1200
00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's a little masterpiece.

1201
00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have a great bake,
it's a great tasting gingerbread.

1202
00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's very good because the fondant
isn't too thick.

1203
00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

1204
00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The orange flavour is delicious.

1205
00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very well-designed
and it's as neat as a pin.

1206
00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Very, very clever,
well done, Steven.

1207
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Thank you.

1208
00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tom] Well done.

1209
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, mate.

1210
00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Stacey, please bring up
your biscuit board game.

1211
00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The board game is a made-up
game called Get to School.

1212
00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are three players,
I've got three boys.

1213
00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is so neat and so beautifully done.

1214
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The piping is good and the sweet,
little school blazer is just exquisite.

1215
00:52:58.560 --> 00:52:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stacey] That's vanilla and strawberry.

1216
00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Slightly chewy, quite rubbery.
-Yeah.

1217
00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sorry.
-Erm, I'm not getting much flavour.

1218
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
From an eating point of view,
that's much more icing

1219
00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
than you need on that bit of biscuit.

1220
00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The chocolate is dry as a bone.

1221
00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The texture is all wrong,
it just crumbles into nothing.

1222
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's a beautifully conceived game,

1223
00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the flavour and the texture
is not so wonderful.

1224
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you not think we look like four people

1225
00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who couldn't agree
what game they wanted to play?

1226
00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all chuckles]

1227
00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, we cut them all into bits.

1228
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] I loved this challenge,

1229
00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
an incredible array
of imagination on display.

1230
00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely, and some terrific skill, too.

1231
00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Steven's was exquisite.

1232
00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then Tom's, I mean,
that could have come out of a magazine.

1233
00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's the same
when you look at Sophie's

1234
00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the taste
of those biscuits were divine.

1235
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Chris came into
the showstopper in trouble.

1236
00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
His problem was that
he just never got near the end.

1237
00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Stacey's although, it looked great,
the biscuits were bone dry.

1238
00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know Kate struggled as well.

She didn't finish her bake.

1240
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] She is too ambitious.

1241
00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flo didn't do brilliantly today,
and she was not pleased with herself.

1242
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, it's not as clean cut as you think
when you look down at the bottom.

1243
00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It has got to be more
of a conversation about who is going.

1244
00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But I think we will agree
on who is star baker.

1245
00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think so.

1246
00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's my head.
-I know.

1247
00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm short enough.

1248
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, bakers, thank you
for some wonderful board games.

1249
00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have got the lovely job
of announcing star baker.

1250
00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The star baker this week

1251
00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
produced some exquisite detail
in the showstopper.

1252
00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The star baker is Steven.

1253
00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So of course, that means
I have the difficult job

1254
00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of announcing
who is going to be leaving us.

1255
00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The baker leaving the tent is...

1256
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chris.

1257
00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah.

1258
00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a surprise.

1259
00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, let's have a hug, come on.

[Chris] <i>I am disappointed I never got</i>

1261
00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
any pastries, the things
that fit my style of baking.

1262
00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am just so honoured
and privileged to have got in that tent.

1263
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything fell to pieces for him,
it's a real shame, you know,

1264
00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because he has got some fantastic ideas.

1265
00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right, mate, well done.

1266
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Are you happy to get through?
[Liam] Just a little bit.

1267
00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gulp. [laughs]

1268
00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dodged a bullet there
but, yeah, happy with that.

1270
00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am not disappointed I didn't get
star baker, maybe another week.

1271
00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The double.
-You're going for a double, he is greedy.

1272
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, he has done the double.

[Steven] <i>I don't think</i>
<i>I will ever get used to this feeling,</i>

1274
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's alien to me.

1275
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have bullied myself so much in my life

1276
00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that finally I am getting praise,
I don't know what to do with it.

1277

1278
00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I expected to go home.

1279
00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1280
00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You are not getting rid of me
that easy, are you?
