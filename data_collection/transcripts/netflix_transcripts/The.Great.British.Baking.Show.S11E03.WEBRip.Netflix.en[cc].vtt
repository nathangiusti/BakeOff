67
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

70
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
simple though it is,
is it does cover all the skills

71
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that really matter in bread making.

72
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need to spend time
developing that gluten,

73
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

74
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

75
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

76
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The joining of the two balls is important,

77
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and they must be stable

78
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and grow up, rather than flat,
you want a bit of height.

365
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've fumbled when you cut this
'cause it's all over the place.

407
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Doesn't look too bad.

408
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is a lot of filling,
but actually it works.

409
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing is overpowering anything else.

410
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Chilli's coming in at the end.
-[chuckles]

411
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's lovely.
-Thank you.

412
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] It's split quite badly,
this is down to underproving it.

413
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm-hmm.
-It needed another ten minutes.

414
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You got a great bake on it though.

415
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Certainly cheesy.
-[chuckles]

416
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Smokiness comes through beautifully,
cheese and chipotle as well.

417
00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is a bit doughty,
but your flavours are good.

418
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Hmm.

419
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks monstrous.

420
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How much flour did you use?

421
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Er, nigh on 700 grams.

422
00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a big loaf.

423
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] But the structure is spot on.

424
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Rowan] Yeah.
-[Paul] Great colour.

425
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The olives come through beautifully,
sundried tomatoes, not so much.

426
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can taste the sundried tomatoes,

427
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I don't think
the little Ss add anything.

428
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should've just written "Paul is king."

429
00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bread king.

430
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Rowan.
-Thank you.

431
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Monstrous.

432
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's fine, I've been called worse.
-[both laugh]

433
00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] It's dense inside.
-[Nicky] Yes.

434
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm getting salt.
-[Prue] Hmm, quite a lot of salt.

435
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's the level of salt you put in?

436
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The original prove was just seven grams
and then after that I just went…

437
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you added more.

438
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In with the paste.

439
00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just did a wee--
-Probably why we're picking it up then.

440
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Because you just went over that balance.

441
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Colour, I love.
Cuts, I like, Nice and deep.

442
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I think it looks really appetising.

443
00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Needs a bit of salt.

444
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Considering you had cranberries,
walnuts in there, it's a bit bland.

445
00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But overall, I think it's a decent loaf.
-Okay.

446
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
This is Flat Janice,
her cottage is a bungalow.

447
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abbi and Prue laughing]

448
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Let's have a look.

449
00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How much garlic
did you put in it, all of it?

450
00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not all of it. Like, six cloves.

451
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite strong.
Can't taste the rosemary.

452
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, okay.
-Erm…

453
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-When it comes to salt…
-[Abbi] Yeah.

454
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
…it's a bland loaf. All you get…

455
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is garlic.
-[Paul] …is garlic.

456
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not enough salt.
-[Abbi] Yeah.

457
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that's affected the structure
and that's why it'll look like this.

458
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Taste it with a bit of the crust,
'cause that's really nice.

459
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, yeah.
-Bit of salt on it, it'll be lovely.

460
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. Good job, Janice. [laughs]

461
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Lovely colour.

462
00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's turned out quite nicely.
You've pretty much got the proving right.

463
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The flavour is great.
-[Paul] Mmm.

464
00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Nice balance of cheese and chilli.

465
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is considerable heat in that.
I like it.

466
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's lovely.

467
00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm surprised. I thought cheese and olives
are gonna hold it down,

468
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's going to become claggy and…

469
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's lovely.

470
00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done, Josh.
-Thank you.

471
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispering] Well done.

472
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Phew. [laughs]

473
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] If you saw that
in a baker's shop, you'd buy it

474
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it looks
so rustic and so appetising.

475
00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Looks quite appealing, doesn't it?
-Hmm. Let's have a look.

476
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's clever,
the pesto going through it.

477
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My issue is it stays in one place. Have to
distribute it amongst the whole loaf.

478
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[crust crunches]

479
00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's a really
interesting delicious loaf.

480
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Flavour wise,
texture wise, great job.

481
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It just needed to be more uniform
with your filling. Pop it in the mixer,

482
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
all ingredients,
once you've proved your dough,

483
00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and just slowly turn it to introduce it
and then you shape it.

484
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I should've belled you beforehand.
-Yeah.

485
00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I was across there. [laughs]
-Give you a shout next time.

486
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, thank you very much.

487
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That'll do me.

488
00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both chuckle]

489
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Because you've put
weight in the dough as seeds,

490
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm thinking that this is gonna be
quite dense inside.

491
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the proof of the pudding
is in the eating.

492
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Go on then.

493
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would be so proud of that
if I'd done it.

494
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue and Paul chuckle]

495
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is dense
but nevertheless, it's delicious.

496
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not perfect.
But it is 90-odd percent there.

497
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm, I wish I'd made it.

498
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Well done. Thank you.

499
00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[whispers] Wow. She wishes she'd made it.

500
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll take that. [laughs]

501
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That went pretty well.

502
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's good feedback. [chuckles]
-[Tasha] Thank you, Prue.

503
00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it was lovely. [laughs]

504
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It went well. Phew.

505
00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Monstrous?

506
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd rather be monstrous than mediocre.

507
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] That was good.

508
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He liked the look of it. Had good colour.
One down two to go.

Oh, Flat Janice.
I'm definitely at the bottom.

510
00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But last week's technical, I won,
so hopefully, do a better job.

511
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Smash it.

[Alison] <i>The bakers were able</i>

514
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

515
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hello, welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your technical challenge.

516
00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which today, has been set for you
by the bad boy of buns himself,

517
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mr Paul Hollywood.

518
00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul has been preparing some incredible
words of wisdom. Over to you, Paul.

519
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all about the timing.

520
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm gonna put that on my Instagram.
-[laughs]

521
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This technical will be judged blind,
so we're gonna have to ask our judges

522
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to leave the tent.

523
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bye-bye.
-Thank you.

524
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To make sure there's no cheating,
they will be lowered into a medieval well.

[Alison laughs]

526
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison] Paul would like you to make

527
00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a batch of eight
delicious Devonshire splits.

528
00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ooh. I love Devonshire splits.
-What?

529
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do the splits
while eating Devonshire splits.

530
00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, the judges are looking for soft,
light and rich dough buns

531
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that are split and then filled
with a homemade strawberry jam,

532
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and freshly whipped cream.

533
00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. You have two hours and 30 minutes.

534
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] On your marks…
-Get set…

535
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[in Jamaican accent] Bake!

536
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, that's not
a lot of ingredients, is it?

537
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm familiar with a Devonshire split.

538
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like a doughnut,
and I love doughnuts.

539
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tasha] I live adjacent to Devon.

540
00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] I've never seen one before.

541
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bit worried. I need a good technical,
because I had a mediocre signature.

542
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, I'm just looking round.

543
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Do not confer," it says,
but it doesn't say, "Don't look."

544
00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, Paul, Devonshire splits. What a treat.

545
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I grew up on these. My dad
used to make these in his bakery.

546
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And they're just delicious.

547
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where they're gonna come unstuck
on this challenge is timing.

548
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've allowed for two proves in this.

549
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So, for the first prove?
-Well, you do it roughly 45 minutes.

550
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As it starts to rise,
carbon dioxide begins to be formed

551
00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and flavour comes into it.

552
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then they can prepare the rolls.

553
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They divide it into eight,
roll it into balls and prove it again.

554
00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Forty-five minutes on the second one,
stabilises the dough,

555
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and gives it better flavour.

556
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all down to the proving.
The oven bakes for around 15 minutes.

557
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want them
beautifully round and symmetrical.

558
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't want any tears
in the side at all

559
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you want a nice flash of colour
to the bottom.

560
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn't have thought a Devonshire split
could be so complicated.

561
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Now, no cutlery with this.

562
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is where we get cream
all over the show.

563
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Mmm-hmm.

564
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, yeah. It's soft in the mouth,
slightly chewy.

565
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is heaven.

566
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Beautiful sweetness
from the strawberry and the cream.

567
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going to sit here and eat the lot.

568
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not all those, but all of this.
-All of this.

569
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Nicky] "Step one, make the dough."

570
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's an enriched dough,
means it's enriched with milk and butter.

571
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'm adding that to my flour,
yeast, salt and sugar,

572
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
bring it together to form a scraggly dough
and then get that kneaded.

573
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get your hands in. Get in there.

574
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gonna need to work quickly.

575
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm keen to get my dough proving.

576
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You all right, Abbi?
-Hello, Alison.

577
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How're you doing?

578
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right. Thank you.

579
00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Devonshire splits.
Have you ever made these before?

580
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I haven't.

581
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you ever done the splits?
-No.

582
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both laugh]

583
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've gotta impress Paul with this.

584
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. Need to get myself back on track
after Flat Janice.

585
00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, Janice tasted amazing.

586
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She was very garlicky. The way I like it.

587
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Probably not what Prue wanted.
-So you've got to get this right.

588
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Keep kneading, babes.
-Thank you.

589
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] <i>Perfect Devonshire split dough…</i>

590
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can feel that changing under my hands.

591
00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>…requires lots of kneading.</i>

592
00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[panting] That's like a workout.

593
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>Not enough</i>
<i>and they could end up with tight buns.</i>

594
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs wearily]

595
00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're looking for something
very smooth and elastic.

596
00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't want it to tear.

597
00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's looking all right, that.
-Step five, "Prove."

598
00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thank you very much
for all that information.

599
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll give it as long as I can,
'cause I want it to be light and fluffy.

600
00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Saku] I'm going to leave this
for 50 minutes.

601
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Start with 30 minutes, check.
It'll need longer than that,

602
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but whether we've got time to do it
longer than that?

603
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's gonna be a lot of
underproved buns today.

604
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Next is to make the strawberry jam.

605
00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abbi] Chopped my strawberries,
put them in a pan with jam sugar,

606
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
hopefully I have the setting temperature
branded in my brain.

607
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm trying to get this to 104 Centigrades.

608
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Nicky] Here we go.
It's bubbling away now.

609
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bit longer.

610
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks all right. Hopefully it will work.

611
00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Steaming up, yes. [laughs]

612
00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Jam is ready.

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Cristy] Maybe I should
just present it on the side?

1229
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's okay, everything's still quite warm.

1230
00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Think that's a bit under.

1231
00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abbi] They do look like
little mushrooms, don't they?

1232
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison] Bakers, that is your time up.

1233
00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please step away from your showstoppers.

1235
00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I'm happy with that.

1236
00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's still up.
I've managed to get it up and keep it up.

1237
00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's turned out how I wanted to.
That's all I can ask for every time.

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Josh, bring your showstopper
to the front. Let's have a look.

1240
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's amazing.

1241
00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's really effective and you've
chosen wisely with the doughs

1242
00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:48.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to give you depth of colour
with the chocolate bread

1243
00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then the cranberry and orange one.

1244
00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you get the face shape
just by plaiting. It's absolutely amazing.

1245
00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does this mascot have a name?

1246
00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Was christened Paul by Alison.

1247
00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue chuckles]

1248
00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A beautiful christening. Was lovely.
-[Noel laughs]

1249
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's absolutely delicious.

1250
00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Fantastic flavour. I think it's gorgeous.
-Oh. Phew.

1251
00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's an enriched dough.

1252
00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've managed to achieve
the same texture in two doughs,

1253
00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-that's quite a trick.
-Very clever.

1254
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's ingenious.
It's well thought out and well executed.

1255
00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Excellent.
-Thank you.

1256
00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] The overall look of that
is beautiful.

1257
00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's really clever. Let's try this.

1258
00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Remind me of the flavours.
-[Nicky] It's pecan and date.

1259
00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've had a big lump
and there's nothing in there.

1260
00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It tastes lovely if you get a pecan.

1261
00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Nicky] So this is
Comté cheese and lardons.

1262
00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Certainly get the cheese.
-Do you?

1263
00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It's lovely.
-The cheese you get, there is no bacon.

1264
00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think your display's incredible.

1265
00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's down to distribution
of your flavours inside.

1266
00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I hope you're
allowed back in the ground, mate.

1267
00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh.
-[Prue laughs] That's…

1268
00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-That's a bit unkind.

1269
00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughter]

1270
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like your design. Lovely.
Like a bit of art.

1271
00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's try this one first.

1272
00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] This looks a bit biscuit-y.
-It's bone dry.

1273
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This looks more promising.

1274
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can see the structure
on that is so much better.

1275
00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the chillies.

1276
00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the bread is just beautiful.

1277
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bread is very good.

1278
00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Saku, would you like to bring up
your showstopper, please?

1279
00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you want a hand?

1280
00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, Saku, stop messing around.

1281
00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1282
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it looks great.
It's quite striking.

1283
00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But this is underproved.

1284
00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can see the split
all the way down the middle.

1285
00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Hmm, try that one.

1286
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Saku] That is spelt-seeded.

1287
00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite gluey in the mouth.

1288
00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm, it's a bit bland and a bit dense.

1289
00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm-hmm.
-[Paul] Remind us of the flavours?

1290
00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Saku] Rosemary and garlic.

1291
00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've certainly got the flavour,
but it's quite dry.

1292
00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's really impressive bread art.

1293
00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a little disappointing to eat.

1294
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1295
00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I have to say,
it looks absolutely fantastic.

1296
00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1297
00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You should be proud of your dad.
-Yeah. Thanks, John.

1298
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue chuckles]
-This is…

1299
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rowan] The wholemeal sweet curry.

1300
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is very strong.
-It's hideous, yeah.

1301
00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The dough is raw inside.

1302
00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's so, so dense.
There's so much curry in there.

1303
00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The yeast is going,
"Help me, I can't rise."

1304
00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-[Paul] Hmm, this is the…

1305
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] Smoked bacon,
rosemary and parmesan.

1306
00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It's quite heavy.
-Okay.

1307
00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Over-flavoured.

1308
00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the yeast is going,

1309
00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Not the second time, I still can't rise."

1310
00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it going to be the same for this?

1311
00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who knows?

1312
00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] This is the marzipan.
-[Rowan] Yeah.

1313
00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's more open.
-That looks lovely.

1314
00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is such a relief after
the strength of your other flavours.

1315
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the crust is absolutely delicious.

1316
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's not enough
to compensate for the other two.

1317
00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-[Paul] I'm just gonna…
-[Prue] That's what I wanted to do.

1318
00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The best of it is this beautiful plaiting
and frankly,

1319
00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've spoilt it
with this tat.

1320
00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Tat?
-[Alison] Tat.

1321
00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I thought that was one of your earrings.
-[laughs]

1322
00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] This one is…
-[Dana] Coriander and cumin.

1323
00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That is delicious.

1324
00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your flavours are absolutely spot on.

1325
00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just would've liked
a bit of crispiness on there.

1326
00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you're doing a basket,
take it off the bowl,

1327
00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause this has now gone soggy.

1328
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bread, as it's cooling,
is sweating on the bowl.

1329
00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I think it tastes great.

1330
00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] It's beautiful.

1331
00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My mouth's watering.
I actually want to eat it.

1332
00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But because you didn't get that in there,

1333
00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you don't see the glory
of the centrepiece.

1334
00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Let's have a look
at this one first.

1335
00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That looks beautiful, doesn't it?
It's very light.

1336
00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, good.

1337
00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a lovely challah,
the flavour's fantastic, texture's good.

1338
00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Let's taste that.

1339
00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. Lovely flavour.

1340
00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The nuts and the chocolate
work really well.

1341
01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're both very good breads.

1342
01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I think overall,
the design is rudimentary.

1343
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a what plait?

1344
01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A nine. That's the walnut and Stilton.

1345
01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Needs more Stilton.
There's definitely a flavour,

1346
01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but you can get much stronger flavour.

1347
01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the wild garlic and…

1348
01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abbi] And nettle.

1349
01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's extremely green, isn't it?
It feels as if it's doing you good.

1350
01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I like the flavour, it's unusual.

1351
01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But needs to be more open.
It's a bit dense.

1352
01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Cake-like.
-[Abbi] Mmm.

1353
01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I'm so interested
in that dock seed flour.

1354
01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's almost a pepperiness to it.

1355
01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like your flavours. They're unusual.
Some I've never had before, I like that.

1356
01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much.
-[Paul] Thank you, Abbi.

1357
01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These aren't baked.
I mean, that colour's wrong.

1358
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you run out of time and had to
take them out before they were baked?

1359
01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Paul] It's a shame.

1360
01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this all the same?

1361
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. Tuscan sausage, nduja, tomato,
mozzarella and basil.

1362
01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, it's quite powerful.

1363
01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's too doughy. More air, more bake.

1364
01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think this one might be
a little bit raw.

1365
01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's such a pity, because that
has the makings of a really good loaf.

1366
01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just so unlike you.

1367
01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I know, we all know
you can do a helluva lot better than that.

1368
01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan sighs]

1369
01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispers] Okay?

1370
01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I think it's beautiful.
It really is, it's a work of art.

1371
01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The hands are the most beautifully
plaited, look at those little fingers.

1372
01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The face has real expression,
quite sinister.

1373
01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the hair, very, very clever.

1374
01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've caught some of them in the oven.
It's gone a bit too dark.

1375
01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Yeah.
-[Paul] Let's try the pesto one.

1376
01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm.

1377
01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a really strong fresh pesto.
Just delicious.

1378
01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's very good.
Let's try the face, shall we?

1379
01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tasha] That's pastrami and cheese.

1380
01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tasha, you are one hell of a bread baker.

1381
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wow. [chuckles] Thank you.
-That is beautiful.

1382
01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stunning.

1383
01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wow.
-Never seen anything like that before.

1384
01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavours are good,
the textures are good.

1385
01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You understand bread and I like that.

1386
01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you.

1387
01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done, Tasha.
-Thank you.

1388
01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, Tash, amazing.

1389
01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, girl.

1390
01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

1391
01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I'm so happy. [laughs]

1392
01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That comment from Paul,

1393
01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that's the biggest win
of Bread Week for me,

1394
01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I understand bread.

1395
01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flipping heck.

1396
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's amazing.

1397
01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs in relief]

1398
01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Diabolical.

1399
01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul said monstrous yesterday,
hideous today.

1400
01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gonna get that tattooed.

1401
01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abbi] They did have their criticisms,
but they really liked my flavours.

1402
01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm aware that
because of how yesterday went,

1403
01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I might not have done enough.

1404
01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pretty gutted.
Erm, I was looking forward to Bread Week.

1405
01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue gave me some nice words
'cause she knows I can do it.

1406
01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know myself I can do it.

1407
01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, erm, I have a sense
I'm probably gonna go today.

1408
01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, Bread Week's ended up
as dread week, didn't it?

1409
01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, some of it was a bit disappointing.

1410
01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Some bakers
got a bit caught up with the plaiting

1411
01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and ignored the flavour and the texture.
Point in question would be Rowan.

1412
01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because however great that tree looked,

1413
01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that curry bread was,
I wouldn't say unedible,

1414
01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it was certainly on the way.

1415
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I was shocked with Dan.
-[Prue] Everything was raw.

1416
01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison] Is he in danger?

1417
01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He is. He did really well in the signature
but he's put himself down there.

1418
01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can we talk about Abbi?

1419
01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Abbi's had a bit of a shocker.

1420
01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The thing I loved was her foraging.

1421
01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Her flavours were unique, but overall,
it came down to textures.

1422
01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who really surprised you today?

1423
01:03:58.840 --> 01:03:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] You loved Tasha's?

1424
01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The flavours she achieved
was really nice.

1425
01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And she did it so beautifully.
Those hands are just exquisite.

1426
01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Same size as your hands.

1427
01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I know.
-[all laugh]

1428
01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I felt like Josh was really good.

1429
01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That was a great loaf.

1430
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So now for Star Baker,
I think it is between Josh and Tasha.

1431
01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Going home, it's between Dan, Abbi…

1436
01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Hi there, bakers,

1438
01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1439
01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And according to the judges,
they are absolutely smashing it.

1440
01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1441
01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tasha.

1442
01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1443
01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which means I've got the horrible job
of announcing the person who's leaving us.

1444
01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1445
01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1446
01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's okay.

1447
01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles softly]

1448
01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, well done.

1449
01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no.

1450
01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abbi] I knew it was coming.

1451
01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know what, I'm really proud of myself.

1452
01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And… sorry. [sniffles]

1453
01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1454
01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm absolutely gutted.

1455
01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I never thought I'd be able to do this.

1456
01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's given me a massive confidence boost,

1457
01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I've met such amazing people.

1458
01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'm gonna remember every day
for the rest of my life.

1459
01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm quite looking forward
to getting back to my vegetables.

1460
01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What am I gonna do without you?

1461
01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rowan] I do feel lucky.

1462
01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit bittersweet.
I'm devoed, 'cause I love Abbi.

1463
01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't want your friends to leave.

1464
01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're all friends, it's awful.

1465
01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1466
01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Abbi going is really tough.

1467
01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely girl, love her, she's brilliant.

1468
01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did enough to wiggle through,
can't afford another week like this.

1469
01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1471
01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bloody hell.

1472
01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1473
01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1474
01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's amazing.

1475
01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I go into things
with quite low expectations of myself and…

1476
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I need to
