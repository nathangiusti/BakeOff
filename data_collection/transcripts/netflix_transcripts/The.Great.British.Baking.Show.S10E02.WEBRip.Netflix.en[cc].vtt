Hey, Matt, I mean, it's Biscuit Week.
I'm pretty sure that's a cake.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

28
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So… Yeah, Biscuit Week.

29
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[nervously] Here I come.

[sing-song] Good luck everybody.

32
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I was near the bottom last week.
I'm feeling apprehensive.

33
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's more to prove,
and biscuits aren't really my thing.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Biscuits… Oh, I like to eat them.

36
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not really make them.

37
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Who makes biscuits nowadays?
You usually get it from the supermarket.

38
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Good morning, bakers.
Welcome back to the tent for Biscuit Week.

39
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, for your signature challenge,
these guys would like you to make

40
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a batch of 18 identical
decorative macarons.

41
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, that's macaron, the yummy biscuit,
Not Macron, the president of France.

43
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now they can be any flavour you like.

44
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They must be filled. But here's the twist,

45
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the decoration must make them look
like something other than a macaron.

46
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For instance, the president of France.

47
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Exactly.

48
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You have two hours

-[sing-song] Get set…
-Bake.

50
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here we go. [laughs nervously]

51
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Macarons aren't really my thing.

52
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
But it should be fun.

53
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
What could go wrong with a macaron?

54
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Everything. Everything could go wrong
with a macaron.

55
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
They can explode.

56
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
They can underbake,
they might stick to the mat.

57
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
There are 87 things that can go wrong.

58
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me, the perfect macaron
is very light, perfectly shaped,

59
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
outside, smooth and shiny
and crisp as anything.

60
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And inside, deliciously chewy.

61
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But we're not asking the bakers</i>
<i>for any old macaron.</i>

62
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They have to be shaped or decorated
to look like something else.

63
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We want to see colourful,
we want to see vibrance

64
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and we wanna see personality coming out.

65
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, chuck all that in now.

66
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The best way
to approach this challenge is simplicity.

67
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They've only got two hours.

68
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Produce something that packs a punch
and looks amazing.

69
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't try and overdo it at this stage.

70
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Morning, Carole.
-Morning.

71
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, Carole, tell us about your macarons.

72
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I decided to make little burgers.

73

-Yeah.

75
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

76
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It just reminds me of nice summer evenings
with friends and family.

77
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-[Prue] It doesn't taste of anything.

307
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's chicken satay,
in a bracket, "no chicken."

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Matt] Bakers, you have half an hour left.

313
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah? Dawn's finished, drink that in.

314
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is ridiculous. [chuckling]

315
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. They're in. Right, icing time.

319
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought I wouldn't be fanning stuff,
but here we are.

320
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're a bit flat, but they didn't
explode on the top. I'm happy about that.

321
00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're carrot-shaped, they're orange,
they're ticking some of the boxes,

322
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but my filling's not looking good.

323
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It just, sort of, curdled.

324
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I over mixed it.
So I need to restart that.

325
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Just as a tip for the future.
Paul hates tofu.

326
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's got, like, a real thing against tofu.

327
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Really? I'm a risk taker.
-[Noel] Yeah.

328
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] Are you?

329
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Syabira] Yeah.
-[Noel] I'm a risk taker too.

330
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's fun, isn't it?
-Yeah.

331
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carole] Right. Burger time. Not too much.

332
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dawn] The perfect amount of filling
is when you sandwich it together,

333
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you don't want it to kind of go
splurting out all over the place.

334
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[James] So this will be the cream border
that will hold the mango curd.

335
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] I think it's good,
but if Paul are not happy with it,

336
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
next time I'll make him a chicken satay,

337
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
send it to him. [laughing]

338
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The filling's definitely a lot better
than the first one.

339
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The first one was too runny.

340
00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I want to get moving, get those filled.

341
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then if I have enough time,
I'm gonna decorate.

342
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have 15 minutes remaining.

343
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rebs] They were way neater
and I was way quicker in practice.

344
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so far behind.

345
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All in all, not great.

346
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carole] Just popping
chocolate lettuce on,

347
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a little fondant, erm, tomato and cheese.

348
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-What are you doing there?
-I'm just adding some sprinkles.

350
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't over-egg it. They look like eggs.

351
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But in a good way.
-[chuckles]

352
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Egg daisies. [chuckles] No, they don't.

353
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're things of beauty
And they're dedicated to your children.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-What can go wrong?

355
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, Paul Hollywood,
that's what can go wrong.

356
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Spanner in the works.

357
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rebs] I really need to fill them.

358
00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers. You have one minute left.

359
00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Janusz, can you help me?

360
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maisam] Decoration's not happening.

361
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As long as they get macarons
that taste good.

362
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not doing anything extra today.

363
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you pipe that in the middle of this?

364
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This?
-Yeah, yeah.

365
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dawn] Ooh, string broke.

366
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Start putting them together,
you have nothing to present.

367
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Carole] Yeah.
-[Rebs] Okay.

368
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Faces on. Faces on.

369
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up.

370
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stressful.

371
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[in American accent] Please step away
from your macarons.

372
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Where'd you get the mango from?
-James.

373
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

374
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rebs] They look horrific.

375
00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Overall, I think
the design is pretty good.

376
00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a black cat. You can see that.
The interior looks a mess.

377
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah. [laughs]
-[Prue] The actual face is beautiful.

378
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Piping is perfect. So it's just the middle
that doesn't look good.

379
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the flavour is chocolate macaron
with a chocolate ganache

380
00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a raspberry coulis.

381
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I actually quite like them.
I like the flavour.

382
00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I just think they're a mess.
-[Prue] You didn't have time.

383
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-But you know that.

384
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes. Thanks.
-[Paul] Thank you, Rebs.

385
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-[Prue] I'd have liked them more domed.
-Okay.

386
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Especially if they should
look like a burger.

387
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Could have been
a bit darker with the bun.

388
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carole] Mmm.

389
00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're chocolate and orange,
some green chocolate for the lettuce,

390
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and little bits of fondant
for the cheese and tomato.

391
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] What orange did you use?

392
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Erm, essence.
-[Paul] Mmm…

393
00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you use any zest as well?

394
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No. Yeah?
-You should've done.

395
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I quite like the idea
of the chocolate, the orange.

396
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But, for me, it's the artificial flavour.

397
00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Carole] Okay.
-Mistake.

398
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
They look great.
I like the sesame seed on the top

399
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and how the burger
seems to hang over the edge.

400
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Are these fondant?
-[Sandro] Yes, they are.

401
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I got passion fruit
and lemon macarons.

402
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a passion fruit salted caramel
in the middle with a little bit of rum.

403
00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flavour is absolutely fantastic.

404
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-Not too much rum.

405
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just the right amount.
-Thank Goodness.

406
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you've done a good job.

407
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Thank you.

408
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

409
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs in relief]

410
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] They look great. You've got
a lovely dome on these and feet.

411
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I've decided to make
spinach-flavoured shells

412
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with just tiny bit of lemon.

413
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And inside you've got watermelon curd
and watermelon buttercream.

414
00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite dry on the outside, it should
be much more delicate than that, the skin.

415
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a shame because the shape,
the look, the flavour, I love.

416
00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've dried it out a bit too much.

417
00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And I agree with you completely.
-[Prue chuckles] Good.

418
00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, thanks.
-[all chuckling]

419
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I see what they are.
I think they're quite clever.

420
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So they are filled
with a raspberry double cream

421
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a mango curd.

422
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think your flavours are delicious.
It's nice and light.

423
00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The macaron is so thin, so it melts, just
leaving the beautiful flavours inside.

424
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the fruit gives it a bit of acidity

425
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which takes away
from the extreme sweetness.

426
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The balance of flavours is beautiful.
Imagination's fantastic.

427
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've achieved it really well.
-Thank you.

428
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've done better
than you thought you would.

429
00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Cheers, thank you.

430
00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] They look perfect little macarons.

431
00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice feet on the bottom. Crisp outside.

432
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Neat as a pin.
-[Paul] Yeah, very good.

433
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dawn] They've got a strawberry
mascarpone cream filling.

434
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] You're looking very anxious.
-I am.

435
00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, I love the flavour.
-Oh, good.

436
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-At first, it just…
-[Paul] Mmm…

437
00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Go on. Go on.
-No. [laughing]

438
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

439
00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[bakers applauding]
-[indistinct chattering]

440
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my goodness.

441
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The macaron is perfect.

442
00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely perfect.

443
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The idea of putting the string around,
as the fondant…

444
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just the interior, it lifts you up,

445
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause sometimes, er, inside of macarons
can be quite heavy.

446
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And dense. Mmm.
-That's also a really clever idea.

447
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's effective.
-It's amazing. Thank you.

448
00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks. Thanks so much.

449
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

450
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I'd have thought it was a balloon.

451
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A hot air balloon
rather than an ice cream.

452
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs to be much darker.
You don't get white cones.

453
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pink on the top's okay,
but it's down to the taste.

454
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Inside, we have a caramel coffee,
chocolate ganache.

455
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm.

456
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely delicious if you like coffee.

457
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Chocolate's lost
a bit in the coffee,

458
00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the salted caramel
you can't really taste either,

459
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Which is a shame. Hmm.
-[Prue] But it is delicious, all the same.

460
00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] You could sort of see what it is.
It probably needed a stronger colour.

461
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just so it looked more like a cone itself.

462
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, so it's a dark chocolate
ganache, with peppermint.

463
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Peppermint.

464
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It doesn't taste like toothpaste…

465
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-…you'll be pleased to hear.

466
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the mint's still a bit strong.

467
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The textures are all right, it's just
a question of flavours a little bit.

468
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Okay.

469
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
There is an effort there
to make a carrot shape.

470
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would like to see
maybe some pipe work on the top

471
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to really define

472
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-the sort of wrinkles in the carrots.
-Mmm-hmm.

473
00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The filling is a mascarpone cheese cream,

474
00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
crushed walnut
with orange blossom and cinnamon.

475
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The textures are spot on.

476
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me, the orange blossom
is just slightly too strong.

477
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Too strong.

478
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'd like to see a bit more definition
on the carrot.

479
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I agree that the look of it isn't perfect.

480
00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

481
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Nice height to the macaron.
You can see the feet there as well.

482
00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] You've done really well.

483
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's peanut satay macaron.

484
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And when you bite into it,

485
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you should taste the bits of tofu
with the ginger inside as well.

486
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That's very surprising.

487
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Initially, you get that sweet kick.

488
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then you get all the spices

489
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I love that flavour.

490
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then it goes back to sweet again.

491
00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which is a shame 'cause you
don't want to be left with the sweet.

492
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You want to be left with some savoury.
-Hmm.

493
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I think the satay is fantastic.
It really is beautiful.

494
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay. Thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you.

495
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Firstly, they look great.
They're very neat, very delicate.

496
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] They have little feet.
-[Paul] And they're nice and smooth.

497
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice shine to them as well.

498
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

499
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flavours are raspberry mascarpone cream.
And salted caramel.

500
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That is delicious.

501
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Got a little bit of acidity,
which is lovely.

502
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I love it.
-[Paul] Hmm.

503
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] Thank you.

504
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Hmm.

505
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks.
-That's delicious.

506
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's really light.

507
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Light, it melts in your mouth.
-Summery.

508
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the whole thing is so delicate.
That saltiness comes through as well.

509
00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Well done, Maxy.

-Thank you so much.
-Thank you. [chuckles]

511
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[squeals] Good God.

512
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was so worried,
'cause I hate macarons so much.

513
00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughing] But it worked!
And they loved it.

514
00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so happy.

515
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't wanna cry. [laughing]

516
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Two handshakes?

517
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That was crazy.
That… that was absolutely insane.

518
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think my family are just gonna go mad.
They're gonna be so excited.

519
00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The comments were just as I expected.

520
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, in terms of decoration,
just an extra ten minutes

521
00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
would have just made those macarons super.

522
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rebs] Oh, I definitely think
I'm dead-set last, 100%.

523
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really need to step it up.

524
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not confident
about the technical bake.

525
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What could it be?

526
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If it's like shortbread, it's easy-peasy.

527
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I doubt it will be that.

528
00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>The bakers</i>
<i>could practise their macaron,</i>

529
00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>but they have no idea</i>
<i>what they'll be asked to make next.</i>

530
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, bakers, it's time
for your technical challenge,

531
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which today has been set
by footballing legend Wayne Prue-ney.

532
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all chuckling]

533
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wayne, any, er, words of advice?

534
00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is an absolute classic.

535
00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't get creative,

536
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
just stick to the recipe
and don't dare disappoint.

537
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As ever, the technical challenge
will be judged blind.

538
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we have to ask these two
to go and play outside.

539
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you hold hands, please,
when you're crossing the road?

540
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For this week's technical challenge,

541
00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue would like you
to make 12 Garibaldi biscuits.

542
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Otherwise known as squashed fly biscuits.

543
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On account of the dried fruit
looking a little bit like squashed flies.

544
00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now you can use actual squashed flies
in your recipe, but I will say in advance,

545
00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
how sorry we are to see you
leave this early in the competition.

546
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You have one hour and 45 minutes.
-[Noel] On your marks…

547
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get set…
-Flies.

548
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt laughing]

549
00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kevin laughing]

550
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rebs] Squashed fly biscuits.
That's what my mum's called them.

551
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I've had them,
but I've never made them.

552
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm well chuffed. I know what it is.

553
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was up till 2:00 a.m.,
reading about biscuits.

554
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never heard of it or eaten it before,
so this is the first time I'm hearing it.

555
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No clue. I'm literally just baking.

556
00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, Prue, Garibaldi biscuits.
Interesting technical challenge.

557
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, yes. They sound simple,
but they're quite tricky.

558
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where could they go wrong?

559
00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] You need to roll the dough
really thin.

560
00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You want the crisp biscuit,

561
00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but slightly bendy, soft middle,

562
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a thin line of fruit.

563
00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got the addition of chocolate.

564
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Chocolate is not, erm…
[chuckles] classically Garibaldi.

565
00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I want to see
how skilful they are at feathering.

566
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When you pick it up, there's stability.

567
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit soft under the finger.

568
00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you know you've got
something that's quite…

569
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-solid
-Yeah.

570
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hmm.
-[Paul] Mmm.

571
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a flavoursome biscuit.
-It's absolutely delicious.

572
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure we'll probably get
11 different types of Garibaldi biscuit.

573
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I'm hoping to see
11 pretty well like that.

574
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fat chance. [chuckles]

575
00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the first step is chop
and soak the fruit in the orange juice.

576
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm trying to get them fly-size,

577
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I won't chop the currants
'cause they're tiny.

578
00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It doesn't say for how long,

579
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I guess I'll soak them
until I do my dough.

580
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Make the dough and chill." Very helpful.

581
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She gave us a few clues
like the butter's in small cubes,

582
00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which means you make wee bread crumbs.

583
00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My signature didn't go as I expected it.

584
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not in a good position.

585
00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stressed. [chuckles]

586
00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carole] …then I'll add the sugar,
then I'll add the egg.

587
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Did you get a handshake?
-[Dawn] Yes.

588
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Washed it yet?
-Of course I have.

589
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you? Washed off the Hollywood?
-Yeah.

590
00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I washed off the Hollywood.
-You never do that.

591
00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm--
-You let it seal up like a resin.

592
00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Then you peel it off like a glove.
-Do you?

593
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice and soft. Is it too soft? Who knows?

594
00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dawn] Gonna put it in the fridge, now.

595
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Starting to, sort of,
visualise what they look like.

596
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It should be a layer of biscuit,

597
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a layer of fruit
and then layer of biscuit.

598
00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This looks wrong.

599
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, flip's sake. [laughs]

600
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just realised I didn't read it.
I put the fruit in here.

601
00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Hi, how are you?
-Not great.

602
00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How was the handshake?
-It was amazing.

603
00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But now I'm messing this up.
What do you think about this?

604
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know what that is.

605
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think he might take his handshake back.

606
00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughing]
-[Noel] He does do it occasionally.

607
00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] Oh, no! I have to start again here.

608
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-"Drain and dry the fruit."
-Do you need that to be quite dry?

609
00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] This'll look good for my arms.

610
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-What biscuits do you like?

611
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ginger nut.
-Ginger nut?

612
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm boring, but I like a 30p pack
of, you know, ginger nut that'll do me.

613
00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you like pink wafer?

614
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I do actually like pink wafer.
-They're nice. Custard cream?

615
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Any biscuits you don't like?

616
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The Garibaldi. [laughs]

617
00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Forget it.

618
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is actually a lesson to learn.

619
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I should pay attention to the recipe.

620
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel so silly.

621
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna try to catch up
with everyone, if I can.

622
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Matt, do you wanna do
the time call or shall I?

623
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I'm Matt, that's Dave Plate.

624
00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. I always get you two mixed up.

625
00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll do it.

626
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you are halfway through.

627
00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"So cut the dough in half and roll out
each piece in a rectangle."

628
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looking at the sizes,
you've got to roll it quite thin.

629
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] I think that's good.
It's quite thin.

630
00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Sprinkle evenly with the fruit."

631
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Question now,
do they want <i>all</i> of the fruit?

632
00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rebs] Like, that's a fly graveyard.
That's too many flies.

633
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I've got a cup of tea
and I want a biscuit,

634
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I always imagine, "Mmm, fly graveyards."

635
00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[giggles]

636
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Lay the second rectangle
of pastry on top."

637
00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So that means it's just basically
dough, fruit and dough.

638
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now I'm just gonna cut this into 12.

639
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandro] I'm going to mark it.
-[Carole] I have to work it out.

640
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] This is maths.
-This is maths now.

641
00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which I was never good at.

642
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't feel like sticking around

643
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-for you doing maths.
-[laughs] No.

644
00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kevin] If the rectangle's 9 cm wide
and there were 12 of them,

645
00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then 3.5 cm times 12, 35…

646
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just gonna do it roughly,
literally eyeball this thing.

647
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not sure this is maths,
what you're doing. [laughs]

648
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is really--

649
00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If maths was like this at school,
I probably would have liked it.

650
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know.

651
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sort of poking stuff with a knife,
mumbling. [laughing]

652
00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll just cut them into 12.

653
00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Janusz] Oh, no.
-[Rebs] How many have you made?

654
00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I've made 24.
-[Rebs] Why?

655
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] That happens
when you don't know what you're doing.

656
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll just freeze them together
and put them really close.

657
00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would've left it
in the fridge a bit longer,

658
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I just need to catch up. [chuckles]

659
00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, they're going in.

660
00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oi, one, two, three.

661
00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] Putting them in now.
[exclaims, laughs]

662
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[James] Here we go.

663
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] Okay, bake well.
Don't disappoint me, guys.

664
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Say a prayer.
-I don't know how long they need to bake.

665
00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna do ten minutes to start with
and see what happens.

666
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna do 15 minutes.

667
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm putting about 12 minutes
because I'm not sure what I'm looking for.

668
00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once they kind of look like biscuits,
I'll just take them out.

669
00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll try to remember how it looks like
and then I will know how long to bake it.

670
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh!

671
00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. I think I remember.

672
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite pale.

673
00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. I think I get it.

674
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

675
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And I have no legs left.
-[chuckles]

676
00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I told you I was heavier than I look.
-It's fine.

677
00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm made of strontium.

678
00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maxy] I'm gonna go straight in.

679
00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Should've gone this fast from the start.
Oh, my goodness.

680
00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The colour's looking nice. Looking golden.

-[timer beeping]

682
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rebs] Don't know if they're ready or not.

683
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[James] Don't think
they're meant to be golden brown.

684
00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think they're meant to be
like a light toasted brown.

685
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-I'm gonna bake another five minutes.

686
00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I know they don't need to be too dark,
but I want them to be golden.

687
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are looking… [sighs]

688
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
…okay-ish.

689
00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know
if this will eventually, like, cool down

690
00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to be a much more tougher one
or will it just stay like that, soggy.

691
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because that's not what I want.

692
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They stuck together really nicely.
They're not breaking.

693
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm quite happy
that I could save the situation.

Oh, dear.

696
00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're brown enough.

Garibaldi biscuits in a packet.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not dipping, I'll just drizzle.

704
00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] They're just too fiddly to dip.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then I'll run a cocktail stick through.

[Maisam] Oh, wow! Actual feathers.

726

That looks amazing.

Okay, bakers,
it's time to invite the judges back in.

That's wonderful. Look at that. Feathers.

733

-[Prue] Wonderful.

734
00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Start with number one.

735
00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Nice feathering.
-The actual biscuit looks not too bad.

736
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's nice and thin.

737
00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

738
00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the chocolate's a bit too thick.

739
00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But it tastes good.
-The flavour's okay, though.

740
00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just a little bit soft.
Moving on to this one.

741
00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very nice feathering.
You can see the currants coming through.

742
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Yeah.
-[Prue] I like that.

743
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very soft again.

744
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think that's a lot to do with
not drying the fruit out properly.

745
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's soaking in and being absorbed
into the biscuit itself, yeah.

746
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bit pudding-y, but it's delicious.
-[Paul] Hmm.

747
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughing] The next one's
actually got a feather on the top.

748
00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's quite original.
-It's ridiculous, that's what it is.

749
00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-That's genius, Paul.

750
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not what we asked for, though.

751
00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're thin
and it has stayed in the middle.

752
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit soft.

753
00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, this one is…
They're very uneven, the biscuits.

754
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That one is a bit peculiar.

755
00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah. Tastes good.
-[Prue] Nice, crisp pastry, though.

756
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] These are thick with chocolate.
-[Prue] The feathering's good.

757
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] The feathering's nice.
-Nice and crisp.

758
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Hmm.
-[Prue] Good biscuit, that.

759
00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] These look quite thick.

760
00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're not the right size.
-Not flat and rectangular.

761
00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're lovely and buttery.
-Yeah.

762
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could have got more
if you'd rolled it thinner.

763
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Rolled them out thinner.

764
00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are fingers.
Lot of chocolate on there.

765
00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] They look properly baked.
-[Paul] Mmm.

766
00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are crispy. Taste is good.
Just the wrong shape and too thick.

767
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Er, moving onto… this mess.
-[Prue] This is not good.

768
00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. [laughs]

769
00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
More chocolate on the plate
than on the biscuits.

770
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughing] What is that?
-It will taste lovely, I promise you.

771
00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Needed longer in the oven.
-That's one of the problems.

772
00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's one, the feather is the other one.
And the chocolate is the other.

773
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue chuckles]
-It needed longer in the oven as well.

774
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, look at these. [chuckles]

775
00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Chocolate's all over the place.
And the wrong shape.

776
00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nice and crisp,
but they are a little overbaked.

777
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bit rustic.
-[Paul] Very thick, aren't they?

778
00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nicely baked.

779
00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] This is more the shape.
It's like they've made, er, two.

780
00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] They're doubles.
-[Paul] I think I've got too much.

781
00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm gonna join them together.
-[Prue] Yes.

782
00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They taste all right.

783
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's nice and thin.

784
00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks a bit messy, but the bake is right.

785
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Hmm.

786

[Matt] <i>Paul and Prue will now</i>

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it's a feather. [laughs]

793
00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we'd like to see it in the chocolate.

794
00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

was the little bit too much chocolate.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Proper chocolate, rich, indulgent.

[Prue] Very nice shortbread.

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's always a danger with rose
that it tastes so artificial.

1231
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anyway, it's lovely.

[Paul] The mask biscuit,
it's not particularly strong in lemon.

1233
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:40.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Having said that, I think
all your other biscuits are amazing.

1234
00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And what a design.

1235
00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1236
00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It is exceptionally pretty.
And you can wear it, can you?

1237
00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:54.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-I'd like to see you wear it, Paul.

1238
00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really would.

1241
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Strawberry and elderflower

1242
00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's absolutely delicious.
That's a really fresh kick of strawberry.

1243
00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With the white chocolate,
works really well.

1244
00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1245
00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] That is a real horror story.

The detail is incredible.

1248
00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a brandy snap base.

1249
00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Paul] Brandy snap's good. Really crispy.

1254
00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think overall you've done
a fantastic job to create that.

1255
00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lots of thought,
lots of different techniques.

1256
00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1257
00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It has brandy snap seaweed on one side,

macaron barnacles on the other,

1259
00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not much of a macaron.
-[Prue] Nice favour. But overbaked.

1260
00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Brandy snap is good.

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] This is sugar biscuit.
-Flavoured with Szechuan pepper.

1262
00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never had that, I really like that.

1263
00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've pulled it off.
The whole thing is a joy.

1264
00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
To have achieved that much accuracy
and delicacy without piping,

1265
00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is quite amazing.

1266
00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] It's a 3-D mosaic.
-[Prue] Mmm.

1267
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the tahini.

1268
00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-Texture's wonderful.

1269
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very short.

1270
00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I find the tahini flavour
so unusual, but I think it works.

1271
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] And this one?
-[Abdul] Sumac.

1272
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's a great biscuit.
-[Prue] Mmm.

1273
00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely zing to it.

1274
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Abdul, you have done an exceptional job.

1275
00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tastes great.

1276
00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Well, I must say,
I think it looks totally amazing.

1277
00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like a little burst of happiness.

1278
00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the design is very good.

1279
00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the amount of detail
you've gotten out of it as well.

1280
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But what do the biscuits taste like?

1281
00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, it's a lemon, lime
and coconut sugar biscuit,

1282
01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
decorated with the tuiles.

1283
01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These are very good.

1284
01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're really beautiful.

1285
01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What about these?
-[Paul] Florentines?

1286
01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Nice.
-Florentine's good as well.

1287
01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overall, fantastic design, great flavours
and well-thought-through.

1288
01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And good texture, which is difficult.
-Hmm.

1289
01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thanks.
-Thanks.

1290
01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Well done, Maxy.
-Thank you.

1291
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] The steampunk bit is wonderful.

1292
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The definition of the little cogs
and everything's terrific.

1293
01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just would like
to be able to see out of the mask.

1294
01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You needed to cut the eyes out.

1295
01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can do that for you.

1296
01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, go ahead.
-[both chuckle]

1297
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not getting much lemon,

1298
01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but I like the ginger biscuit taste.
-[Dawn] Right.

1299
01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] A beautiful blend
of ginger and spices.

1300
01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I agree. The gingerbread is delicious.

1301
01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you've done a good job.

1302
01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, well done.
-Thanks.

1303
01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Clever.

1304
01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, it's certainly
the most perfect example of cubism.

1305
01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah, I'll try this one.

1306
01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Er, this is a Polish spice biscuit.

1307
01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's Christmas right there.
-Hmm, I love that.

1308
01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Punches you with the flavour.

1309
01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1310
01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We had a little bit of a problem
right at the end.

1311
01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a shame. I can see
the detail that's gone into it.

1312
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, your recipe,

1313
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the amount of lard that's gone in there,
it's not stable enough.

1314
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's so soft. I'm not putting pressure.

1315
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Baking it a little more may have helped.

1316
01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the piping is beautiful.

1317
01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are these made of?

1318
01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carole] So you've got almond, er,
macarons and, erm, orange zest tuiles.

1319
01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're lovely.

1320
01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Macarons are delicious, too.
Really get the almond in there.

1321
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a shame 'cause it's beautiful,
and I love the taste of those and those.

1322
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beautiful.

1323
01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I think it's very charming.

1324
01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's perhaps a little small.

1325
01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-I think you could've done more.

1326
01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it is small.

1327
01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tell me the flavour.

1328
01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, so it's like a mixed spice biscuit.

1329
01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the spices are too hot
for a ginger biscuit.

1330
01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite soft.

1331

In fact, it's more cookie-like
than it is biscuit-like.

1332
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you could be
a fascinator designer.

1333
01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Or a milliner.
-[Paul chuckles]

1334
01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Mmm. Thank you.

1335
01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Thank you, Rebs.

1336
01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] It's pretty.
I like the colours. It's vibrant.

1337
01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Remind us of the biscuit again?

1338
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Er, it's gingerbread.

1339
01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite thick.

1340
01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hmm.
-[Paul] But it's baked okay.

1341
01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the butterfly biscuit.

1342
01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a nice design.
It's simple but effective.

1343
01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think in an ideal world,
I'd have liked you to do a little more.

1344
01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1345
01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know.
I wouldn't say I'm in a safe position.

1346
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could have done a lot more
with the time that I had,

1347
01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I definitely done something
that I'm proud of.

1348
01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I do go through,
it will be by the skin of my teeth.

1349
01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, I did have a good day yesterday,

1350
01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but is it enough to keep me in?

1351
01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't know.

1352
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I definitely focus on the negatives
more than the positives,

1353
01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I don't think
there were many positives to focus on.

1354
01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I just hope that my technical
kind of helps me a bit.

1355
01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>It's decision time</i>
<i>for Prue and Paul.</i>

1356
01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Who will be crowned Star Baker,</i>

1357
01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and whose time in the tent</i>
<i>has come to an end?</i>

1358
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, those masks
were pretty impressive, weren't they?

1359
01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Amazing. You know,
this lot are really imaginative.

1360
01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] I thought James' bake
was very inventive.

1361
01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Oh, amazing.

1362
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Really clever. I thought his flavours--
-He could get Star Baker.

1363
01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think he's in line for Star Baker.
I think Maxy's in line.

1364
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Has Syabira done enough to go up there?

1365
01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Possibly. But she struggled
in the technical.

1366
01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Carole's obviously in trouble.

1367
01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She chose the wrong recipe for that mask.

1368
01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was too thick, underbaked,
too much lard. It just collapsed.

1369
01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Maisam is in trouble.

1370
01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:06.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, her mask was okay,
and I can't really go past that.

1371
01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Compared to the others,
she wasn't up there.

1372
01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it looked good.
And I found Rebs' really good.

1373
01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But when you looked around the room
and saw shape-wise what Maxy did,

1374
01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
what Abdul did,

1375
01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then you realise that in this show
you do have to go the extra mile.

1376
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think, for that reason,

1377
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've got to put Rebs,
Maisam and Carole…

1378
01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Yeah.
-…right down at the bottom.

1379
01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think one of those three will leave.

1380
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not easy
to pick a Star Baker this week

1381
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because everybody did a great job.

1382
01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we have to pick one of you.

1383
01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So the Star Baker this week is…

1384
01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maxy.

1385
01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh! That leaves me with the horrible job
of announcing the person who's leaving us,

1386
01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is extra horrible because we've got
to know you all so well so quickly.

1387
01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the person who is leaving us is…

1388
01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maisam.

1389
01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry.

1390
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[softly] Maisam…

1391
01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rebs clicks tongue]

1392
01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Maisam] I think I'm definitely proud
because, obviously, I'm only 18.

1393
01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, at this age, I've definitely
done something to be proud of.

1394
01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And this is definitely
not the end of my baking journey.

1395
01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's where it starts.

1396
01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You got on
<i>The Great British Bake Off.</i>

1397
01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At 18 years old.

1398
01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not many people do that, not at your age.
-Eighteen years old.

1399
01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rebs] I'm happy
that I'm still here, obviously,

1400
01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I'm so sad for Maisam.

1401
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just so sad
that she's going so early.

1402
01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Next week
don't make any more mistakes.

1403
01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. No, I won't. [sniffles]

1404
01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, that was an emotional ride.
That one.

1405
01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. I really do need
to pull my socks up now.

1406
01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've had a second chance,
so I need to take it in both hands.

1407
01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't believe I got Star Baker.

1408
01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't think I'd get on to the show,

1409
01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
let alone get a handshake
and become Star Baker.

1410
01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm really happy.

1411
01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's definitely given me
a confidence boost.

1412
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, so yeah, I am really happy.
Looking forward to next week.
