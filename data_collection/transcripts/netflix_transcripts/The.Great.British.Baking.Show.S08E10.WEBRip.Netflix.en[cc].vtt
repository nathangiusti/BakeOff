363
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Part of the problem,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>it could be the flavours</c.bg_transparent>

994
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>Yeah, I think I took them out</c.bg_transparent>

995
00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

<c.bg_transparent>[Paul] The flavour's good,</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>but the dough is tough.</c.bg_transparent>

998

1002
00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

<c.bg_transparent>by having a wet filling.</c.bg_transparent>

1004
00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<c.bg_transparent>Cream needed to be a bit thicker.</c.bg_transparent>
