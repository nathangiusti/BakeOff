-Hello, Antony.
-Hello, you guys.

411
00:17:55.045 --> 00:17:57.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Fascinating looking biscuit.
Those colours are incredible.

412
00:17:57.845 --> 00:18:00.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Brilliant, they are quite psychedelic.
Love that.

413
00:18:00.285 --> 00:18:03.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think they look like little
modern art, they're so pretty.

414
00:18:03.325 --> 00:18:05.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Prue, you just like them
'cause they match your outfit.

415
00:18:12.485 --> 00:18:15.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know what? That texture is beautiful.

416
00:18:16.365 --> 00:18:17.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Melts in your mouth.

417
00:18:17.845 --> 00:18:20.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that chilli jam blends
gorgeously with it.

418
00:18:20.485 --> 00:18:21.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Paul.
-That's a, that's a great biscuit.

419
00:18:22.325 --> 00:18:23.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Boom!

420
00:18:23.485 --> 00:18:25.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'll take that.
-Absolutely. Simply wonderful.

421
00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have to take one away with me.

422
00:18:27.125 --> 00:18:27.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

423
00:18:28.285 --> 00:18:29.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

424
00:18:33.685 --> 00:18:35.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] I think your piping work
is beautiful. It does look amazing.

425
00:18:37.685 --> 00:18:39.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Nice and spicy. Very chewy.

426
00:18:40.765 --> 00:18:43.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't like the texture.
It's like a very, very small cookie.

427
00:18:43.685 --> 00:18:44.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It didn't blow me away.

428
00:18:44.725 --> 00:18:47.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I'll take a lot back
from that anyway. That's it.

429
00:18:50.245 --> 00:18:52.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
They are absolutely exquisite.

430
00:18:52.805 --> 00:18:54.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Aw!
-I just love them.

431
00:18:56.605 --> 00:18:57.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Beautifully balanced biscuit,

432
00:18:57.965 --> 00:19:00.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you break into it and then it instantly
starts to melt in your mouth

433
00:19:00.485 --> 00:19:01.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the beautiful flavours come out.

434
00:19:01.845 --> 00:19:04.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's enough acidity from the orange
to make your mouth water.

435
00:19:04.925 --> 00:19:05.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

436
00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:10.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] It looks quite pale.

437
00:19:12.125 --> 00:19:15.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do think it is a tiny bit under baked.

438
00:19:15.325 --> 00:19:16.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite bland.

439
00:19:16.365 --> 00:19:19.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is down to the bake,
it needs another three, four minutes.

440
00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:20.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cheers.

441
00:19:25.765 --> 00:19:27.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
First of all, they are extremely neat.

442
00:19:28.005 --> 00:19:28.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the look of them.

443
00:19:31.605 --> 00:19:32.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Ooh, very nice.

444
00:19:33.085 --> 00:19:34.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The biscuit is beautifully baked.

445
00:19:34.685 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It melts in the mouth, it's buttery.

446
00:19:36.245 --> 00:19:38.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love chocolate and I love hazelnut,

447
00:19:38.565 --> 00:19:41.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so you just ticked two boxes there for me.
That's a fantastic biscuit.

448
00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:42.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Manon] Thank you.

449
00:19:42.685 --> 00:19:44.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would be nice with a glass of milk too.

450
00:19:44.245 --> 00:19:45.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, it's there.
-Well done.

451
00:19:45.845 --> 00:19:47.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Thank you very much.

452
00:19:48.965 --> 00:19:50.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Good.
-Thank you.

453
00:19:53.085 --> 00:19:55.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Noel] I like this,
it's like owl feathers.

454
00:19:57.045 --> 00:19:59.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But it has a lot of flavours in it.
-[Rahul] Yeah, it has.

455
00:19:59.645 --> 00:20:03.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think the fennel
has quite the punch you thought it has.

456
00:20:03.605 --> 00:20:05.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay. Yeah.
-[Paul] Thank you.

457
00:20:07.805 --> 00:20:08.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] The reason why you've got 25?

458
00:20:09.845 --> 00:20:10.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm bad at maths.

459
00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:15.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know, they taste a bit dry.

460
00:20:16.565 --> 00:20:18.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's like a dried sponge
rather than a biscuit.

461
00:20:18.845 --> 00:20:19.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very difficult to eat.

462
00:20:20.005 --> 00:20:21.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Do you want to taste the tea, Paul?

463
00:20:22.525 --> 00:20:24.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, that's wet. They're dry.

464
00:20:24.285 --> 00:20:26.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great. Phew.

465
00:20:29.565 --> 00:20:31.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] They are quite pale looking.

466
00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:34.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is tough.

467
00:20:34.205 --> 00:20:35.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it?

468
00:20:35.125 --> 00:20:37.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's a bit chewy.
[Paul] That's not a shortbread.

469
00:20:37.325 --> 00:20:39.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needed longer in the oven.
The flavours are great.

470
00:20:39.925 --> 00:20:41.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that jam's delicious.

471
00:20:41.165 --> 00:20:42.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just don't like eating it?

472
00:20:42.245 --> 00:20:44.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything else terrible. Thank you.

473
00:20:47.485 --> 00:20:48.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Hello, Terry.
[Terry] Hello, Paul.

474
00:20:49.525 --> 00:20:52.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, okay, this is interesting. Um...

475
00:20:52.805 --> 00:20:55.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not my finest hour.
The lamb is not good, is it?

476
00:20:55.365 --> 00:20:56.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Love it, it's like a Warhol print.

477
00:20:57.645 --> 00:21:00.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. I don't like the colour,
I don't like the look of them.

478
00:21:00.165 --> 00:21:01.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are not neat enough for me.

479
00:21:01.765 --> 00:21:02.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

480
00:21:03.365 --> 00:21:04.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Right.

481
00:21:09.045 --> 00:21:11.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are a little bit hard. Great flavour.

482
00:21:11.565 --> 00:21:13.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just that, you know,
the execution is a bit of a mess.

483
00:21:13.965 --> 00:21:15.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

484
00:21:16.205 --> 00:21:18.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a rough old biscuit, that one.

485
00:21:18.165 --> 00:21:19.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never mind.

486
00:21:19.085 --> 00:21:20.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Terry, thank you.
-Live to fight another day perhaps.

487
00:21:20.765 --> 00:21:22.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Onwards and upwards indeed, thank you.

488
00:21:22.805 --> 00:21:25.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can do it.
You can be the comeback kid,

489
00:21:25.125 --> 00:21:26.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you can be the comeback kid.

490
00:21:27.205 --> 00:21:28.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's hope so, Noel.

491
00:21:30.005 --> 00:21:32.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] I think they look great.
They look like a proper gingernut.

492
00:21:32.325 --> 00:21:34.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm, ginger's lovely. Just right.

493
00:21:35.405 --> 00:21:37.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The lime, however, it just isn't there.

494
00:21:37.445 --> 00:21:39.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It does need a bit more lime. Nice though.

495
00:21:39.485 --> 00:21:40.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can breathe now.

496
00:21:46.965 --> 00:21:48.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] They look very neat.

497
00:21:48.165 --> 00:21:49.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Imelda] I'm scared.

498
00:21:49.405 --> 00:21:50.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Break well.
-Okay.

499
00:21:55.725 --> 00:21:57.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a delicious biscuit.

500
00:21:58.005 --> 00:21:58.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very oaty.

501
00:21:59.085 --> 00:22:01.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, feels healthy. Well done.
-No, it's not.

502
00:22:01.725 --> 00:22:03.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-But it is worth the calories.

503
00:22:03.485 --> 00:22:04.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely. [laughs]

504
00:22:04.805 --> 00:22:06.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

505
00:22:08.085 --> 00:22:09.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Hi, Briony.
[Briony] Hello.

506
00:22:09.485 --> 00:22:10.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Looks good.
-Thank you.

507
00:22:11.565 --> 00:22:14.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And they are pretty uniform
in colour and size.

508
00:22:14.245 --> 00:22:15.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're very neat.

509
00:22:15.205 --> 00:22:18.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I certainly like the scalloped edges.
I think that looks beautiful.

510
00:22:18.765 --> 00:22:19.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

511
00:22:22.445 --> 00:22:24.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The shortbread is really
melt-in-the-mouth and crumbly.

512
00:22:24.765 --> 00:22:25.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you think about the egg yolk?

513
00:22:26.565 --> 00:22:28.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's probably the best shortbread
here today.

514
00:22:28.605 --> 00:22:30.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm gonna try.
-Oh good.

515
00:22:30.285 --> 00:22:32.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's a crumbly, soft,

which comes from the apple,

00:22:34.685 --> 00:22:37.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the cider, and the caramelisation
on the top, the sweetness,

518
00:22:37.685 --> 00:22:40.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it just blows your mind.
It's a great biscuit, that.

00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:41.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:22:41.885 --> 00:22:42.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:48.565 --> 00:22:51.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And for Prue to say
she's then gonna use a yolk technique...

524
00:22:51.685 --> 00:22:53.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:58.565 --> 00:23:00.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:01.525 --> 00:23:02.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, it's a good start.

529
00:23:02.965 --> 00:23:05.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's my whole school life.
Could have done better really.

00:23:05.605 --> 00:23:07.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

were meant to be dry?

Hello, lovely bakers,

536
00:23:26.565 --> 00:23:29.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's time for your first

537
00:23:29.205 --> 00:23:32.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which today has been set for you
by the lovely Paul.

538
00:23:32.645 --> 00:23:35.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This was a real favourite of mine
when I was a kid.

539
00:23:35.125 --> 00:23:36.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please don't mess it up.

540
00:23:37.045 --> 00:23:39.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:39.885 --> 00:23:41.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so Paul and Prue are not
going to be lingering in the tent.

542
00:23:41.965 --> 00:23:44.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, off you two go. Thank you very much.

543
00:23:44.605 --> 00:23:45.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

544
00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:47.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bouncy castle.

545
00:23:47.205 --> 00:23:48.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah that's nice.

00:23:49.125 --> 00:23:50.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[all laughing]

547
00:23:50.765 --> 00:23:55.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul would like you to make his version
of the iconic Wagon Wheel.

548
00:23:55.445 --> 00:23:58.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] You have to make eight
and you have two and a quarter hours,

549
00:23:58.965 --> 00:24:00.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so you have to get your wagons rolling.

550
00:24:00.805 --> 00:24:01.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:06.365 --> 00:24:08.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Karen] Ooph! Well, that was unexpected.

553
00:24:10.085 --> 00:24:11.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:17.485 --> 00:24:21.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do know what a Wagon Wheel is. Hurrah.
Have I made one before? No. [laughs]

557
00:24:21.845 --> 00:24:23.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have absolutely no clue what these are.

560
00:24:30.685 --> 00:24:34.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never made a Wagon Wheel in my life.
But, yeah, I love 'em, so let's go for it.

561
00:24:36.645 --> 00:24:40.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, Paul,
this is the first Technical challenge.

562
00:24:40.365 --> 00:24:41.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why have we got Wagon Wheels?

563
00:24:42.045 --> 00:24:44.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think there's mainly different elements
to a Wagon Wheel.

564
00:24:44.365 --> 00:24:45.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite tricky.

565
00:24:45.405 --> 00:24:47.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got that biscuit which is crunchy,

566
00:24:47.285 --> 00:24:48.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's about getting the marshmallow right.

567
00:24:48.725 --> 00:24:49.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not something that's rubbery,

568
00:24:50.005 --> 00:24:51.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
not something that pours out

569
00:24:51.525 --> 00:24:54.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then the chocolate coating must be
nice and even over the top.

570
00:24:54.365 --> 00:24:57.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The chocolate should be firm enough
to hold that marshmallow.

571
00:24:57.405 --> 00:24:58.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's really beautiful.

572
00:24:58.485 --> 00:25:01.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The difficulty is putting
all that together without panicking.

573
00:25:01.925 --> 00:25:02.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got to test 'em.

574
00:25:04.525 --> 00:25:07.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For the biscuits, tip the flour,
salt and butter into a bowl.

575
00:25:07.445 --> 00:25:09.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Takes me back to my teacher days
where I'm like,

576
00:25:09.485 --> 00:25:12.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
read the question, underline
what they're looking for. [laughs]

577
00:25:12.485 --> 00:25:16.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did okay at exams.
So, cool as a cucumber.

578
00:25:16.725 --> 00:25:17.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rub the butter into the flour...

579
00:25:18.325 --> 00:25:22.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I made a few mistakes this morning
so I'm hoping to not do that again,

580
00:25:22.325 --> 00:25:23.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
especially in the Technical as well.

581
00:25:23.845 --> 00:25:25.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The first Technicals always
gonna be a tricky one.

582
00:25:25.525 --> 00:25:27.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Stir the sugar, vanilla paste,
add the egg yolk...

583
00:25:27.965 --> 00:25:30.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did something wrong already.

584
00:25:30.645 --> 00:25:34.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't rub the butter into the flour.
But we just got to go on with it.

585
00:25:34.765 --> 00:25:35.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Have you made these before?

586
00:25:36.045 --> 00:25:37.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've eaten lots of them before,
never made them.

587
00:25:37.805 --> 00:25:39.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a few people here
who've never even heard of them,

588
00:25:39.845 --> 00:25:41.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so you're ahead of the game.
I've never had one.

589
00:25:41.565 --> 00:25:42.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Really?
-No.

590
00:25:42.485 --> 00:25:43.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've never had a Wagon Wheel?
-No, darling.

591
00:25:44.045 --> 00:25:46.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What? Have you even lived?
No Wagon Wheels?

592
00:25:46.525 --> 00:25:51.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh, I, I'll be honest with you.
I was 55 before I tried a Pot Noodle.

593
00:25:52.405 --> 00:25:54.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well... Well, what can you...
-Yeah. It's possible

594
00:25:54.925 --> 00:25:57.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You can't come back from that.
-I missed out. I've missed out.

595
00:25:57.085 --> 00:26:00.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, so what do I do now?
Bring the dough together.

596
00:26:00.365 --> 00:26:01.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Luke] It's important not to,
sort of, knead it.

597
00:26:01.885 --> 00:26:04.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll lose that shortness in it.
Not mess with it too much.

598
00:26:05.245 --> 00:26:07.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just need to get the jam on now.

599
00:26:07.245 --> 00:26:08.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Raspberries. In you go.

600
00:26:09.445 --> 00:26:11.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Add the sugar and bring to the boil.

601
00:26:11.085 --> 00:26:13.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The jam you want it,
you want to get some heat in there.

602
00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:16.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at that jam. Cooking away,
bubbling up to thicken a little bit.

603
00:26:16.285 --> 00:26:20.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not looking how I would like it
to look. It seems a little watery.

604
00:26:20.285 --> 00:26:21.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, what's next?

605
00:26:21.405 --> 00:26:23.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bit that scares me about this
is the marshmallow.

606
00:26:23.365 --> 00:26:26.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tip the sugar into a medium pan,
add the glucose, the water...

607
00:26:26.445 --> 00:26:28.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] I've never made
marshmallow before.

608
00:26:28.405 --> 00:26:30.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still, I'm hoping that... Yeah, we'll see.

609
00:26:30.885 --> 00:26:33.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at me? It's gonna be great.

610
00:26:33.405 --> 00:26:35.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See look at that. Huh? Is that working?

611
00:26:35.765 --> 00:26:37.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, no.

612
00:26:37.885 --> 00:26:40.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As soon as the sugar syrup
reaches 120 degrees, remove from the heat.

613
00:26:41.245 --> 00:26:42.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A little off there yet.

614
00:26:43.805 --> 00:26:47.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need it to cook but it isn't.
My sugar isn't cooking.

615
00:26:49.085 --> 00:26:50.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Karen] So, there we are you see.
It's starting to get syrupy

616
00:26:51.005 --> 00:26:53.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just following the recipe
and it's going okay.

617
00:26:55.325 --> 00:26:56.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Antony] You've got to be kidding me.

618
00:26:57.045 --> 00:27:00.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did something stupidly wrong, yeah.

00:27:07.445 --> 00:27:10.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

turns into fluffy marshmallow.

Well, they were much larger in my day
and then they got smaller.

629
00:27:30.565 --> 00:27:31.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

639
00:27:50.525 --> 00:27:52.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

640
00:27:52.445 --> 00:27:53.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

641
00:27:55.165 --> 00:27:56.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

642
00:27:56.765 --> 00:27:58.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see them gently cooking. [chuckles]

643
00:27:58.925 --> 00:28:02.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's going in. I'm falling behind now,
I need to run, run, run, run, run.

644
00:28:02.805 --> 00:28:04.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, I think I'm gonna take them out.

645
00:28:04.565 --> 00:28:05.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

646
00:28:06.005 --> 00:28:06.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're looking tanned.

647
00:28:07.045 --> 00:28:08.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are cooked and they're circular.

648
00:28:08.645 --> 00:28:09.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Imelda] Just gonna need them
to chill a bit

649
00:28:10.045 --> 00:28:11.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
before I put the chocolate on them.
'Cause otherwise

650
00:28:12.005 --> 00:28:13.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the chocolate will just slide off.

00:28:16.805 --> 00:28:17.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Why you doing that?

654
00:28:17.725 --> 00:28:19.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just trying to like
cool the chocolate a little.

655
00:28:19.365 --> 00:28:22.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's because you're French, isn't it?
You like to sort of...

656
00:28:22.365 --> 00:28:23.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, no.

657
00:28:23.525 --> 00:28:25.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the French way of stirring.
The English people are all doing this.

658
00:28:27.565 --> 00:28:29.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To assemble,
spread some of the melted chocolate

659
00:28:29.725 --> 00:28:31.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

660
00:28:31.245 --> 00:28:34.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

661
00:28:35.085 --> 00:28:38.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Trying to get a nice smooth finish on it.
My hands are starting to shake.

662
00:28:39.045 --> 00:28:40.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, just get those in the freezer.

663
00:28:41.085 --> 00:28:44.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have
30 biscuit baking minutes left.

664
00:28:44.245 --> 00:28:45.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, come on.

665
00:28:46.205 --> 00:28:48.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pipe the marshmallow
over the remaining eight biscuits.

666
00:28:49.365 --> 00:28:51.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ruby] Try not to pipe
too close to the edge

667
00:28:51.325 --> 00:28:54.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I know when they sandwich
I don't want, like, serious spillage.

668
00:28:54.645 --> 00:28:57.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh dear. Marshmallow's overset.

669
00:28:57.325 --> 00:28:59.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My piping bag's split
because it's so thick.

670
00:28:59.685 --> 00:29:01.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

a Wagon Wheel, so I can't remember

672
00:29:04.765 --> 00:29:05.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:05.765 --> 00:29:07.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

674
00:29:08.325 --> 00:29:10.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

678
00:29:16.165 --> 00:29:17.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

679
00:29:17.205 --> 00:29:18.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

how to do full coverage.

680
00:29:19.045 --> 00:29:21.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:21.125 --> 00:29:22.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

682
00:29:22.805 --> 00:29:24.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dear, dear, dear. It's gonna be shabby.

683
00:29:24.965 --> 00:29:26.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] I'm gonna go for a full coverage.

684
00:29:26.525 --> 00:29:30.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cannot get the chocolate to come around
the side. So annoying.

685
00:29:30.085 --> 00:29:31.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

all the way through.

want to flood that gap.

00:29:34.645 --> 00:29:35.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

690
00:29:41.445 --> 00:29:43.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Put them in the freezer
I think just to chill quickly.

691
00:29:43.605 --> 00:29:45.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:30:46.365 --> 00:30:49.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a bit too much marshmallow. [laughs]

00:31:26.365 --> 00:31:28.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's what happens
if you don't cover the chocolate.

00:42:10.245 --> 00:42:12.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

It's so time-consuming
'cause there's so much biscuit to ice.

00:44:40.005 --> 00:44:41.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yep. No. It's delicious.

00:44:43.685 --> 00:44:45.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm doing it like a painting basically.

00:44:46.965 --> 00:44:48.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1042
00:44:49.165 --> 00:44:50.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1043
00:44:50.445 --> 00:44:52.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1048
00:45:03.845 --> 00:45:06.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the next thing to do
is get me on the board.

1049
00:45:06.405 --> 00:45:07.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

You look a bit like Bjork in that picture.

00:45:22.925 --> 00:45:25.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's alright.
You do have a bit of a Bjorkness to you,

1057
00:45:26.325 --> 00:45:28.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, someone told me I look like

00:45:33.525 --> 00:45:36.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:48:05.725 --> 00:48:07.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:50:04.485 --> 00:50:06.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:50:08.645 --> 00:50:10.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1150
00:50:10.965 --> 00:50:12.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1153
00:50:20.245 --> 00:50:21.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I suppose you could say, yeah, it is.

1154
00:50:22.125 --> 00:50:23.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

The biscuit's a little bland,

1158
00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:36.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
quite thick

00:50:37.205 --> 00:50:38.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a little dry.

1160
00:50:38.565 --> 00:50:41.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit like a stale shortbread.

Definitely not getting the ginger.

1163
00:50:45.765 --> 00:50:47.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:50:59.965 --> 00:51:01.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can see what you were trying to do.

1166
00:51:01.445 --> 00:51:03.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:51:06.285 --> 00:51:09.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And this is supposed to be a selfie
and it's supposed to be recognisable

1170
00:51:09.085 --> 00:51:10.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I don't think it quite is.

1171
00:51:10.845 --> 00:51:13.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay, let's try this biscuit now.

1172
00:51:13.445 --> 00:51:14.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Its cinnamon and ginger.
-Yeah.

1173
00:51:18.645 --> 00:51:20.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a strange taste of ginger.

1174
00:51:21.205 --> 00:51:22.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You, you do get the cinnamon

1175
00:51:22.765 --> 00:51:25.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's almost like they are fighting
each other for supremacy.

1176
00:51:25.645 --> 00:51:27.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Right.
-The biscuit's a bit soft.

1177
00:51:29.325 --> 00:51:30.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A little bit dry.

1178
00:51:32.445 --> 00:51:34.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It's not the best ginger biscuit
-Oh, you guys.

1179
00:51:34.165 --> 00:51:35.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've ever eaten.

1180
00:51:35.285 --> 00:51:36.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a shame you didn't finish it.

1181
00:51:36.805 --> 00:51:38.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Brutal.

1182
00:51:41.085 --> 00:51:42.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1183
00:51:46.965 --> 00:51:50.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Love the colours on it
and your portrait really works as well.

1184
00:51:50.925 --> 00:51:52.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the balloons, can we eat a balloon?

1185
00:51:52.685 --> 00:51:53.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, please do.

1186
00:51:56.925 --> 00:51:58.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Nice thin icing. I like that.

1187
00:52:01.725 --> 00:52:03.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would like to have
had more flavour in there.

1188
00:52:03.205 --> 00:52:04.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1189
00:52:04.285 --> 00:52:06.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a nice biscuit,
just needed more of a punch.

00:52:06.565 --> 00:52:07.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1191
00:52:07.925 --> 00:52:08.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's good.

1192
00:52:16.325 --> 00:52:17.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Excellent.

1193
00:52:17.445 --> 00:52:18.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1194
00:52:18.405 --> 00:52:21.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So detailed and so neat.
It's just exquisite.

1195
00:52:26.325 --> 00:52:28.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was nervous that the matcha

1196
00:52:29.045 --> 00:52:30.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
would be overpowering

1197
00:52:31.445 --> 00:52:33.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it's not at all, it's just a hint.

1198
00:52:34.725 --> 00:52:35.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

1199
00:52:36.245 --> 00:52:38.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The biscuit is delicious
but the balance of flavours and textures,

1200
00:52:38.845 --> 00:52:40.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've done,
I think you've done an amazing job.

00:52:49.645 --> 00:52:51.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Terry, please bring up
your biscuit selfie.

00:53:03.285 --> 00:53:04.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Prue] I think your face is brilliant.

1206
00:53:09.925 --> 00:53:13.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got chocolate, brandy snap,
buttercream and jam.

1207
00:53:13.445 --> 00:53:14.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's absolutely delicious.

1208
00:53:15.165 --> 00:53:16.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:53:16.405 --> 00:53:18.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's quite tricky to work
with brandy snap in that sort of size

1210
00:53:19.045 --> 00:53:21.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but to manage to get that
3D mould of your face,

1211
00:53:21.525 --> 00:53:23.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then the colour in there as well,

1212
00:53:23.365 --> 00:53:24.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the whole thing is very clever.

00:53:24.845 --> 00:53:26.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Manon. The style of her baking,
it's very classically French in many ways.

1237
00:54:33.085 --> 00:54:34.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:42.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And who's struggling?

Coming into today, Terry was in trouble.

1244
00:54:45.405 --> 00:54:47.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then he, sort of,
pulled a rabbit out of a hat, didn't he?

1245
00:54:48.005 --> 00:54:50.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pulled it off. That brandy snap
was like an impressionist painting.

1246
00:54:50.685 --> 00:54:53.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Has he done enough to save himself
over the three challenges,

1247
00:54:53.445 --> 00:54:54.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
not just the one?

1248
00:54:55.005 --> 00:54:56.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Imelda, she struggled in the Technical.

1249
00:54:56.885 --> 00:54:57.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Terrible Technical.

1250
00:54:57.805 --> 00:55:00.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think today
the biscuit wasn't good.

1251
00:55:00.205 --> 00:55:02.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think she had a lot to prove,
I think the pressure got to her.

1252
00:55:02.565 --> 00:55:04.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Ruby, first in the Technical

1253
00:55:05.005 --> 00:55:06.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but her other two were really not good.

1254
00:55:06.725 --> 00:55:08.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This one she didn't finish.

1255
00:55:08.245 --> 00:55:09.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] I think what's astonishing

1256
00:55:09.885 --> 00:55:11.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is we've just met these twelve

1257
00:55:11.565 --> 00:55:14.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I would already be sorry
to lose any of them.

1258
00:55:14.085 --> 00:55:14.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I know.
-No, agreed.

1259
00:55:28.165 --> 00:55:31.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, I have the pleasure of announcing
the first Star Baker.

1260
00:55:31.805 --> 00:55:35.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Star Baker who had
a wonderfully nutty first round

1261
00:55:35.685 --> 00:55:39.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and whose attention to detail
was unbelievable.

1262
00:55:39.685 --> 00:55:43.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The Star Baker is Manon.

1263
00:55:44.885 --> 00:55:45.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1264
00:55:49.485 --> 00:55:53.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So that means it falls to me
to deliver the sad news.

1265
00:55:56.525 --> 00:55:58.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The person going home is...

1266
00:56:05.045 --> 00:56:05.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Imelda.

1267
00:56:06.405 --> 00:56:07.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all] Aw.

1268
00:56:07.565 --> 00:56:08.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] I'm so sorry.

1269
00:56:13.965 --> 00:56:14.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great job.

1270
00:56:15.645 --> 00:56:16.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh God.

1271
00:56:17.045 --> 00:56:18.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, okay.

1272
00:56:18.285 --> 00:56:19.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-You all right?

1273
00:56:20.085 --> 00:56:21.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am sorry.

1274
00:56:21.205 --> 00:56:23.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That must have been like the tightest call
ever. I'm so sorry.

1275
00:56:24.845 --> 00:56:27.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Frustrated, because I know
I can do better.

1276
00:56:27.205 --> 00:56:29.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But at the same time,</i>
<i>one of the best experiences of my life.</i>

1277
00:56:36.565 --> 00:56:38.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry, Prue, I can do
so much better than that.

1278
00:56:39.445 --> 00:56:42.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel really bad
because part of me feels like

1279
00:56:42.165 --> 00:56:43.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it probably should have been me.

1280
00:56:43.645 --> 00:56:45.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1281
00:56:45.285 --> 00:56:47.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I'm like completely relieved.

1283
00:56:49.645 --> 00:56:50.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1284
00:56:50.765 --> 00:56:53.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kick up the backside I guess,
and so I've got to pull my socks up.

1285
00:56:53.805 --> 00:56:56.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
