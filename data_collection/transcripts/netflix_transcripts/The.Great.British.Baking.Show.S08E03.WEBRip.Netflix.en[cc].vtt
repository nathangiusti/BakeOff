Butter, would you believe,
is the easiest thing to make in the world.

303
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a thick double cream,

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

310
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Mark] Added some more Irish stout
into the butter

311
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

It's spread a bit more than

334
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's traditional, that shape,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

It's certainly cooked.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It could be darker in colour,

340
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] I think I'm gonna take that out.
I'm going with it.

341
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

342
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This one, it's very dense
with the marzipan.

343
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

344
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is that not a sign
that you shouldn't use marzipan?

345
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

and olive is one of those.

[Lottie] And my sweet
is blueberry and maple bacon.

404
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, the blueberries
are not exactly evenly spread, are they?

405
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I get a blueberry, it's delicious,
the texture's good.

406
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm missing the bacon.

407
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's wasted on the outside.

408
00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lot of it's gonna end up on the plate
and you won't taste it.

409
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] They look great.

412
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very brave to take
the gluten-free option.

413
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Difficult though, isn't it?

414
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's falling to bits a bit

415
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Okay.

417
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the honey, texture's beautiful.

418
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very cake-like, though, isn't it?

419
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a little bit stodgy.

420
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavours are delicious.

421
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your flavours are normally spot-on.

422
00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Very rustic.
-[Prue] They look classic.

423
00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're really good.
-[Paul] Hmm.

424
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love that.

425
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Mmm. It's a nice loaf.

426
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you get a mouthful of everything,
it's delicious.

427
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much.

428
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Okay.
-[Prue] This is a little doughier.

429
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] More cake-like.
-Nice flavour, though.

430
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's cranberries, is it?
-Cranberries, chocolates, and sea salt.

431
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not getting the cranberry.

432
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just a little bit weak.

433
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Needs a bit more.

434
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thank you.

435
00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They both look as if
they haven't risen enough.

436
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-There are very big lumps of sausage.
-Yes.

[Rowan laughs]

438
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You always like a lot of sausage?
-Wouldn't care to comment.

439
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay, fair enough.
-[chuckles]

440
00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, the sausage is okay,
the olives are okay.

441
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I would have left the bread in longer.
-Right.

442
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] See how wet--
-[Prue] That's why it's so heavy.

443
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It'd be nice if it was lighter.

444
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Wow.

445
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That much polenta in there was a mistake.

446
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's too gritty for me.

447
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit like eating
a lemon drizzle cake in a sandstorm.

448
00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

449
00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Looks as if it's risen nicely.

450
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not enough flavour for me.
-[Dave] No?

451
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You put Gruyère?
-[Dave] Yes.

452
00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You need double that, triple that.
-Yeah. Okay.

453
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You do get the chocolate,
just not enough in each bite.

454
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a shame,
'cause it's baked well, actually.

455
00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Two very good loaves.

456
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You just need a bit more flavour.

457
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Let's try the za'atar one first.

458
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] What oven temperature did you use?
-160.

459
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That's why it's so pale.

460
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The blend of olives
and za'atar is delicious.

461
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I like the flavour.
Right, sweet one.

462
00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are the fruits mostly apricots?

463
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sura] Apricots,
dried cherries, and walnut.

464
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think that is delicious.
-Thank you.

465
00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really, really good.

466
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My only issue of both loaves
is your temperature choice.

467
00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should've baked them higher
and it would've been spot-on.

468
00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

469
00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Looks good, but I hope
it's baked all the way through.

470
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I get worried when they're that pale.

471
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Needed a little longer in the oven.

472
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's such a pity
because the flavour is lovely.

473
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a bit soggy, too.

474
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Does have that spicy
bara brith flavour to it.

475
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you try and push
a load of fruit into a loaf,

476
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if you shape it too tight,
all the fruit goes to the outside.

477
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's nothing inside.

478
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the flavour,
but unfortunately, all the fruit burnt

479
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-on the top of the loaf, not in it.
-Yeah.

480
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] They look really nice.

481
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The idea of putting
the smoked salmon in it is so original.

482
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never had that.

483
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You invented a bread.
-[whispering] Yeah!

484
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That, I really like.
The salmon really works.

485
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like a whole sandwich all in one.

486
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The aftertaste is lovely.

487
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's nice and well-baked.
-Thank you.

488
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's a very grown-up fruit cake.
-[Prue] Mmm.

489
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lots of booze. Lovely.

490
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've soaked the fruit
for a couple of weeks.

491
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You serious?

492
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] She wanted us to taste it.
-[Paul] Wow.

493
00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Lovely.
-Thank you.

494
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think they're very special. I really do.

495
00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[all exclaiming and clapping]
-[Hermine] Oh!

496
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

497
00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Know what I love?
The fact that I've never had them before.

498
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-This has really complex flavours.

499
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love it. It's special.

500
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

501
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's it, I'm packing.

502
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Time to go home.

503
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's 2020, over.

504
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That went better than I expected.
I was terrified, honestly.

505
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the flavour queen is back.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The comments were not entirely positive,

507
00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I'm very determined learning
from the last technical

508
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to spend a bit of time thinking
and not just dashing straight into it.

[Noel] <i>Bread Week</i>
<i>isn't about to get any easier.</i>

510
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Our ten bakers will now face</i>
<i>a technical with a twist.</i>

511
00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, it's time for
your technical challenge,

512
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which today has been set by Paul.

513
00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, any words of advice?

514
00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You need…

515
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to get your timings right.

516
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, he said words of advice,
not just words.

517
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your technical challenge
will be judged blind,

518
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so we're gonna have to ask
these two rascals to skedaddle.

519
00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Off you pop.

520
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, Paul would like you to bake
six rainbow-coloured bagels.

521
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Rainbow-coloured bagels
are the same as normal bagels,

522
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
just with five different coloured doughs.

523
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Layered, shaped, then boiled and baked
to achieve a lovely, shiny, chewy crust.

524
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chewy crust.

525
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have two hours and 45 minutes.

526
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks.
-[Noel] Get set.

527
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake.

528
00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dave] Oh, my God.

529
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What the hell is a rainbow bagel?
I mean…

530
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No idea. [chuckles]

531
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Never made them before,
certainly not the rainbow one,

532
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so… interesting.

533
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've made bagels before,
but I don't wanna say,

534
00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"I've made bagels before",
and then they come out awful.

535
00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Linda] Kind of makes sense
when you read it through.

536
00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just go with it. [laughs]

537
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a bagel shop near work,
so I've seen how they make it,

538
00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I've never made it myself.

539
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wouldn't have to, it's right there.

540
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul.

541
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, why rainbow-coloured bagels?

542
00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Bagels are a great challenge
when you're making bread.

543
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gotta boil them, which is unusual,
and then bake them.

544
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The rainbow colours for me,

545
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
although it originated over in the States,
I think it represents the NHS.

546
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It does now.

547
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Certainly.
-[Prue chuckles]

548
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] What they've gotta do is

549
00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
roll each piece, each colour,
into a rectangle.

550
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lay the next one on the top and continue.

551
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stack them.
-Yes.

552
00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And twist it to create that spiral
and then you seal.

553
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You plunge it in the water
for anything between 15 and 40 seconds

554
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then bake it off.

555
00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can we taste them?

556
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Absolutely.

557
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] What could go wrong?

558
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You can easily overprove
and underprove a bagel.

559
00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's overproved
before it's gone in the water

560
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or if it's left in the water too long,
it will flatten in the oven.

561
00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely delicious.

562
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's even brighter inside
than it is outside.

563
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Pretty vibrant.

564
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They may have made bagels before,
but I guarantee not like this.

565
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never made them like this.

566
00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Happy bread.

567
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Happy bread". That's what it is.

568
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lottie] "Make and knead the dough."

569
00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's, erm, scant, isn't it, at best?

570
00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Normally, I would
chuck it in a stand mixer.

571
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're definitely getting
a full workout today.

572
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're in 2020,
who kneads by hand? [exclaims]

573
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Peter] I know it needs to be kneaded
a good amount for a bagel,

574
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'm gonna be working this
until it's super smooth.

575
00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Think it's gonna be
quite a stretchy, elastic dough.

576
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It still feels a little tight.

577
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] Stretch and tear,
that's the way to go.

578
00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rowan's doing the slap already.

579
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whack it.

580
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very therapeutic, it really is.

581
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckling] So disappointed that there
aren't any rainbows in a rainbow bagel.

582
00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Real rainbows?

583
00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wanted you to have to go
and catch a rainbow.

584
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Lasso it.

585
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Chop it up, grate it into the bagel…
-[chuckles]

586
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
…but no, it's just some coloured bread.

587
00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rowan] I think that must be about it now.

588
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it says to divide the dough
into five pieces.

589
00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll colour them each a different colour.

590
00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rowan] Never done coloured bread.

591
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's all part
of the voyage of discovery.

592
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A very messy business.

593
00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Marc] They wanna be nice and vibrant.

594
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really hard to mix in all the colours.

595
00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lottie] I might have used too much,

596
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
just judging by the fact that no one
else's bench is the same colour as mine.

597
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're a Smurf, aren't you?
-Yes. [chuckles]

598
00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lottie] That'll do. I'm over that.

599
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Number four, rise."
Exceptionally descriptive.

600
00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Arise, Sir Dough.

601
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna leave it
to prove till it's doubled in size.

602
00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's only small pieces.

603
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna go
about 20 minutes to start with.

604
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And breathe. [chuckling]

605
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] I would normally snooze,
or play the piano, actually,

606
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
while the dough is rising.
Perhaps do a spot of gardening.

607
00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could nip outside
and do a bit of pruning.

608
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Marc] If you prod,

609
00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
leaves a slight indent,
then they're ready to go.

610
00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're doing all that,
so it's time to go with them.

611
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gonna start rolling them out
in colour order, so red first.

612
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this from the handshake?

613
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

614
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what happens… with Paul.

615
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's his fake tan.

616
00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They can take handshakes back.

617
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah?

618
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They'll just reverse the footage.

619

620
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like… [mimics rewinding]

621
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Roll out to a rectangle,
measuring 15 by 20 centimetres."

622
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna check what
15 centimetres looks like, just so I know.

623
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you comparing against?

624
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just half the ruler, Dave.

625
00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

626
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Linda] You're just layering the doughs.

627
00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just trying
to get some kind of evenness.

628
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] Like making
brightly coloured mattresses.

629
00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're very bouncy and very illuminous.

630
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So now I'm cutting the dough into six.

631

"Roll and twist the dough to a rope,

633
00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are approximately 24.

634
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am, aren't I?
We've got to 24 centimetres.

635
00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-How many inches? I think in inches.

636
00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, that's nine and a half inches.

637
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Think that's respectable, myself.

638
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Marc] Kind of pull back on this palm,

639
00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and go forward on this palm.

640
00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Hermine giggles] Oh, dear.

641
00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a rainbow, isn't it?

642
00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There you go. [chuckles]

643
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dave] Just gotta
try and seal this bit now.

644
00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lottie] "Gently roll back and forth".

645
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't get it.
-I don't want it to fall apart.

646
00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Laura in singsong voice]
Haven't got a clue.

647
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Linda] It's not too bad.
Once you get the knack of it,

648
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's like… Whoo!

649
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

650
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lottie] Everyone's twisted theirs,
I didn't twist mine.

651
00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that's right,
'cause they're gonna expand,

652
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the hole's gonna shrink.

653
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By the time it's expanded
and shrunk, it should be about right.

654
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It does say twist.
-[Dave] Does it?

655
00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. It says "roll and twist".

656
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you are halfway through.

657
00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Marc] And number ten is prove.

658
00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just the one word in that step.

659
00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not very elaborate, is he?

660
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Mark] Wanna give them
as much time as possible.

661
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the trick
with these is in the timing.

662
00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The second prove
is gonna be the one for texture.

663
00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Try that again, shall we?

664
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll put the drawer up a bit warmer.
See if we can get a quick prove on the go.

665
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll see how we get on. [chuckles]

666

[Marc] It's driven me to drink green tea.

668
00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[laughing] Yeah.

I'd drink through it.

678
00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're looking good!

679
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They don't look bad, actually.

680
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Marc] Reckon, about ready.
Right, glasses off.

681

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, let's have a look.

687
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel a bit nervous,
'cause I don't think they cook long.

688

689
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think this is what gives
the bagels that chewy kind of texture.

690
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yes.

695
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

696
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not any more than that.

697
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They go in looking good,
and then… things happen.

698
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

701
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Especially when
you never made them before.

702
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why don't you see

703
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have been, but theirs
aren't looking terribly good, either.

706
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So hard to know.
Let's have them in a bit longer.

707
00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ooh! Paul Hollywood is definitely
taking his handshake back. [chuckles]

708
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'Cause these… [groans]

709
00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's them all boiled now.

710
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even though they've doubled in size,

711
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they seem to have
lost it when I boiled them.

712
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Linda] I got it.

713
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This one opened up, but don't tell Paul.

714
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've stuck it back together,

715
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and hopefully it'll just

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

they're ready? 'Cause normally,

726
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

727
00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Overproved before they went in the water,

Just slightly overbaked.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

with the water, overproved.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

800
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look more like pretzels.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

803
00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

805
00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lost its way a little in the shaping,
but also with the water, as well.

806
00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Again, see the marks.
-[Prue] Hmm.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

846
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, for Star Baker,
she struggled a bit in the technical.

848
00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

there are a couple of others.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it's a tricky showstopper today,

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I'd like to see
all the bakers complete the task,

863
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

It's time for your showstopper challenge.

Today, the judges would like you to make
a large decorative bread plaque

869
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in the style of a traditional
harvest festival sheaf.

871
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
your bread plaque must portray
the one thing you are most grateful for.

872
00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Your bread must be
impressive in size, visually powerful,

873
00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and, of course,
it's got to be delish-delosh.

874
00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have three hours and 30 minutes.

875
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't seem long enough.

876
00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know. They've been done up
like a kipper.

877
00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

879
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Feeling nervous today. It's a big one.

880
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] Traditionally,
the harvest plaque is inedible

881
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and rock hard and varnished.
So, to make it utterly delicious…

882
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[softly] …it's quite a challenge.

883
00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Bricking it.

884
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bread plaque itself
must be a celebration

885
00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of something that the bakers
are thankful for.

886
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It could be your house,
it could be their health, anything.

887
00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's really easy to sit there
and design something elaborate on paper.

888
00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not anything like easy
to make it in bread.

889
00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's about manipulating dough itself,
using knife techniques,

890
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
plaiting, twisting, spiralling the bread.

891
00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a great challenge,
because it'll give me the indication

892
00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of how far these bakers have travelled
on their bread journey.

893
00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope they've practised it,

894
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because they'll never get it right
if they haven't.

I've got this Tibetan monastery bread.

I'm not a Buddhist, but after I had
the accident where I lost my leg,

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1123
00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it is a little bit tricky.

that's come around, yeah.

1130
00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks like a bit of a shambles
at the moment.

1131
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But a few well-placed details
can bring the whole thing to life.

1132
00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll give it a red egg wash
before going in the oven.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:49.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have a wheel.
It's starting to come together.

1152
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is my twist to go on the outside.

Oh, well, that's sad.

1154
00:51:56.120 --> 00:52:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

No one would ever know.

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so that it doesn't crack up too much.

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then I've got some beetroot powder
on the tomatoes.

in the right places.

1161
00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1162
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1165
00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1167
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna have
about four minutes to spare, I think.

1168
00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm having to rush these.
I'm really out of time now,

1169
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I need to get this in the oven.

1170

You have half an hour left.

1171

-All right, it's gone in.
-[Matt] That's 30 minutes.

1172
00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, crumbs! Right. I'm going in.

1173
00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's get on with some baking!

1174
00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckling] That was really close.

1175
00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs 30 minutes.
I've got exactly 30 minutes.

1176

[Hermine] My brioche, it hasn't proved
as well as I wanted.

1177
00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna give it a bit more time.

1178
00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Mark] It feels like
that's the challenge over, though.

1179
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's really weird.

1180
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have a little clean-up now.

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

just to take a mindful breath.

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to the present moment.

1185
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we're worrying about things in our past.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dave] I shouldn't have floured it,
to be honest.

1187
00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or they're worrying about the future.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And ultimately, we've got
no control over that, have we?

1190
00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course, it's easier said than done.

1191
00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and if he doesn't get it,
he's gonna be furious.

1194
00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1195
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:49.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Hermine] That should take
about 15 minutes, hopefully.

1196
00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks a bit abstract.

1225
00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] You're driving through vineyards?
-[Hermine] Yes.

1226
00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-These?
-That's supposed to be farmer's field

1227
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and a tractor.
-[Prue] A tractor.

1228
00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-[Paul] I see, okay.

1229
00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've lost a bit of definition
in the swirl on the outside,

1230
00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but overall, it looks good.

1231
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's have a look
at the frame to start with.

1232
00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the brioche.

1233
00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Hermine] Yes.

1234
00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And the main bit is the focaccia.
-Yeah.

1235
00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The brioche doesn't hold much flavour.

1236
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I knew you were gonna struggle
to get that out in time.

1237
00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's an enriched dough
but it's not a brioche.

1238
00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Focaccia's lovely.
-Thank you.

1239
00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's springy. I like both, actually.

1240
00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The focaccia is not bad.
But I do like the design.

1241
00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's very, very good.
-Thank you.

1242
00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I think it looks quite dramatic
and effective.

1243
00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The plait on the outside
is not bad.

1244
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I like the effect you've got
by interlacing the two.

1245
00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Texture looks good.

1246
00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that is beautifully seasoned.

1247
00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The tomato bread is nice.
It's got a nice zing.

1248
00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But more importantly, it's the structure,

1249
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the air bubbles, it's regular,
and it's even all the way down.

1250
00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a nice loaf.
-Thank you.

1251
00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you try one of the balls?

1252
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They've got feta inside.

1253
00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm.

1254
00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is delicious.

1255
00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can I go?
-Yes, absolutely.

1256
00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[all laughing]
-Your agony is over.

1257
00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Well done, Sura.
-Thank you.

1258
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I love your Victorian swags
of great velvet curtain.

1259
00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your gilded tassels are wonderful.

1260
00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's simple but effective.

1261
00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Shall we have a look?
-[Prue] Yeah.

1262
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Laura] It's a focaccia base
with pancetta and cheese.

1263
00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's got quite a punch.

1264
00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your ingredient choices are good.

1265
00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The problem is focaccia
is a very, very light dough

1266
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you put that
on top of it so it couldn't rise.

1267
00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what it did is
concertina back down again

1268
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and so it feels quite raw.

1269
00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's a pity, because when you get
the edge of the focaccia,

1270
00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's really nice bread.

1271
00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The chili bread's got a kick to it.

1272
00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not bad at all.

1273
00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's full of flavour.
but textures weren't right.

1274
00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's simple, sort of effective.

1275
00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you could've done more with it.

1276
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your flavours are coming from

1277
00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the seeds on the top of the dried herbs.
They carry through.

1278
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a nice eat.
-[Prue] It tastes very nice.

1279
00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just feel it's a little dense and tough.

1280
00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] You made a bagel like a pitta.

1281
00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a little weird.
-[laughs] It is, isn't it?

1282
00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A bread shouldn't do that.

1283
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like a piece of leather.

1284
00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Peter.

1285
00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:01.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The design's pretty good.

1286
00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You kept some definition in there, too.

1287
00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The bread is well risen,
it feels great,

1288
00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but it lacks flavour.
-Okay.

1289
00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And this is tomato and paprika.
-Yes.

1290
00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, tomato, paprika and chorizo.

1291
00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That packs a punch. That's nice.
-[Prue] Yes.

1292
00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Nice balance of flavour with it.

1293
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice bread. Should've done more with that…

1294
00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Very nice.
-…rather than the white.

1295
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I like the concept,
I like the design, I love the cow.

1296
00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We drunk milk straight from the cow
when we was children.

1297
00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-From the udders?
-Not quite.

1298
00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Wow.
-[Linda laughs]

1299
00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:42.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Remind me of the flavour again?

1300
00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's olive and tiger bread.

1301
00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not tiger bread topping.

1302
00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the flavours of it,
but not so much the cracking.

1303
00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay.

1304
00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It's dense.
-[Paul] Needs more olives.

1305
00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
More proving's needed.
More flavour's needed.

1306
00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Interesting trees.

1307
00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Little bit bulky
compared to the rest of it.

1308
00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I like the bee.

1309
00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The plaiting's a little bit
irregular, thick and then thin.

1310
00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The structure's not bad, because actually,
you do have a light crust.

1311
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is wetter on the mouth,
which is what you want.

1312
00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flavour's not that strong, though,

1313
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
considering you're using wild garlic,

1314
00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you should be getting
a serious kick from that.

1315
00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This one's got apple and cinnamon?

1316
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Mark] In the middle, yeah.

1317
00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm. The apple
and cinnamon is really nice.

1318
00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit basic, the picture,
but the bread is okay.

1319
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Well, it looks really surprising

1320
00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:43.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and pretty, and quite neat.
Certainly colourful.

1321
00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you dig deeper around the edges,

1322
00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's a bit weak on the plaiting.
It's slightly underproved,

1323
00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and ripped in the oven.
-Okay.

1324
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But this particular area here is gorgeous.

1325
00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Marc] Thank you.
-Really nice. Neat, clever.

1326
00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] It's intricate detail, isn't it?

1327
00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Oh, look.
That looks like nice bread.

1328
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The flavour of the brown's not bad.

1329
01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It could do with more salt.
-[Marc] Okay.

1330
01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Fennel one is nice.
Overall, I like those flavours.

1331
01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-I think you've done a really good job.

1332
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks good, tastes good,
smells good. It is good.

1333
01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Great.
-[Paul] Thank you.

1334
01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much.
-Well done.

1335
01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Marc] Thank you very much.

1336
01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Your wife's pregnant?

1337
01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. Although I do look
more pregnant than she does.

1338
01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] I was gonna say.

1339
01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's called sympathetic pregnancy.

1340
01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I would've spent time
cutting bricks out

1341
01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and placed them on
and just built up that brickwork look.

1342
01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You sort of get it,
but it would look nice with that.

1343
01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1344
01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] This is the one with--

1345
01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mango, lime and chili paste
running through.

1346
01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You certainly get
the mango and the chilli.

1347
01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I like the flavour.
Never had anything like that.

1348
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I think the bread's a little too dry.

1349
01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's overbaked.
-Okay.

1350
01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The flavour of the base?

1351
01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is hibiscus and guava flavour drops.

1352
01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never met guava flavour.

1353
01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never had an Um Bongo, Prue?

1354
01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Never been to the Congo?
-[Prue] I know guavas well,

1355
01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but I've never known it as an essence.
-Right.

1356
01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I can't really taste it.

1357
01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The ideas are unique.
Never tried either before.

1358
01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just that the baking was a little too far.

1359
01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Yeah. Fair enough.
-[Paul] Thank you.

1360
01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You need a hand, right?
-I do, please.

1361
01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Let's do this.

1362
01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that gonna fit?
-[Rowan] Let's hope.

1363
01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Well, Rowan. [chuckles]

1364
01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it looks great.
I think it looks quite attractive.

1365
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:32.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very big.

1366
01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] What's the bread?
-[Rowan] Worcestershire, blue cheese

1367
01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and pears soaked in local cider.

1368
01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Get the cider.

1369
01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where's the blue cheese?

1370
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, I pressed it in.
-You pressed it in?

1371
01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's why we don't get the taste.

1372
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Rowan] Right.
-I would've mixed it in the dough.

1373
01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you needed much more proving in that.

1374
01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keeping these restrained to keep the look.

1375
01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've gone for all style
and no substance.

1376
01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've ended up with a bread
which is quite bland.

1377
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Right.
-[Paul] What's the flavour of that one?

1378
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is chestnut and walnut.

1379
01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Again, walnuts, lot more.

1380
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's such a pity,
'cause that's much nicer bread.

1381
01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Should we try the earthy one?

1382
01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can smell the truffle.

1383
01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Definitely has more flavour,
but it could do with some salt.

1384
01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay. [chuckles]
-[Paul] Thank you very much.

1385
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rowan] Many thanks.

1386
01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All style, no substance, that's me.

1387
01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] I'd rather be all style,
no substance anyway.

1388
01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Somewhat disappointed.
I was very happy with the look of it

1389
01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and so, I'm glad to have
done what I could do.

1390
01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dave] Feeling a little uneasy.

1391
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I might be home tomorrow,
but, erm, I haven't phoned her yet.

1392
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It would mean a lot
to come back next week.

1393
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That went better than expected.

1394
01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hear these things from my parents,

1395
01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and think,
"It's 'cause you're my parents."

1396
01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's nice to hear it from them.

1397
01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm really happy with that.

1398
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It'd feel amazing, I think,

1399
01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if they called out that
I was Star Baker for the week.

1400
01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But, yeah, I don't know how I'd handle it.

1401
01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] How do you think that went?

1402
01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Overall, the standard wasn't good.

1403
01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think they feel a lot of pressure
on Bread Week to impress you

1404
01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and often, they implode.

1405
01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They needed to come in strong.

1406
01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:15.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you're not confident, it shows.

1407
01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Sura and Marc E,

1408
01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
those two worked with terrific confidence
and they're bang in your face.

1409
01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They both managed to get
the right texture, the right flavour,

1410
01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the right look.

1411
01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So, Star Baker, Marc E and Sura.
-Yeah.

1412
01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What about Hermine?
She had a handshake.

1413
01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hermine has got a possibility.
Technical wasn't brilliant.

1414
01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:36.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And her showstopper,
I didn't like the enriched dough.

1415
01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who do you think's at the bottom?

1416
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Obviously Rowan. Anyone else?
-[Paul] Peter's in trouble.

1417
01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I also think David's in trouble.

1418
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Our two previous Star Bakers.
-Yeah.

1419
01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] In defence of Rowan,

1420
01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
his showstopper really looked like
a showstopper, didn't it?

1421
01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Again, style and substance.
It lacked flavour.

1422
01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But how much flavour
do breads really need?

1423
01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've crossed the line.
-I've crossed the line.

1424
01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you wanna fight, Matt?

1425
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, bakers, congratulations.

1426
01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know it's been a long couple of days.

1427
01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One of you is Star Baker

1428
01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that person is…

1429
01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-Wow.

1431
01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, bakers, that means
I've got the horrible job

1432
01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of sending someone home.

1433
01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] The person who is leaving us is…

1434
01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rowan.

1435
01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's fine. [laughs]

1436
01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These boots were made for walking.

1437
01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

1438
01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel very content, really.

1439
01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've had a wonderful time.

1440
01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, it is exhausting, but very rewarding.

1441
01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bring it in. Bring it in, kids.

1442
01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Mark] Sorry, Rowan.

1443
01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I was also quite pleased
that Noel said to me,

1444
01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"I'm all style and no substance."

1445
01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He said, "It's on my CV." [laughs]

1446
01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Hermine] Gonna miss those laughs.

1447
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rowan] Oh!

1448
01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rowan's been such a character.
I'm sorry to see him go

1449
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because he is so ambitious
and so imaginative

1450
01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and he puts so much thought
into his baking.

1451
01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He delivered a showstopper

1452
01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which was very impressive to look at,

1453
01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it just didn't taste good.

1454
01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Laura] Gonna miss you, Rowan.

1455
01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Such mixed emotions.
Sad for Rowan, ecstatic for Marc

1456
01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause he really deserved
and needed that for his confidence.

1457
01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just got Star Baker, didn't I?

1458
01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On Bread Week.
It's the thing that I enjoy making.

1459
01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the thing that started me on
this whole baking experience.

1460
01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:51.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To get Star Baker is amazing.

1461
01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Well done.
-Thank you.

1462
01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was really good.

1463
01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Marc did really well in the signature.
Pretty well in the technical, too.

1464
01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And in the showstopper,

1465
01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he managed to get his dough risen
and tasting good.

1466
01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, the whole Buddhist ethos
really worked for him.

1467
01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey! [chuckles]

1468
01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done for being Star Baker.
-Thank you.

1469
01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Gibbygibs.

1470
01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, girls.

1471
01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Marc] I love you, too. You're the best.

1472
01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1473
01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you made me get emotional now.
