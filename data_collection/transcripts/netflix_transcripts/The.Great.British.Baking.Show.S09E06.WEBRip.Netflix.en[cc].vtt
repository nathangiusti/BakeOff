00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, I am excited

a new dance move here.

Filo pastry, never made it in my life.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Giuseppe] This is week six,
the second half of the journey.

26
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm performing much
better than I expected.

27
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In fact, I had to keep buying shirts,

28
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because I didn't bring enough with me.

29
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lizzie] I've managed
to worm me way through

30
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
cause there's been loads of people.
Now it's getting less, it's harder.

31
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I spoke to Lizzie:
"Come on, we cannot back down."

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Amanda might be able
to pull it out of the bag.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

No one's giving up in there.
I'm certainly not giving up.

Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.
It's Pastry Week.

37
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's time for your signature challenge.

38
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul and Prue would like you each to make

39
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
two batches of decorated chouxnuts.

40
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you know that Paul Hollywood
invented the chouxnut pouch.

41
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He had some spare leather
and nowhere to put his nuts.

42
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're thinking of the jockstrap.
-Oh, yeah.

43
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now your chouxnuts
need to be perfectly fried.

44
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] And either glazed or iced.

48
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, ah, ah, wait, Chigs.
Cause I haven't said it yet.

50
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not my time you're wasting.

51
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake!

52
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A chouxnut
is much lighter than a doughnut.

53
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's almost like a fried eclair.

54
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[George] I actually prefer
the chouxnuts to doughnuts.

55
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I like eating them.

56
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not a chouxnutter at all.

57
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, if I went to hell,
I feel like this is what my hell would be.

58
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you've never heard
of a chouxnut before.

59
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Basically, it's choux pastry

60
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
piped into a doughnut shape, deep fried.

61
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] We want two batches.

62
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One of them has to have filling inside,

63
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and one of them has to have a really
interesting icing or glaze.

64
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The chouxnuts
themselves are quite aerated.

65
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want that beautiful aeration
inside the chouxnuts.

66
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Choux has to be exactly
the right consistency.

67
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, getting the paste right
is most important.

68
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If it's too wet, it's going to sink.

69
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Morning, Lizzie.
-[Lizzie] Morning.

70
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-All right, Lizzie, chouxnuts.
-Ugh! The devil's doughnuts.

71
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They have me shook already.
I'm, like, shaken.

72
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What she's saying is
she's quite upset about it.

73
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

74
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, tell us about your flavours.

75
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I'm doing raspberry liqueur
and hibiscus for the filled one.

76
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

81

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I just feel like the fryer's gonna

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It's very light.
-It's so delicate, it's lovely. Okay.

309
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] These are
the unfilled ones.

310
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They have a yuzu and sake glaze.

311
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It has that little bit of acidity
which yuzu gives it.

312
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're both delicious.
-Thank you.

313
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The filled ones,
they are Paris-Brest inspired.

314
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got
praline cream in the middle.

315
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can't see the structure
'cause there's so much of the filling.

316
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think Paris-Brest
should have lots of filling.

317
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's delicious. Mm.

318
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] This is
my chocolate lime chouxnut.

319
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cocoa, that's just enough
to marry with the lime.

320
00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's unusual, but it does work.

321
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a nice chouxnut, that one.
-Thank you.

322
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's delicate.

323
00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
So, those are the empty chouxnuts
with almond praline.

324
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Good frying.
-[Prue] Colour's nice, isn't it?

325
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Contrast of the praline crunch
and the softness of the choux

326
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is just lovely.

327
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Okay. Let's have
a look at your filled one.

328
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crème pat and limoncello.

329
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's definitely crème pat
with limoncello.

330
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is too much limoncello,
and I can't resist another mouthful.

331
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ah-hah.
-[Paul] Mm.

332
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] This is the miso caramel…
-[Crystelle] And white chocolate.

333
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It is exactly how you said,
it's umami.

334
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got a… You know,
it has got that bitterness to it.

335
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the tropical passionfruit choux,
it's just beautiful.

336
00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But the choux itself is very tight.
-Yeah.

337
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not open enough.
It should be… [blows air]

338
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've lost a lot of the definition.

339
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you think you lost
some of the definition in the frying?

340
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

341
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You need to give it a bit of a hit.
-Yeah.

342
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The choux's let you down a little bit.
-Okay. Thank you.

343
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay. The maple bacon.

344
00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It needs the bacon.

345
00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Could have done with a tiny bit more.
-Yeah, that's a shame.

346
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Because I had so much left over.
-[Prue] Yeah.

347
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Let's have
a look at your filled one.

348
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amanda] It's pistachio crème pat
with a rose glaze.

349
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The, uh, rose,

350
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's like, um, artificial cordial.

351
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Too rosy and too sweet.
-Okay.

352
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

353
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite attractive.

354
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The frying colour looks good.

355
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm.

356
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hibiscus and what?
-Raspberry liqueur.

357
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The hibiscus flavour's quite nice,
and so's the raspberry.

358
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overall, it's got a nice structure to it.
It's delicate.

359
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the toffee,
it's delicious as well.

360
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would buy these in a shop,
that's for sure.

361
00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. I've been in panic.

362
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're ruining my lifetime's theory
that you cannot cook if you don't love it.

363
00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Well done.
-[Prue] Anyway, well done.

364
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Ta. Ta.

365
00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispers] Feel so sick.

366
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles] Well, it's tough.
Well done.

367
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lizzie] That was me best
signature feedback.

368
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought I was gonna, like, pass out
when they were speaking to me.

369
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just couldn't believe
what they were saying.

370
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Amanda] I don't think they were

371
00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
overly enamoured with the rose flavour,
but that's okay.

372
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got to try these things.

373
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] My choux pastry wasn't
up to scratch, and it's Pastry Week.

374
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll have to try and pull it
out of the bag in the technical.

375
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just need to tell myself
I have a functioning brain

376
00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and hopefully, my brain will function,

377
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I will do
a technical challenge successfully.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your filo pastry should be made
using a traditional laminating technique

393
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

395
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Filo pastry. I've never

-Baklava.

411
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The hardest part is the lamination.

412
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Above all,
you've got to get that flake.

413
00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's three layers,
and then, you have the nut layer,

414
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then three layers again.

415
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got to make your dough
and divide it into six.

416
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Three for the bottom, three for the top.

417
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it.

418
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've gotta do that six times, times six.

419
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, there's a lot of layers

420
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-by the time you're finished.
-Yeah.

421
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they haven't laminated it,
you're gonna get a solid piece of dough.

422
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're not gonna get
that beautiful filo pastry

423
00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is what we're gonna be looking for.

424
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, let's cut a slice.

425
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Oh, that
looks beautiful. Thank you.

426
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Who is really gonna come up
trumps in the tent? I have no idea.

427
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because this is complicated

428
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I' gonna tell myself I can do it
because I have to,

429
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because otherwise I'm going home
and I refuse to go home.

430
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
First step is for the filo pastry.

431
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Put the dry ingredients into a bowl,
then combine with wet ingredients."

432
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Two eggs, vegetable oil,
some butter, and some white wine vinegar.

433
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Full-fat Greek yogurt as well.

434
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Greek yogurt.

435
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe] There you go.

436
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I suppose the yogurt is in there
because it's a Greek recipe.

437
00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Hello.
-[Giuseppe] Hey, Matt.

438
00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, have you
made baklava before?

439
00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have never made baklava
nor filo pastry before.

440
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] You haven't?
-It's a massive hassle.

441
00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why would you? You just buy it.

442
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a what? A massive…
-Hassle.

443
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, has…
-Hassle.

444
00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hassle?
-Hassle.

445
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, my word. I genuinely thought
you said something else there.

446
00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A massive hassle.

447
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Please don't write in to complain.
-[emphasis on H] Hassle.

448
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] All right,
just got me hands in there.

449
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] Right. Gonna knead
the hell out of this.

450
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] I don't want to have
too much gluten in here.

451
00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just enough that it holds together.

452
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[panting] Now I'm out of breath.

453
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've invented, like,
a new dance move here.

454
00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-D'you think?
-Any other moves?

455
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, there's this one which is kind of…
It's called "the side shuffle".

456
00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then, you've got, like, a little…

457
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The slam?
-The slam.

458
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I've got a good one, which is
"the taste" where you go like this.

459
00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[mimicking Paul]
"It's underproved."

460
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just doing it because other people
are doing it. Don't know what it does.

461
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, it's gotta go
six equal balls now.

462
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] Dough feels very soft.
It's pretty good.

463
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Roll out the balls of dough to a square
approximately 30 centimetres."

464
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] The key part of baklava is having
layers of really thin, crispy pastry.

465
00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] "Fold the top and bottom
into the centre, creating a rough square."

466
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Take each corner and fold
into the middle, dust with corn flour."

467
00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is laminating
to create layers in filo.

468
00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>To create the multi layers</i>
<i>of flaky pastry Baklava is famous for…</i>

469
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lizzie] Corner to corner…

470
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>…the bakers must intricately fold</i>

471
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>in a process called lamination.</i>

472
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I'm taking the edges
to the centre.

473
00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Usually you create layers using fat.

474
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But in this instance,
we're using cornflour.

475
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[groans] I don't know
if this is right. Like that?

476
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great, and we'll do that six times now.

477
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One, two, three, four.

478
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] Fold in the edges,
dust, now we're talking.

479
00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Jürgen] Last one.
-"Cover and rest."

480
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I'm covering it
and resting it.

481
00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm measuring out
my pistachio kernels.

482
00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The filling needs to provide
that crunchy texture.

483
00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amanda] I might give them
a little haircut.

484
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

486
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

488

489
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I glued that there while you were asleep.

490
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no, did you?

491
00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"To assemble, roll the dough into six

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rolling it back out. Again.

493
00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] All right. That's layer one.

494
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] Right. Two of six.

495
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lizzie] This is a bit of a dodgy layer.

496
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

497
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] You want a fair bit of filling.

498
00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna be rolling out
the three discs,

499
00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
cover it up, and then
proceed with the next steps.

500
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

501
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

505
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

an easier way than this.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

507
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do I cut all the way through
or do I just put it on the top?

You talking to me?

00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is they run out of time,
'cause when you bake it,

683
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you then need a decent length of time
to cool it enough to cut it.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very bold. I love the design.

1029
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I like the fish.
The scales look great.

1030
00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look inside, shall we?

1031
00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Held together,
and there's the fish going through there.

1032
00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yeah, little fish.

1033
00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] You've nearly got that spot on.

1034
00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love that.

1035
00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your pastry's too thick,
but I quite like the flavour.

1036
00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's remarkable

1037
00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the spinach and the fish
are not overcooked,

1038
00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because they've been
in there a long time.

1039
00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks.

1040
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's a really perfect owl, isn't it?

1041
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[in high-pitched voice] Ow, don't hurt me!

1042
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue chuckles]

1043
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The design is fantastic.

1044
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Good pastry.

1045
00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's firm enough, erm, but it's crumbly.

1046
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cheese and all the flavours
blends well with the beef.

1047
00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks very professional.

1048
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very Giuseppe.

1049
00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's excellent, Giuseppe.

1050
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The pastry, you've cracked it slightly,

1051
00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
handling it out the tin.

1052
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Juice was leaking out of there.

1053
00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Looks lovely.

1054
00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You get apricot, you get gherkin.
I think all the flavours work well.

1055
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] But the design
is pretty uninspiring.

1056
00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs chuckles]

1057
00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a big deal for me, that was.

1058
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I love the vine leaves.

1059
00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Aw, look at that.

1060
00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] I think it's beautiful.
-[Prue] Really beautifully done.

1061
00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the pastry tastes delicious.
But the beef, it's gone very, very dry.

1062
00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is a bit too dry,

1063
00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you get away with it
because you've got the horseradish.

1064
00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Thank you, Jürgen.

1065
00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened?

1066
00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amanda] I should have
really got it in the oven earlier

1067
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it had time to cool down.

1068
00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But when I took out the side of it,

1069
00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
one side came away.

1070
00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Oh, right, okay.

1071
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That's very good looking.

1072
00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very pretty.

1073
00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's bone dry.

1074
00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your seasoning is pretty strong.

1075
00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's so many things going on
in your mouth you try to identify,

1076
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but there's just a mix
of a lot of different things.

1077
00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I do like the paté.

1078
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me, the paté is the one thing
that is a bit too strong.

1079
00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Thank you, Amanda.

1080
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite dramatic.

1081
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the two-tone pastry.

1082
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's under-baked
and it's collapsed down.

1083
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I got it in the oven late,
which is unfortunate.

1084
00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My tray's under there, Paul.

1085
00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-All right.
-It was too hot to handle.

1086
00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Nice interior.

1087
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

1088
00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm.

1089
00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That sausage, mate…

1090
00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I question whether it's cooked. [chuckles]

1091
00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I probed it three times, Paul.

1092
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You did?
-Ninety-two in the centre.

1093
00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, okay.

1094
00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It is a bit mushy.
-It's very mushy, yeah.

1095
00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a pity because the bacon,
that is delicious.

1096
00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a shame, that, George.

1097
00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1098
00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Such a beautiful cottage.

1099
00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I love all the little flowers
and the way you've decorated them

1100
00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and had time to paint them.

1101
00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Aw, look at that.

1102
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Wow.

1103
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] That looks so cool.

1104
00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The colour layers are lovely.
You've separated them with sweet potato.

1105
00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Prue] I love that.

1106
00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have you seen this here?

1107
00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

1108
00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God!

1109
00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-[all applauding]

1110
00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That… that curry,

1111
00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the way you've
broken it down into sections…

1112
00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:05.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And each one, for me, the spice blend,
the hot water crust pastry, the design…

1113
00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I absolutely agree.
-Fantastic.

1114
00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's brave to make curry pie.

1115
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a witty, it's charming,

1116
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and often, things that are
witty and charming

1117
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
are not also absolutely delicious.

1118
00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you've got the pastry perfectly.

1119
00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Spot on.

1120
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Really good.
-Well done.

1121
00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] Thank you so much.

1122
00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] A handshake
on a showstopper? That's very rare.

1123
00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God.

1124
00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] I'm just in so much shock.

1125
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was like, "Something's gone wrong,"
then out came his hand and I just died.

1126
00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I literally died.

1127
00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, so maybe I'm a ghost.
Maybe that's why I feel weird.

1128
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[George] They complimented the design,
which was good.

1129
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm trying to focus on the positive,
but I do feel like I'm in danger.

1130
00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Amanda] It is what it is.

1131
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Someone has to go home, and if it's
my time to go, then it's my time to go.

1132
00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] We should pay tribute
to these bakers

1133
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the standard has been
so good this week.

1134
00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then coming into today,

1135
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we were talking about Amanda and Lizzie
in a little bit of trouble,

1136
00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the person
who did well out of this was Lizzie,

1137
00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-because I think she saved herself.
-[Noel] Mm.

1138
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To the detriment of George.

1139
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
George and Amanda
are in a little bit of trouble.

1140
00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
George, today,
I wasn't happy at all with that.

1141
00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, Star Baker is…

1142
00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Star Baker is
either Giuseppe or Crystelle.

1143
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She really smashed it.
You gave her a handshake.

1144
00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know. I don't like giving handshakes.

1145
00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know…

1146
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It hurts you, doesn't it?
-It does.

1147
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Ultimately, that deserved it.

1148
00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It was a bit of magic.
-[Paul] It was. Very clever.

1149
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think Giuseppe
has done really well as well.

1150
00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looked amazing.

1151
00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I loved his meat, though…

1152
00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

1153
00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you talking about Giuseppe's meat?

1154
00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause I looked down just as I said it.
That's what it was.

1155
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We're all friends here.
-I know.

1156
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, bakers, on another week.

1157
00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not easy to find a Star Baker,
but the judges have done it.

1158
00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This week's Star Baker is…

1159
00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crystelle!

1160
00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[contestants clapping]

1161
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. God.

1162
00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, that means I've got the horrible job
of announcing the person who's leaving us.

1163
00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This gets tougher,
it does get tougher every week,

1164
00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and this has been an amazing week.

1165
00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the person who is
leaving us this week is…

1166
00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Amanda.

1167
00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ah.
-Thank you.

1168
00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's okay, you're all right.

1169
00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Is it all right?
-I knew it was me. You kept looking at me.

1170
00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amanda] I mean, you gotta go sometime,
haven't you?

1171
00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't think, when I got here,
I'd get that far

1172
00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
after seeing all the other bakers,
but I've had such a good time.

1173
00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[George] We'll miss you.

1174
00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll be all right.
I'll see you in a few weeks.

1175
00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amanda] You know what?
I came here to have a good time.

1176
00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a little bit stressful here,
but it's a kind of fun stress.

1177
00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps if I didn't talk so much
I might've got a bit further.

1178
00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I enjoyed it,
so I'm glad I did what I did.

1179
00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] Oh, God…

1180
00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm in utter shock. My name was going
over and over in my head.

1181
00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was preparing myself, and I was just
saying, "George, George, George."

1182
00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then they called Amanda
and I could not believe it.

1183
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This has given me a big push
to fight for my place.

1184
00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That pie…
-[squealing]

1185
00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I don't often give out
handshakes in showstoppers,

1186
00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but Crystelle deserved it.

1187
00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was perfection in my eyes.

1188
00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>-</i>[Chanelle]<i> Hello.</i>
-Hi, Chanelle. Is everyone there?

1189
00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chanelle] <i>Yeah.</i>

1190
00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got Star Baker!

1191
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[women screaming over phone]

1192
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[speaking indistinctly over phone]

1193
00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Chanelle over phone] <i>What do you mean?</i>
-And guys…

1194
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Guys, guys, Paul gave me
a handshake in the showstopper.

1195
00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:28.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[women exclaiming
and speaking indistinctly over phone]

1196
00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] Oh, God.

1197
00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And people wonder why I'm loud.

1198
00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]
