best just to stay clear of it.

202
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] That's half an hour.

204
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I've got about 15 minutes
until I make the Winston knot.

205
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I've got two minutes
until I make the Winston knot

206
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and 15 minutes in which to do them.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] I'm just bread measuring.

209
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think we should
give them Roman soldier names,

210
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause this is what
the Roman army used to eat.

211
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-So that's Maximus.

212
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Maximus.
-Decimus, Aurelius, and, erm...

213
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Stuart.

214

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] These two get crossed over.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

217
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Apparently, it's like
a French sort of design.

218
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit different
to like the traditional knot shape

219
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think it would be easy to get things
to look the same, but it's not.

220
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm glad I went to Scouts.

221
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not sure
it did much for my knot-making skills.

222
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] That is now going to prove again.

223
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just gonna give them like 20 minutes.

224
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To get it in there. It's cinnamon,
sugar and chocolate chips.

225
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Weighing out my ciabatta
so it can go on for its second prove.

226
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is called a couche,
which is French for bed,

227
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it just gives the dough
a little bit of support while it's rising.

228
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bring it to bed.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] I'd really like to give it
a long time to second prove,

231
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I'd rather it be baked in the oven,
so I need to get them in.

232
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] I'm running out of time.

233
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They gotta go in, ready or not.

234
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] This is flavoured dough.

235
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's only gonna get
a little bit of a prove.

236
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, I need to get a wriggle on now.

237
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was a bit of a balls that one.

238
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven sighs in exasperation]

239
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] Start them off quite high

240
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'm sure they'll get a nice crust
on them and then I'll drop it down.

241
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] I wanted to give them
another 15 minutes proving,

242
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I would rather they were baked.

243
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you only have half an hour left.

244
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not the best they've looked,
but at least they're not worse.

245
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think I'm gonna have
enough oven space,

246
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so what I'm gonna have to do
is move these all onto one baking sheet.

247
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, let's get these babies in the oven.

248
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These, actually,
have puffed up quite quickly.

249
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] These are my spelt loaves.

250
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm scoring them 'cause as they rise,

251
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if I didn't, they'd just burst out
at the weakest point, which is usually

252
00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
on the bottom.

253
00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] That's annoyingly misshapen.

254
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] It's really not enough space.

255
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] That's everything in now,

256
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
by the skin of my teeth.
So hopefully they won't be under baked.

257
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One has split horribly in the middle.

258
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Probably in my haste
to get them in the oven.

259
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs in exasperation] No pressure.

260
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] I'm concerned there won't be
enough air bubbles in my ciabatta,

261
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I'm afraid that my spelt
will be like bricks. [chuckles]

262
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Feel like I want to do
one of those yoga poses.

263
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, oh, actually. Oh. [laughs]

264
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] What's happening in there?
[Steven] My loaf has split.

265
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's okay though, isn't it?

266
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not the end of the world,
it's just irritating.

267
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hmm, imagine if it was
the end of the world.

268
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your loaves split
and everything went... [makes bomb noises]

269
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] Should've got them in sooner.

270
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna whip them out
in about one minute to go.

271
00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] Well, I hope it's tasteful,
carry me a little bit.

272
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How long have we got left?
-Just one minute remaining.

273
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] Really don't wanna drop
any of these,

274
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause that would just be horrific.

275
00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven]
This is what happens when you rush.

276
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] God, they're all split open.

277
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up.

278
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not very happy with ciabatta.

279
00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

everyone's looks beautiful.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think they look very good.

284
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do like the plait, it's a little bit
under proved, but not much.

285
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The naan bread looks interesting.
I wouldn't call that a ciabatta really.

286
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Well, let's see how it tastes.

287
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I must say that
I'm impressed by the look of them,

288
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
especially the spelt ones.

289
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think, it looks really good.

290
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Sounds good.

291
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It is slightly under proved,

292
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and therefore, what follows
is it's slightly under baked.

293
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I'll tell you what,
the flavour is lovely.

294
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Really nice flavour.

295
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think spelt bread
is not the tastiest.

296
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Good start.

297
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Let's look at this ciabatta,
shall we?

298
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I always cut ciabatta's this way

299
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause you get more
of an indication of the overall structure.

300
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A pretty nice structure,
but not as open as it could be.

301
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Smells really mushroomy.
They were dried mushrooms, weren't they?

302
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, some dried, some sautéed.

303
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It works. It brings you
two different textures then.

304
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And they do taste very, very good.

305
00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wouldn't call it a ciabatta though.

306
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, let's have a look at this.

307
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great structure.

308
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great, look at that.

309
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And you know
the orange really works,

310
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't think it would.

311
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Excellent flavour. Soft crumb.

312
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Great texture on the outside,
and the plaiting's very good as well.

313
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much indeed.
-Thank you.

314
00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hmm, they definitely do look
a little different, don't they?

315
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that one does not look
much like that one.

316
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They do look pretty terrible,
but look at the consistency,

317
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they do look awful.

318
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] So the bread
has the garlic running through it

319
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then there's some cheese
and rosemary in the centre.

320
00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Smells good.

321
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's actually a little disappointing
'cause it's quite tough.

322
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Your dough needed more water.
-Okay.

323
00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Dry dough
will split wherever it wants to go,

324
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that's what's caused that,

325
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
-and that to all be totally different.

326
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Paul] These don't look good either.

327
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's massively under proved.

328
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rye bread tends to rip
because that one there...

329
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Yeah. I agree
with those he's trying to put away.

330
00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It instantly means
that you've under proved it.

331
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Paul] But let's have a taste.

332
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's probably gonna
be slightly doughy inside.

333
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it tastes like gluey in your...

334
00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Mmm.

335
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...in your mouth. Nice flavour though.

336
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Beautiful flavour.

337
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just right the rye and the spelt.

338
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The Winston knots...

339
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] They are so artisanal
and real and beautiful.

340
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's always tricky
when you put something into the middle.

341
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does it destroy the crumb?

342
00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've done quite well
on the sweet one there.

343
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is very good.

344
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's delicious.

345
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the chocolate's really good,
and you've got just enough cinnamon,

346
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's not overpowering.

347
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Under proved, under proved, perfect.

348
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much, Steven.
-Thank you.

349
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Thank you.
[Paul] Thank you.

350
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must say, I think these are interesting

351
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and they look absolutely beautiful.

352
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Now this is the spelt?
-Yeah.

353
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's got a little rip
but a nice neat pattern.

354
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not gonna fault the actual flavour,

355
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
except that I think
if you'd had a little salt in there,

356
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you'd have enhanced it.

357
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, I quite like it.

358
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You push it, it springs back,
which is a good sign.

359
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look at these.

360
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice. That's the sound I like to hear.

361
00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great structure.

362
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can tell, you see
where the knife drags the dough?

363
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn't cut through
like a cake, it's pulling.

364
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you have this tension there.

365
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the texture's perfect.

366
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice and crisp on the outside.

367
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm getting a little bit of flavour
in there as well, which is good.

368
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-[Sandi] That's a good one.

369
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, right.
-[Prue] Right.

370
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, let's look at these ones.

371
00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a filled one, isn't it?
-[Kate] Yeah.

372
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I see.

373
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] Oh, no.
[Sandi] You all right?

374
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's he thinking? [laughs]

375
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] You can never tell.

376
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll tell you what I think.

377
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's got a lovely texture.

378
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's properly baked,

379
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the curry,
and I like the flaky edge.

380
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It tastes divine.

381
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The structure's spot on,
I like the filling.

382
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Something I might even look at.
-[chuckles]

383
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think overall you've done very well.

384
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Well done, Kate.
-Thanks.

385
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is much better
than expected. Whoo. [laughs]

386
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I... I mean.

387
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did it as well as
I could've done in the time.

388
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I thought bread was gonna be my undoing,</i>

389
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's nice to know
I'm not starting from behind.

390
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] <i>I am frustrated with myself.</i>

391
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But then I think, "What's the point?"
It's not going to change anything.

392
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's time for your
final Technical Challenge,

395
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which today has been set for you by Prue.

396
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue have you been
kind to the finalists?

397
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

398
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all about the bake.

399
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No treble.

400
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] It's all about the bake.
[Prue] It's all about the bake.

401
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As ever, the Technical
will be judged blind.

402
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm gonna have to ask you
crazy kids to skedaddle. Off you go.

403
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For your final Technical Challenge,

404
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue would like you
to make ten ginger biscuits

405
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
baked to perfection with a powerful snap.

406
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue wants half of them to be oval,
and the other half to be square,

407
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-Get set.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...bake.

[Noel] <i>The finalists</i>

[Steven clears throat]

413
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

414
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It seems quite straightforward,
which worries me.

415
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Some lace pattern,
it does look complicated.

416
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] <i>This is the final,</i>

417
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and what could be more of a classic
British bake than a ginger biscuit.

418
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are exquisite.

419
00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all Royal icing.

420
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've said it must be
exactly these decorations.

421
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They should be able to look at that

422
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and know that they should first pipe
the outline and then flood it.

423
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course, you'll need a thicker icing

424
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
for the baubles
than you need for the flooding.

425
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although, the icing
is very intricate and difficult to do,

426
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we want a really crisp
perfect biscuit. Beautiful.

427
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we are looking for a nice snap
with these biscuits, aren't we?

428
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Still a wafer.
-Make it crack.

429
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the fact you're dunking.

430
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Are you?

431
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You didn't see it.
-You're never too posh to dunk.

432
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dead right.

433
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It just says, "Make the ginger biscuits
using the creaming method."

434

After this morning, I'd like to do
much better in this afternoon's Technical.

435
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit hard to get
tablespoons of beaten egg.

436
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] One, two.

437
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm expecting that
to be quite a stiff dough.

438
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Done it wrong. I put too much egg in.

439
00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] I was focusing
so much on the muscovado

440
00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that I put too much egg in.

441
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Awkward.

442
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

443
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, try again.

444
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
After each stage they need to be frozen.

445
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] It's quite a wet dough.

446
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I expect it will firm up
when it gets in the fridge.

447
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie]
There is no indication of thickness.

448
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just give it a couple of millimetres.

449
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You want them nice and thin.

450
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Will it fit? [chuckles]
It's not gonna fit.

451
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kate's done it wrong again.

452
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, this isn't idea.

453
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is human error in action.

[Sandi] <i>Two hours remaining</i>

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Make 8 x 8 square templates
and a 10 x 7 oval.

456
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is not 10 x 7.

457
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm gonna have to free hand.

458
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oval's free hand I'm assuming,
which will be unamusing.

459
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have never drawn

461
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not very ovally, it's annoying me.

462
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, that's probably close enough.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

471
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

473
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It needs to be quite a lot bigger.

474
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] Just gonna freeze those,
and then stick in the oven.

475
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] They shouldn't
take that long to bake.

476
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] I'm gonna cut them out afterwards,
'cause I don't want the outsides to burn.

477
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All about finesse.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you are halfway
through your ginger biscuits.

479
00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's get these in the oven.

480
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] Doesn't even say
how long to bake the biscuits for.

481
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Just says bake.

482
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm going up to seven minutes
and check them thereafter.

483
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eight minutes. That sounds about right.

484
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] I'm doing it for five minutes.

485
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will keep an eye on it though.
It's all about the bake.

486
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] Prue said,

487
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] This is royal icing,
icing sugar, egg whites and lemon juice.

489
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] Alls I can taste is just sweet air.

490
00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Try not to mix it too hard

491
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause the icing sugar
will get away with me.

492
00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

browning around the edge.

494
00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is how I normally do it
'cause I didn't want the edges to burn.

495
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tempted to put them
back in actually, couple more minutes.

496
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gonna put the squares back in,
they just feel a little softer.

497
00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] I'm gonna get them back
in the oven.

498
00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

499
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] Just doing them in increments
of two minutes, just to see how they look.

500
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] It needs a little bit longer

501
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause if they'll have
a nice snap to them.

502
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] I think I am happy with those.

503
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] They're nice and thin,
they smell good.

504
00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] Couple more minutes.
Just like a minute.

505
00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They just spread a little bit.
I didn't freeze them long enough.

506
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

507
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Put them back in for
a little flash of like a minute.

514
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Simple right?

515
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's give it a go.

516
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A bit too dark. I've burned me biccies

517
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Sophie]
Definitely the fastest I've ever iced.

519
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Is it enjoyable?

520
00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I wouldn't go that far.
-[laughs]

521
00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] At home it took me
all day to ice 12 biscuits.

522
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Er, you've got four
and a half minutes per biscuit left.

523
00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Right.
-Yeah.

524
00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-I'm just thinking they're looking...

525
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're lovely, they're beautiful,
they're a little on the plain side.

526
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] I'm having two different
consistencies for piping and for flooding.

527
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] A lot more to do
than pipe the first lot.

528
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No time to redo anything.

529
00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is so much intricate detail on here.

530
00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I can just get
some basics done on these.

531
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] Draw the line,
and then it kind of semi-sets.

532
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flood the white icing
and then pipe the flower straight on top.

533
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] I should've
just done that in hindsight,

534
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I decided to flood ice everything.

535
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] What I'm going to do
is do the same on each one

536
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then go back and add detail.

537
00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] Well, I think everyone's got
their own technique for flood icing now.

538
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I run out of time,
I'll just have to serve them, won't I?

539
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] My hand is surprisingly steady
actually considering how nervous I am.

540
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think everybody
needs to learn how to speed pipe.

541
00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

542
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] Just not enough time at all.

543
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] If I can just get as much done
on these coloured ones.

544
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] I'm just gonna pipe
some dots round the flooded ones.

545
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] I literally can't give you
eye contact right now

546
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
unless you're a biscuit
and you need some icing on you.

547
00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, look how many
biscuit's that are un-iced.

548
00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do you want me to do one for you?
-No.

549
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] I haven't actually taken
more than about three breaths

550
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in the last two minutes.

551
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] I haven't breathed,
I haven't looked up.

552
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're looking increasingly messier.

553
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] It's actually really hard
going on your hand.

554
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

555
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Back's killing me.

556
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, time is up.

557

with this one then, Prue?

564
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

565
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Likewise with the oval.
There has been flooding.

566
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The icing is nice and thin.
It could've been a little bit thinner

573
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Paul] Yeah, but the problem is,

579
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

582
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

583
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

587
00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

It's flooded well, this.

589
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just think it's lost something.

590
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The piping here is not blobs.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Technical, is then Steven, Sophie,

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the Showstopper is going to be the winner.

Paul and Prue would love you
to make a large entremet.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
An entremet is a light delicate
multi-layered cake

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your entremet must have
a minimum of five elements,

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
one of which must be sponge,

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the entire cake
should be covered in perhaps a glaze.

634
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or maybe a ganache, whichever you choose.

635
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your entremet should be decorated

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and when sliced,
should hold together perfectly

637
00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with each of the
delicate layers clearly visible.

638
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] You have five hours.

The three bakers are probably
very, very nervous.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they need to bring in
other elements too.

647

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

It's a big entremet.
It's two halves, it'll be a yin yang.

727
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

739
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

740
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was in Sweden.
I remember the snow on the ground.

741
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you could see the galaxy in the sky,
and you saw the Northern Lights.

742
00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] Cool, right. Caramelised honey,
set custard. Usually I'd set overnight,

743
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I've had to put more gelatine in
than I'd want to.

744
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

746
00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] A layer of custard

747
00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

748
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

go back in the freezer.

750

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm starting the Genoise now.

752
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is gonna be the sponge element.

753
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I picked Genoise because it's light
and airy, but it has structure.

754
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is for my orange sponge.
It's actually a financier recipe,

755
00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is like a little petit fours.

756
00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's almost got a chewy texture.
It's gonna be right at the bottom.

757
00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Using this pan
to just get it as flat as I can.

758
00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you're stacking,
everything's a little bit out.

759
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a cumulative effect.

760
00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna cut it into a circle,

761
00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so it doesn't need to be neat round
the edges or anything like that.

762
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gonna go in the oven.

763
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] This is the last layer of custard
going on top of the bananas,

764
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and we're gonna do
a final freeze to get it solid.

765
00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I knew this would take a while,
but it is the star of the show. Right.

766
00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Bakers, you're halfway through.

767
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got two and a half hours left,

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

769
00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

772

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] This is the coconut dacquoise,

774
00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
essentially it is like
a meringue with coconut.

775
00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] So I'm making
a batch of honeycomb

776
00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I'm gonna crush that up,
and it's gonna go in between chocolate.

777
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My feuilletine layer,

778
00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's basically like
a really crushed Rice Krispy cake.

779
00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like the Honey Monster's heart.

780
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's nice, isn't it?

781
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just gonna look at this for a bit.

782
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's making me sort of wistful.

783
00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, nice and springy.

784
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] That's lucky,
I almost forgot about that. [chuckles]

785
00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] This is the frozen insert.

786
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wanna get it cut
so I can get it back into the freezer,

787
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
just to give it
a little bit more chilling time.

788
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There you go. Easy does it.

789
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>Before they can begin</i>
<i>assembling their final Showstopper,</i>

[Kate] There's so many processes.

792
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>...need to perfect a mousse</i>

793
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:17.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the chocolate mousse.

794
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For my mousse,
it's white chocolate and lavender.

795
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So this is the yuzu
and white chocolate bavarois.

796
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got a really unique flavour.

797
00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit experimental
and that's what I wanted to do.

798
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Most of the flavours I think are terrific.

799
00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Kate's coconut and yuzu
will be very good together.

800
00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're not too aggressive.

801
00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sophie's gone for
the most diverse flavours

802
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I've ever heard of.

803
00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Spot of lavender there, smell it.

804
00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lavender and lemon.

805
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] I initially
went really subtle with it,

806
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I'm putting a fair amount in.

807
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm a little bit worried about Steven's.
Chocolate is so dominant.

808
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Has he bitten off
more than he can chew?

809
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Yeah.
[Paul] He's often come to a point

810
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
where timing has been his downfall.

811
00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want all of them

812
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-to finish what they've started.
-[Prue] Me too. Me too.

813
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Is Steven gonna finish?

814
00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Sophie's is very complicated.

815
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And actually, is Kate gonna be able

816
00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to give it the finesse
that she very often lacks?

817
00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just gotta give yourself
as much time as possible

818
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to concentrate on the assembly,

819
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is why I'm trying
to fly through these bits.

820
00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] I'm gonna go

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and hopefully they've set just enough.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think everything is just
about set and we can go ahead.

[Kate] It's all gotta be
spot on first time.

827
00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Steven] Ugh, it's a bit too sloppy.

829
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's get it out.

830
00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the lemon curd.

831
00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] I'm gonna let it freeze
for another ten minutes,

832
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
just to reset everything.

833
00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] Push the sponge.

834
00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Caramelised honey.

835
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Trying to use every single spare second.

836
00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It means that
I'm prepared for the next step.

837
00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] This is the feuilletine.

838
00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] That is Japan in a cake tin.

839
00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] This is raspberry coulis
going over the sponges.

840
00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] Back in the freezer,
and to set for as long as I can.

841
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] This is gonna set now.

842
00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm gonna start
doing all my decorations.

843
00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna start off
by doing the honeycomb.

844
00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm gonna use a bit of bubble wrap.

845
00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] This is gonna be messy,
but I'm gonna have to do it.

846
00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm just tipping these into the moulds.

847
00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, they're in.

848
00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is cocoa butter on acetate,

849
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then I'm gonna use
melted chocolate on top of this.

850
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Take half the jam with me.

851
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's meant to be my honey bee.
I stuck down little strips of tape

852
00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then painted coloured cocoa butter on,
so the chocolate will show through,

853
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and he'll have stripes
Don't know why it's a he.

854
00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, it is a he isn't it,
'cause only the Queen's... Yeah.

855
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] This freezes.

856
00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, my gorgeous finalists,
you've got one hour left.

857
00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The entremet needed half an hour more
than it's gonna get in the freezer.

858
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] Got a nice shine on it, hasn't it?

859
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on. Come on, freeze, freeze, freeze.

860
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is a dragon fruit.
It's gonna be decoration for the top.

861
00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] So soft that I'm worried

862
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's not gonna hold
when I take it out the mould.

863
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales air sharply]

864
00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] I have got a chocolate collar.

865
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] This is gonna be
tuile if it hopefully works.

866
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Keep calm. Keep the nerves under control.
-Yeah.

867
00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Here, sweetie.
-Thank you so much.

868
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] Probably should've
done bigger wings.

869
00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna get it out
and have a look at it.

870
00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] It's set enough.

871
00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[inhales air deeply] Right,
just carry on. Just carry on.

872
00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got an entremet. Whether it's a
good entremet remains to be seen, eh?

873
00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Yeah, that's set fine.

874
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gonna work on my mirror-glaze.

875
00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Let me get this entremet out.

876
00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's holding its shape,
I just gotta be so careful.

877
00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] It needs to be 30 degrees Celsius.

878
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Bakers, just 15 minutes.

879
00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gonna be close. Gonna be close.

880
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is white chocolate and cocoa butter.

881
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] Right,
I think that I'm gonna go for it.

882
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Right.

883
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The best you're gonna get out of that.
Oh, God, don't inhale cocoa butter.

884
00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Moment of truth.

885
00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It look a bit more like marble
but less squiggly.

886
00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Wish me luck.

887
00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I can't present something beautiful,
I'll present what I can.

888
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Got to add the chocolate collar.

889
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no, bit of a crack.

890
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to get it on a cake stand.

891
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Yin needs to meet Yang.

892
00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wha...

893
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] It's on.

894
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not the beautiful entremet I imagined.

895
00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] There's cracks
all over the place.

896
00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have one minute.

897
00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whistles] Where are me balls?

898
00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, Steven.

899
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's he doing? What's he doing?

900
00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] Come on, come on,
come on. Don't leave.

901
00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you final challenge is over.

902
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow!

903
00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] What a relief.
It's all over, it's all over.

904
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[speaking indistinctly]

905
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] Well done.
-[laughs] Well done.

906
00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Well done. Well done.
[Sandi] You did it. Congratulations.

907
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] You got through it.
[Sophie] Well, you've done well...

908
00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Right, it's not all...
-Well done.

909
00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles] Our kids have all grown up.

910
00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[cheering and applauding]

911
00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi whistles]

912
00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm crying now.

913
00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite beautiful, actually.

914
00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Baked our little socks off.

915
00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] <i>Outside the tent,</i>

916
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

918
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had butterflies this morning
coming back to the tent,

919
00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is ridiculous,
considering I'm not baking.

920
00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is really amazing to be back.
I've missed everyone so much.

921
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Hi, how are you?"
It's like sort of like a reunion.

922
00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I had to pick a winner, er...

923
00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

924
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It'd be like choosing
your favourite child.

925
00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are all fantastic bakers.

926
00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want Steven to win.
He has taught me so much.

927
00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As long as he doesn't do rubbery jelly
he'll be fine.

928
00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Probably say Sophie, you know.

929
00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Being a Northern lass, I'd like Katie.

930
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I honestly don't know who it's gonna be.

931
00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispers] Steven.

932
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[snickers]

933
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>It's judgement time</i>
<i>for the final show stopping entremets.</i>

934
00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sophie, please bring up
your final Showstopper.

935
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thank you, Sophie. Can you tell us
all about your entremet please?

936
00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I've named my entremet,
"Ode to the Honey Bee."

937
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's an orange blossom financier sponge
and there is a blackberry jelly.

938
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:35.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then there is a feuilletine
caramelised honey custard,

939
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a set lemon curd, a white chocolate
and lavender mousse, and a mirror-glaze.

940
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think the overall look
is absolutely beautiful.

941
00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's original, it's pretty,
the marbling is absolutely stunning.

942
00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul]
The collar's broken up a little bit,

943
00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the honeycomb with the bee,
with the flower, with the marble,

944
00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think is exceptional.
-Thank you.

945
00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Wow, the knife just fell through.

946
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That's great.

947
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at that.

948
00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is just set,

949
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they're not running
into each other, the layers?

950
00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very neat, the jelly especially.

951
00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] And it's just holding together.

952
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is amazing.

953
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm, lemon and lavender,
has got to be the new taste.

954
00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

955
00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

956
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love it.

957
00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Being the theme
of the entremet is the honey,

958
00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that's the first thing you get,
and it's not overly sweet.

959
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The jelly with that little tartness,

960
00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the sponge is just right

961
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause it gives it that little bit
of bite to the whole thing.

962
00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And even the lemon
and the lavender work as well.

963
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Every one of the creamy, jelly layers
is the right degree of gelatine.

964
00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not rubbery, it's not liquid,

965
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and on top of all that,
it tastes fantastic.

966
00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you.

967
00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Thank you so much.

968
00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

969
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kate, would you like to bring
your entremet up to the table, please?

970
00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue chuckles] Oh, flew off.

971
00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kate, remind us about your entremet.

972
00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's yuzu and white chocolate bavarois

973
00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
on top of coconut dacquoise
with lychee jelly and yuzu zest sponge,

974
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then a yuzu and white chocolate glaze.

975
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's tremendously unusual
and beautifully done.

976
00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The glaze is as shiny as a bathroom tile.

977
00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The mirror-finish
you got on the top is beautiful,

978
00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the colour choices are superb.

979
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, that dropped really well, actually.

980
00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Oh, look at that. Wow. Wow.

981
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They're big,
and they're bold, and they're equal.

982
00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that yuzu flavour is just
so sharp and delicious, and surprising.

983
00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It starts of tasting like grapefruit,
and then you know it's not grapefruit.

984
00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, it's lovely.

985
00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the flavour combinations.

986
00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bavarois, it's that light citrus.

987
00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And have you put that
in the jelly as well?

988
00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because it's got this beautiful citrus
hit as well in there.

989
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That meringue and coconut
is a little stroke of genius

990
00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because it's a different flavour.

991
00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very harmonious
with the lemony flavours

992
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it's drier than the bavarois,

993
00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so you get the contrast of texture
and the contrast of flavour

994
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and I think it's really beautiful.
-Okay.

995
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The jelly melts in the mouth,
not too much gelatine in there.

996
00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sponge and then
that light bavarois is sublime.

997
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd eat that all day.

998
00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Sandi] Well done.

999
00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] Thank you.

1000
00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done, Kate.
-This could make you win.

1001
00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good luck, Steve.

1002
00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1003
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Steven, please bring up
your final Showstopper.

1004
00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Steven, tell us all about
your entremet, please.

1005
00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So insider there is a hazelnut dacquoise,
Genoise sponge with a raspberry coulis.

1006
00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is bananas and custard
surrounded by chocolate mousse.

1007
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On the yin side
is white chocolate flocking,

1008
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and on the yang side, galaxy mirror glaze.

1009
00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is extraordinary glazing.

1010
00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks like a shell, it's amazing.

1011
00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The contrast is there,
but I almost want this to be smoother

1012
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a little bit more refined.

1013
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This looks a little as if it's unfinished.

1014
00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna go for the mirror.

1015
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The distinctive layers
upsets me a little bit.

1016
00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because this all comes down to timing,

1017
00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-which I've said before.
-Yeah.

1018
00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The mirror glaze is not quite set,

1019
00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and so the knife is taking the colour
through to the next layer,

1020
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the next layer's
been pushed through to the next layer.

1021
00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Love the bananas,
love the chocolate mousse.

1022
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I was to close my eyes and eat that,

1023
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that's a chocolate mousse
with a bit of banana in.

1024
00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're not getting
too many textures in there.

1025
00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want to cut a bit of the other side

1026
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because that blue glaze
is making a muddle.

1027
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To me, it's exactly the same.
You've got bleeding of each of the layers.

1028
00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's hard to distinguish any layers

the chocolate and the banana.
It's almost too much of a good thing.

1030
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very rich and sweet.

1031
00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think you'd be
able to eat a lot of it.

1032
00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just think you missed the trick here.

1033
00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm.

[Sandi] <i>Paul and Prue</i>

The three bakers
came into the Showstopper pretty even.

1037
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So is this a very difficult decision?

1038
00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have elements in all these
which are just sheer perfection.

1039
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have something
exceptional from Sophie.

1040
00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sophie's marbling on top is just amazing.

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

from Kate is gorgeous.

On the other hand, I'm sure
Steven feels a little bit down,

1043
00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I don't think Steven's
is as good as the other two.

1044
00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Steven's let himself down a little bit.

1045
00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it comes down to this.

1047
00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the more I think about it,
I'm gonna change my mind.

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I got a little bit emotional there.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
