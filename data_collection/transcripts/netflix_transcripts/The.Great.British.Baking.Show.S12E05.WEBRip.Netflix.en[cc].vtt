432
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's basically spinach feta
in a filo parcel.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Filo's all about being thin.
It's about the layers.

434
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The longer they rest it,
the easier it is to work with.

435
00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It allows it to be rolled out
very, very thin.

436
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I imagine they have to get
the moisture levels right inside.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] You need to pat dry the spinach

438
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
just to take out
some of that excess water.

439
00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you don't, the whole thing'll be
soggy underneath.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the bake is critical.

441
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now 45 minutes minimum

[Prue] Look at all those layers.

443
00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Feta, spinach. It's just beautiful.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

that goes beautifully together,

446
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the crispiness that comes from the filo
is the real test.

You want to build up the gluten a bit,
so I am giving it a good knead.

457

It'll just tear.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

It's 'cause you're rushing the process.

[Sumayah] It's the right length,

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

half an hour to 45 minutes. [laughs]

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I'll keep an eye on it, but it'll need
every minute it's got and a few more.

I don't think I've got enough time,
so I've cranked up the oven a little bit.

Banging it up
just to get a bit of colour on there.

555
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

579
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to get all the moisture out of it,
otherwise it'll sog up the pastry.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

It could be down to the spinach.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Needed to be another loop
on the outside of that.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

622
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

655
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we've had the signature
and the technical,

656
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

as to who's doing well and who's not.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

658
00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

She was last.

660
00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have Dylan
that did okay-ish on the signature,

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Bit of that going on.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. And then we have Andy and Illiyin.
They're the ones who are in trouble.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've got Christiaan,
who didn't do too well in the signature

664
00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and yet came second in the technical.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

with a pool of people in the middle.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

and technical any more?

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The choux itself is all about
that crispiness on the outside.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because you're gonna fill that
with a mousseline, a praline, a cream.

703
00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It must be a very light
creamy filling inside

704
00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because what you don't want
is a stodgy crème pâtissière.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They have to make a stand
which is also edible.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

celebrating the Paris-Brest.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

are these stands to collapse

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the Paris-Brest
just fall all over the floor.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

we've got a little layer of pecan praline,

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
