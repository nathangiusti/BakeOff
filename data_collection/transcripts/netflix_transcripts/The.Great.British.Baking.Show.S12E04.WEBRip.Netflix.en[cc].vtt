I can't believe he did that again,

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

is enough for me.

[Mike] Paul thought the shortbread
could've been crisper,

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I was like, "That's fine."

412
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Definitely wasn't overbaked,
but they didn't like my bulge,

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is a bit of a personal comment,
but you know. [laughs]

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My caramel just turned to liquid
for some reason.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your technical challenge.

422
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I hear you say.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue, have you got any words of advice
for our bakers?

426
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so we'll have to ask these two

for a crisp, flaky rough puff pastry

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

making caramel twice

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The whole point in any puff pastry
is getting the lamination right,

447
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so they have to get on with it.

448
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've given them frozen butter
but if they let it sit on the side,

449
00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
by the time they roll and fold it,
it'll melt.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It'll just turn into a shortcrust.
-Yes.

451
00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Arrange the pears beautifully
and then they need to bake it

452
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
until the pastry is
a good proper dark colour.

-I would.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the lamination and flake
in that pastry is delicious.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not overdone, not bitter.

459
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Almost toffee-like. It's delicious.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just need a glass of Armagnac
to go with it.

Here we go. For the ice cream,
make a smooth crème anglaise.

I don't know these posh names, you know?
For me, it is a custard.

So I'm gonna heat up my milk and my cream
and then I'm peeling pears.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Mike] I might start making my rough puff.

482
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Old-fashioned way,
rub the butter into the flour.

483
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's two quantities of butter.
One to incorporate into the actual dough

484
00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the other one is in between the layers
to laminate it roughly.

485
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The butter melts
and it creates these air pockets

486
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and as soon as it hits a hot oven, poof!

487
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's going on? Oh, the rough puff?

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a hard one.
It's a lot of time though.

489
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I'm gonna dance probably, you know?

You lift me up or I lift you up?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'll start the first roll.

499
00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keep the butter as cold as you can.

500
00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

501
00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't wanna get that butter warm
because it'll turn into a briochey dough.

502
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My butter is definitely no longer frozen.
It's becoming smeared.

503
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Go in the fridge
and then we'll do another later.

504
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Illiyin] Okay. I'll make the praline.

505
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a dry caramel.

506
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Getting colour,
but I want the sugar to melt.

507
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to make sure I don't burn this.

508
00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

515
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gone dark, but it'll have to do.
We'll add the walnuts to the caramel.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Paul] Start with this.
Got molasses all over it.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I must say the pears
are nicely arranged.

617
00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Not much flake in there.

618
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pastry's lost its lamination.
The caramel's just gone too far. Burnt.

619
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ice cream's okay. A lovely flavour.

620

-[Prue] Next one.
-[Paul] A nicer colour.

621
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] You see the lamination.

622
00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It could've been longer in the oven.
-[Paul] Hmm.

623
00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Creamy ice cream.

624
00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Nice and creamy.
-[Prue] Pretty good.

625
00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Paul] Very dark.

626
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A bit of lamination on there.

627
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's burnt. You can taste it.

628
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The caramel went too far on both of them.
-[Paul] On both. Yeah, for sure.

629
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Moving on. This looks pale.

630
00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I like the way the fanning
of the pears have been done.

631
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good lamination.

632
00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:16.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mm.

633
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not much taste of caramel.
It wasn't taken far enough.

634
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ironically, it's all in the ice cream.
-Ice cream's lovely.

635
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I like the colour of this one,
but is it too much?

636
00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] A bit of lamination
but it's not the best.

637
00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] No. Like a shortcrust.

638
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not sure about that.
Not getting great flavours.

639
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Moving on. This looks quite doughy.

640
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it had a bit longer
perhaps in the oven for this.

641
00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Caramel needs to be bit darker.

642
00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pastry needs another five minutes.
But it's very pleasant.

643
00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Good ice cream.

644
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This looks a nice colour
and the pastry looks nice and crisp.

645
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the way…
It's been put to bed properly.

646

-[Paul] Lamination on the side.

647
00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hmm.
-[Prue] Both flavours are great.

648
00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's very nice ice cream.
Very good flavour.

649
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

650
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't mind it catching.
-[Prue] Don't mind at all.

651
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

652
00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's got a lovely flavour.
A lovely caramel flavour.

653
00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's lovely as well.
It's nice and creamy.

654
00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] This is quite a success this one.

655
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Quite nice.
-[Prue] Lovely.

656
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] This looks a bit pale.

657
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very pale.

658
00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Really doughy middle.
-[Paul] Hmm.

659
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

660
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Definitely underbaked. The caramel
flavour's not bad, but it's underbaked.

661
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I like the ice cream.

663
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In ninth place, we have this one.

664
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Andy, both the caramels went too far.

665
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So they're a bit bitter and overbaked.

666
00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Gill. [sighs] It's too bitter.
Far too bitter and too thin.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

we've got this one.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Christiaan, you had the caramel balance
perfect with the ice cream

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you're the winner.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

a sticky toffee pudding.

is a little bit too thick.

[Paul] It's a great festive cake.
It does look like a Christmas cake.

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

If I was buying this in a shop
and I asked for a mousse cake,

1141
00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd think "Where's the mousse?"

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A mousse cake has to be
half mousse at least.

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It would've been nice to have
something to finish off round the outside.

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It reminds me of tiramisu,
and for that it's sort of okay.

Well, it certainly looks very professional
and eye-catching, I'd say.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because it's small, it's made more impact.

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it was bigger and you kept
the same thickness, it would've been fine.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
His showstopper was amazing, but cracked.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So he's nearly there,

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:58.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I would still put him in line
for Star Baker along with Georgie

1214
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because Georgie won the technical

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and did well
with those little peanut fingers.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, at the moment, I would say in line
for Star Baker is either Dylan or Georgie.

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Shut up.

[Mike] Oh, well done.

1236
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By a thread, probably.

1237
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unfortunately, that leaves me
with the real horrible job.

1238
00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This was very close as well.

But the person
who's leaving us this week is…

1240
00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mike.

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispers] Sorry.

[Mike] I feel it was my time to go.

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just this little farmer
who does some baking in the kitchen

1245
00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and everyone else is incredible.

1246
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel like the quality

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of what everyone else is doing
is just breathtaking.

1248
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I'm just gonna miss everyone.

1250
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I never wanna bake again.
I'll miss you guys, that's why I'm sad.

One thing my mum said to me was,
"Don't cry." [laughs]

-Bit better next week.

1254
00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, hopefully.

1255
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm really happy,
but sad at the same time.

Mike was genuinely the heart of the group.
He's a good friend as well.

1257
00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Mike] You can bake things
that I couldn't even dream of.

1258
00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was really close
between Sumayah and Mike.

1259
00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And Sumayah just pipped him
on two of the three challenges.

1260
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:08.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a shame.

1261
00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:12.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's a great guy and a fantastic baker.
I look forward to visiting his farm shop.

[Sumayah] Georgie, well done. Well done.

1263
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Christiaan] So good.

Star Baker's just crazy.

1265
00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't think I was gonna do it,
but it does mean a lot.

1266
00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've always been self-conscious
about my baking.

1267
00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Need to get more confidence in myself,
and it just shows I can do it.
