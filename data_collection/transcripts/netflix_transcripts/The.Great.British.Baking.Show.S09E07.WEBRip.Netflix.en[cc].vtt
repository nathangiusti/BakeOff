about caramel week.

-[Jürgen] Caramel is heated sugar

32
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

34
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just sugar
and then suddenly, bam, it's caramel.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

41
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now you can create
any style of tart you like,

43
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But remember,
caramel must be the star of the show.

Years ago,
I auditioned for a part in <i>The Bill,</i>

48
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can kind of see it from both sides.

It's a caramel tart,
and it's a highly decorative caramel tart

52
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

put your own spin on.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And not a lot of time to do it.
-It's caramel, innit?

54
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need to be patient.
'Cause when you rush it, things mess up.

55
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

56
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't be trusted with molten sugar.
It's just a terrifying week.

[Paul] What we're looking for

58
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is a beautiful, thin base,
a beautifully set caramel,

59
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
flavours which enhance the caramel
with a gorgeous decoration on top.

60
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Caramel has to be the star.

61
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We don't want so much
that it's overbearingly sweet.

62
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It mustn't be rock-hard, like a toffee.

63
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it mustn't be runny like a sauce.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Get that chilled and then I can
focus on all the fillings and stuff.

66
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's so important that they get
the caramel base cold

67
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
before they decorate it.

68
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they don't cool, if you put anything
on the top, it will just melt.

69
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think the bakers
will be nervous about caramel week.

70
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

that much with it.

71
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's pure sugar.

72
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Erm, like <i>Titanic,</i>
it was a disaster movie.

308
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cream melted.

309
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-[Prue] It does look rough and ready.

310
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the piping that you've lost.
Probably with the heat from underneath it.

311
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's one crispy base.
-[cracking]

312
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

313
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you might not
have managed the finesse.

314
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flavour is delicious.
And it's definitely a caramel tart.

315
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think if you could have just had time

316
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to finish it properly,
you'd have a little triumph here.

317
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks for the lifeboat anyway.

318
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll throw a life jacket as well.

319
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The caramel
is absolutely delicious with that base.

320
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a shame it looks like that.

321
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still, I love it. Finesse, it's not.

322
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the look of it.
The pipework's good.

323
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the sides look neat.
Good colour as well.

324
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So far, so good.
-[sighs] Good God.

325
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm.

326
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Quite treacly. The caramel.
So, it's slightly bitter.

327
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But having said that,
because you've got the apple

328
00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the nuts and the cream,
it balances it out.

329
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] I think it's lovely.
-[Paul] Good job.

330
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Looks lovely.
-It's very neat.

331
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Yeah,
it's good decoration on top of that.

332
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Thank you.

333
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Chigs, it's too strong for me.
-[Paul] Yeah.

334
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Too heavy on the chocolate,
almost too much caramel.

335
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I know it's a caramel tart.
-[Chigs] Right.

336
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The caramel is too dark.
-[Chigs] Okay.

337
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The ginger is coming through,
it's delicate,

338
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the pastry's a little bit thick.

339
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've taken
the caramel a little too far.

340
00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, fair enough.

341
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's beautiful, very thin.
And I love the hazelnuts.

342
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] That pastry is so crisp.
The caramel is a little liquid.

343
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Funnily enough, though it's quite liquid,
the textures are wonderful.

344
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think it's overall a little too sweet.
-Right.

345
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We wanted caramel to be the hero flavour.
It's not. It's the hazelnut.

346
00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

347
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There have been issues with cooling.

348
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a pity, because we did ask
for a beautifully decorated tart.

349
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, the first thing
you see about that is the split.

350
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul chuckles]

351
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gonna rip
every tooth that was in my head.

352
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What you made is nut toffee.

353
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's too chewy.
-[Prue] Not your best, Jürgen.

354
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Great flavour.
-Thank you.

355
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But not quite what we asked for.

356
00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks like global warming in the Arctic.

357
00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[George] Cooling time didn't work out.
-[Prue chuckles]

358
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is very nice thin crust.

359
00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Custard looks
as if it's just curdled a little bit.

360
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The custard's definitely curdled,
and that caramel,

361
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause it's on the warm custard,
it just remains liquid.

362
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not getting a huge amount of flavour,
which is annoying.

363
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The glory of caramel custard
is the smoothness.

364
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once you curdle it, you've lost
the thing that it's famous for.

365
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I like the base.
-It's all about the base.

366
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue chuckles]

367
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thanks very much.

368
00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I like it all. And I like you.
-Thanks, that means a lot.

369
00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[George] I knew the custard was curdled.
I could see it.

370
00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Couldn't really get the flavours as well.
So, not a good morning at all.

371
00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[indistinct chattering]
-[Lizzie] No finesse, again.

372
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flavour, no finesse.

373
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is no doubt that the judges
have stepped up a gear.

374
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a sign
that the competition is getting serious.

375
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[thunder rumbling]

[Noel] <i>The bakers were able</i>

377
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

378
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello, bakers.

379
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Today your Technical Challenge
has been set for you by Paul.

380
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, any words of advice?

381
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You'll recognise this recipe,
and it's pretty straightforward.

382
00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, we expect perfection and not excuses.

383
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, as ever, the Technical Challenge
will be judged blind.

384
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're gonna have to ask
these two to skip out of the tent.

385
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Off you pop.

386
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're actually going
bra shopping for Paul.

387
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's nice they can do that together.
-It's nice, isn't it?

388
00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For your Technical Challenge today,
Paul would love you to make ten identical

389
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
caramel biscuit bars.

390
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Each biscuit bar should consist
of a crumbly, buttery shortbread finger

391
00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
topped with thick caramel
and coated with chocolate.

392
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have an hour and a half.
Doesn't sound long enough.

393
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks…
-Get set…

394
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake!

395
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] The recipe looks sparse.
This is all we have.

396
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's it.

397
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think we all know
what this is, secretly.

398
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a family favourite,
but I don't do well with those.

399
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never attempted
to make the recipe.

400
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The shop-bought thing
is perfect as it can be.

401
00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckling] So what's the use of it?

402
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're looking for ten identical
chocolate caramel shortbread biscuits.

403
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got shortbread caramel on the top

404
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and you cover it in chocolate.
-Perfect.

405
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Making a shortbread,
the clue is in the name: short.

406
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you've got to add everything together,
but not overmix it.

407
00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you fold it that extra bit,
it goes like rubber.

408
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The caramel has to be just on the top.
Not going down the sides.

[Paul] Traditionally, it's on top.

410
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got to allow the caramel
to set to a point.

411
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You go too high,

412
00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-it'll set like toffee.
-[Prue] Toffee.

413
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] If you do too less,
it will just run off.

414
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm.
-[Paul] It's delicious.

415
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The caramel is soft but not hard.

416
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got a bit of substance to it.

417
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you ever tried it in tea?
-[Prue] Not with chocolate on it.

418
00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

419
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The first line is,
"Make the shortbread dough."

420
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's it.

421
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I've got the caster sugar, butter.
I'm gonna put my egg in.

422
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just mixing my flour in by hand.

423
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want the shortbread
to be snappy, buttery and crumbly.

424
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You get better control
if you do it by hand.

425
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exclaims] Right. Come on!

426
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you eat biscuits
like the one you're making?

427
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sometimes. Yeah. If I want, like,
a sugary pick-me-up.

428
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A sugary pick-me-up
would be a good slogan for this.

429
00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Should we do an advert?

430
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When you want a sugary pick-me-up,

431
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[hesitating] have one of these shortbread

432
00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
crumbly fingers. With caramel
on top and chocolate coating

433
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that we can't name,
but you know what they are.

434
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You see them in shops
in golden wrappers.

435
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

436
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] That's should be good.

437
00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Roll the dough into a rectangle

438
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The thickness of the dough
should be pretty consistent.

439
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lizzie] It's a bit sticky actually.

440
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I just press it in
to make the tin shape.

441
00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And now, we're gonna put me dough
in the freezer to chill.

442
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[timer beeping]
-Gonna put it in for five minutes.

443
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's see what happens.

444
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're just gonna sum up the bakers
in a very concise way.

445
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Al Pacino, if he was on
the <i>Guess Who?</i> board.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Lumberjack Robert De Niro serial killer.
-Wow. [chuckling]

448
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The main puppet in the <i>Labyrinth.</i>

449
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mixed with <i>League of Gentlemen.</i>

450
00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Princess Leia, dressed as
a children's bullfighter.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-Wow!

452
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never come here again.

453
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel laughs]
-That's it.

454
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] That's it. My work's done.
-[laughs]

455
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] They all hate me now.

456
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lizzie] That's chilled
for about 15 minutes.

457
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Next step is bake.

458
00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going in.
So I'll check after 15 minutes.

459
00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. I'm going to set it
for ten minutes, initially.

460
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Twelve minutes to start off with.

461
00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

462
00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Hi, Giuseppe.
Me and Matt are a bit overworked.

463
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We're a bit tired today so…
-Aww!

464
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe you could do the time?

465
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can you do it in Italian?
-Yeah, which one?

466
00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That we're halfway through.

467
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[speaking Italian]

468
00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

469
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna move on, I think.
Make the caramel.

470
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The dreaded caramel.

471
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The hard stuff.

472
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm looking for amber, but not too dark.

473
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not happy with that colour.

474
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're getting there.
I want it to be a full-bodied caramel.

475
00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like a nice glass
of red wine. [laughs]

476
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, what I'm gonna do is add the cream.

477
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna start doing some funny business,
fog up me glasses.

478
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thinking to add the butter now.
It needs to get harder.

479
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] Lovely.
I'm going to take that off.

480
00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's too hot,
it then turns into toffee

481
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and Paul's teeth will fall out
when he eats it.

482
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[George] Just a bit worried
about my caramel.

483
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't know if I've done the right thing.

484
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] Just checking it.

485
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, a couple more minutes. [grunts]

486
00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Two more minutes.
I don't want undercooked biscuits.

487
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[timer beeping]

488
00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Think this is ready now.
It's getting a nice

489
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
golden colour.

490
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is definitely the colour
of shortbread.

491
00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] That should be it.

492
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Starting to get a bit darker at the edges.

493
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That looks good.

494
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just want it
to cool down a little so I can cut it.

495
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] If they want perfection,
they should be exactly the same size.

496
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which is not gonna be easy
'cause this is 18 centimetres.

497
00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I have to cut them at
one point eight centimetres each.

498
00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hope that just broke
in the right place.

499
00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

500
00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That did not break
in the right place. [sighs heavily]

501
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

502
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna have to just try
and pipe the caramel.

503
00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The caramel needs to be
liquid enough to be pipeable,

504
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but stiff enough to stay up.

505
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just about the right consistency.

506
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[George] Mine won't come through.

507
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not pipeable.
I'm gonna try and soften it up again.

508
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] Oh, this is definitely
of pipeable consistency.

509
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lizzie] No finesse again.
Just got to roll with it.

510
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[George] Let's see if that works.

511
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Crystelle] I'm running out of caramel.

512
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your Showstopper challenge.

618
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The judges would like you to create

619
00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a visually spectacular
caramel-flavoured dessert,

620
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
complete with an exquisite
sugar-work dome or sphere.

621
00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] The style of dessert
is entirely up to you,

622
00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it must have at least one baked
element and two caramel components.

623
00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have four and a half hours.

624
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Enough time to attract every donkey,
fly and wasp in the vicinity.

625
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] On your marks…
-[Noel] Get set…

626
00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

627
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here we go. Here we go.

628
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sugar dome is going to be
the headache of the whole thing.

629
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

630
00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Highly decorated Showstoppers
for me are the best thing,

631
00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the fact
that it's married up with caramel,

632
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
this should taste and look amazing.

633
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just to make it more difficult,
we've asked them to encase the whole thing

634
00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in a dome of sugar.

635
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Who would ever, in their spare time,
make a sugar dome?

636
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a specialist skill which you don't
really expect most bakers to have.

637
00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But of course, these are great bakers.

638
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We do expect them
to be able to work with sugar.

639
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sticky, sticky.

640
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Traditionally, it'd be made
with caramelised sugar,

641
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they can use isomalt
which is actually more stable.

642
00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The most important thing
is you should be able to see through it.

643
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thinner and the clearer, the better.

644
00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not expecting failures.

645
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

648
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mine is called "The Caramel Mistake,"
because every time I made it,

649
00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, my sugar dome, I went through
two kilos of sugar at home

651
00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and I couldn't get one out.
-How many times did you do it?

652
00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it was sixteen times in total.

653
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then I learned
about this lovely stuff.

654
00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-It's isomalt, worked first time.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Desperately trying
not to make a weird joke about that.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I call this the "Caramel Mistake"?

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

842
00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] Now it all comes to life

844
00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

927
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think we're gonna
have to just pop it, aren't we?

928
00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lizzie] Just cut the bottom.
Can't get water on the thing.

941
00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was like watching Charlie Chaplin.

I'll just put it in this sticky bowl."

944
00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you will be relieved

945
00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've gotta leave it… You've gotta do.

948
00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Group heart attacks, everyone?

949
00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

950
00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] <i>It's judgment time</i>

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

952
00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Crystelle, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?

953
00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened to the bowl?

954
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was a bit of
a last-minute rush at the end.

955
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I ended up going with the balloon method

956
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I did it while it was quite warm.
It was gonna be bigger.

957
00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the look of the chocolate.
You got a lovely glaze on that chocolate.

958
00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That looks lovely.
-[Prue] That's very beautiful.

959
00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the flavour.

960
00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sort of salted caramel chew.
-The biscuit layer is okay.

961
00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chocolate layer on the top's
just too thick.

962
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And your mousse is quite dry.

963
00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A mousse should be
like bubbles on the mouth.

964
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's quite stodgy. Gelatin?
-Yeah.

965
00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Too much.
-It's a bit too much. Look, it's gluey.

966
00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So overall, I quite like the flavour,
even though it is rich.

967
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You couldn't eat a lot of that,
but it looks lovely.

968
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. I'll take that.

969
00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jürgen, I think it looks
most spectacular.

970
00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the sponge fingers.

971
00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The isomalt looks really thick.

972
00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got quite a heavy collar here,
but the dome itself looks beautiful

973
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause it's absolutely crystal-clear.

974
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Love the flower in the front.
-[Prue] Looks really good.

975
00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Oh!

976
00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, you are a piece of work.

977
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Cut into it.
-[Matt] Oh, look at that.

978
00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Gosh, that looks beautiful.

979
00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wow.
-[Matt] Wow!

980
00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That looks so lovely

981
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the bavarois
are the same thickness.

982
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The caramel at the bottom
and the pastry is really thin.

983
00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's delicious.

984
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Absolutely. Every layer
from the shortbread to the bavarois,

985
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
all the way to the top.

986
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The passion fruit.

987
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The praline, the lady's fingers.
The whole thing's beautiful.

988

-It's nice to have you back in the tent.
-Thank you very much.

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Jürgen, it's an absolute triumph.
-Thank you.

990
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can't resist another.
-[Paul] Well done, thank you very much.

991
00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Well done.
-Smashed it.

992
00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Lovely shaped dome. Very misty.
-Yeah.

993
00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Looks like
a greenhouse in the winter.

994
00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

995
00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Apart from that,
it's very elegant and neat.

996
00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Oh, come on.

997
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all exclaiming]

998
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-There's so much caramel.
-[Prue] Certainly tastes of caramel.

999
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, it's not too much.

1000
00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Something's slightly wrong
about the textures.

1001
00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The glueiness of the glaze
is a little unpleasant.

1002
00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Your mousse is all wrong,
it's like a wallpaper paste.

1003
00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's heavy and stodgy and dry.
The glaze is too gluey.

1004
00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Put gelatin in there?
-I did. Yes.

1005
00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Probably a bit too much.

1006
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
However, it does taste lovely.

1007
00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Looks a mess, doesn't it?
-[Chigs] Yeah.

1008
00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've had a bit of leakage
and nothing's set.

1009
00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Doesn't look the right colour.
-[Chigs] No.

1010
00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's too light.
The isomalt's too misty.

1011
00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a shame 'cause you can't see
the chocolate work inside.

1012
00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's take it off.

1013
00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I mean, that looks a lot better already.
-[all chuckle]

1014
00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Ooh, look at that.
-[Prue] Thank you.

1015
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the even layers. Really nice.

1016
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The caramel wasn't taken
as far as it could've been,

1017
00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is why it's poured out.
Your dacquoise is nice.

1018
00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It works with the coffee flavour.

1019
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the flavour
is absolutely delicious, Chigs.

1020
00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Definite caramel, chocolate is just there.
The praline is delicious.

1021
00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just all a bit liquid.

1022
00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's such a pity
'cause it's so nearly perfect.

1023
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Thank you, Chigs.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] Cheers, guys, thank you.

1025
00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, straight off the cuff
it looks amazing.

1026
00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:49.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like what you've done with that dome,
considering it's made from sugar.

1027
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's difficult.
It's a nice-looking cake.

1028
00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-George, I think it's beautiful.
-Thank you.

1029
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] This is gonna be
difficult in sugar.

1030
00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, perfect.
-[Prue] Perfect.

1031
00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Boom.

1032
00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[groans]
-[Prue chuckles]

1033
00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:07.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Wow!
-[Noel] Mmm-hmm.

1034
00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I could eat a lot of that, George.
-[sighs]

1035
00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a little too dry for me.

1036
00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got dry chocolate ganache,
dry dacquoise,

1037
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then you got a little thin layer
of buttercream,

1038
00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then you have dacquoise again.

1039
00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needed a mousse or a bavarois
rather than just buttercream.

1040
00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The taste is nice, but the textures,
for me, are too dry on the mouth.

1041
00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I know what you mean,

1042
00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I actually think that if you get
a mouthful of everything, it's delicious.

1043
00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I think you've done a really good job.

1044
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much, George.
-Thank you.

1045
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispering] Well done, George.

1046
00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it looks amazing.

1047
00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As always with your bakes,
it's surprising and witty.

1048
00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I like it.
-We asked for finesse.

1049
00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think we've got it.

1050
00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've done an upside down dome,
which is unusual and brave.

1051
00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look, shall we?

1052
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] How am I gonna do this?

1053
00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think I'm gonna need a spoon.
-[laughs]

1054
00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have never had sage caramel before.

1055
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What do you think?
-The flavour's very strong.

1056
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To be very honest, Lizzie,
it doesn't look great inside there.

1057
00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a bit rough and ready.
-[Paul] It's just like a trifle.

1058
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got literally just a mess
of everything going on.

1059
00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've mashed it with the flowers.

1060
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Funnily enough,
Paul says it's like a trifle.

1061
00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It would be better
if it had a ton of custard in it,

1062
00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because it's quite stodgy.

1063
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The roses are not great to eat,
and it's very sweet.

1064
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never had anything like it before.

1065
00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] I think it's very brave.
-Yeah, very brave.

1066
00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks, Lizzie.
-Ta.

1067
00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Finesse.
-Finesse.

1068
00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The tables have turned,
so now I'm all style and no substance.

1069
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He likes the flavours.
He loved the way it looked.

1070
00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He just thought it was a bit dry.

1071
00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whether it's enough, I don't know.

1072
00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know who's gonna go home,
or who's gonna get Star Baker.

1073
00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I think we're
all pretty on edge, actually.

1074
00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Definitely think
this is the tightest week. 100%.

1075
00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:29.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I think that the bakers will be glad
to see the back of caramel week.

1076
00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's been really good in parts.
-Nice to see Jürgen come back.

1077
00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the one that deserves a little pat
on the back was George for using sugar.

1078
00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] He could've come in today
and said, "I'm beaten,"

1079
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but he came in
and really did himself proud.

1080
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it enough to save him?

1081
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And Lizzie, I have to say,
has not done herself proud.

1082
00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The whole thing was sort of inedible.

1083
00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Does this mean Lizzie
is near the bottom now?

1084
00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's her or George isn't it?

1085
00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
George has been struggling over the first
two challenges. He's built himself up.

1086
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And Lizzie's sort of dropped down.
Don't think he's on his own anymore.

1087
00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was a little bit upset
about Giuseppe's as well.

1088
00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was really gelatinous.

1089
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's still got a good chance
of being Star Baker

1090
00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause he did do so well
in the other two.

1091
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Crystelle is in line
for Star Baker

1092
00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause she had not had a bad week.

1093
00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jürgen's had a pretty good week.

1094
00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He did come second in the Technical,
and I think he's done really well today.

1095
00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] So let's talk about Chigs.

1096
00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought he did very well
in his Chignature.

1097
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Chigs got better every challenge
from Signature through to Showstopper.

1098
00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At the end of the day,
I think you've got two people in trouble

1099
00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the other four in line for Star Baker.

1100
00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well done, bakers.
That was a tricky week. Caramel.

1101
00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I've got the amazing job of announcing
who is Star Baker this week.

1102
00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the person
who's Star Baker this week is…

1103
00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jürgen.

1104
00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all clapping]

1105
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're back, Jürgy-pops,
you're back.

1106
00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Jürgy-Popsy back.
-[all laugh]

1107
00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I have the unenviable task
of telling you who's going home

1108
00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and what I will say is that
it was really close this week.

1109
00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could have been one of two people.

1110
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The person who's going is someone
we've all grown very close to

1111
00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and we're all gonna miss a lot.

1112
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm afraid that the person
going home this week is…

1113
00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
George.

1114
00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Crystelle murmurs]
-It's all right, guys.

1115
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is bittersweet to it.

1116
00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My Showstopper, I was proud of.

1117
00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] I just think you ran out of steam.
-Yeah, I know.

1118
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is very sad to see George go.

1119
00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, unfortunately, George
made more mistakes than Lizzie did.

1120
00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Speaking to my family,
they're just so proud

1121
00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that I've managed to kind of
even get in the tent.

1122
00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, yeah, week seven. I'm fine with that.

1123
00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, Jürgen. Well done.

1124
00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought actually Jürgen did enough
