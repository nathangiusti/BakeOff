64
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you need to show the bread who's boss.

is something original,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it's got to be good bread.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
compared with the porcini mushrooms.

511
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because you've got the liquid
from the mushrooms going into the dough,

512
00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you've also got just the right amount
of truffle oil,

513
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it blends really nicely together.

514
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a decent roll.

515
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Absolutely lovely.
-Well done.

516
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-We're having a lovely day.

517
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah, we are? [laughs]

518
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] They look really interesting.
I love the colour.

519
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I really like the colour
and I really like the shape.

520
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wish I got a better ear.
I'm not happy with that.

521
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That's lovely.

522
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Yeah.
-It's a really nice look to them.

523
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-Let's have a look.

524
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Still never tried this flavouring
you put in it.

525
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Dylan] Gochujang.
-[Prue] It's mostly chilli?

526
00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's like a fermented chilli paste.
-[Paul] It's amazing.

527
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The spice levels in that are delicious.

528
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I love the garlic.

529
00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not particularly strong,
but it's there.

530
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What impressed me more than anything else

531
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is that the crust that you've managed
to achieve on such an enriched dough

532
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the colour and the flavour
is so much in your face…

533
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-My goodness.
-[all applaud and cheer]

535
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

536
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never had anything like it.

537
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah?
-That's why you got the handshake.

538
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You could probably sell a lot of them.
-[laughs]

539
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But they're lovely. I really like…

540
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I haven't been surprised by a flavour
for a long time.

541
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done, Dylan.
-[chuckles] Cheers.

542
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He looks positively staggered.

543
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[laughs]

544
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done, mate.
-[Prue] Very good work.

545
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got a handshake, which is insane.

546
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love travelling
so I can pick up flavours.

547
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And for it all just being acknowledged
right there,

548
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that was wild, like really wild.

549
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] So I've had
the first Paul pat, so I'm…

550
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles] I can't even speak,
I'm just so happy.

551
00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighing] Oh, God.

552
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yay!

553
00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm disappointed, of course,
but going into the technical,

554
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got to pull it out the bag
to bring myself up there,

555
00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause everyone is amazing.

556
00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone's bakes look incredible,
and had really good feedback.

557
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm at the bottom of the pile, really.

558

[Alison] <i>The bakers were able</i>
<i>to practise their buns,</i>

561
00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>but they have no idea what's in store</i>
<i>for them in the technical challenge.</i>

562
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dylan] What is that?

563
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Illiyin] Some type of demonstration,
I'm telling you.

564
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, is it going to be watch…
watch and make?

565
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That would be so cool, if it is.
-[Illiyin] Who's going to be doing it?

566
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Dylan] It may be Paul.
-He's not even got an apron on. No way.

567
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Welcome back, bakers.

568
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now your technical challenge has been set
by Dr Denim himself, Paul Hollywood.

569
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dr Denim would love you to make
a seven-strand plaited wreath.

570
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] Now, this is a bit
of an unusual technical,

571
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause Paul has given you no instructions
on how to shape your bread.

572
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But he's not a complete monster.

573
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's gonna do a demonstration
for you instead.

574
00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want all of you to come forward.
Come on.

575
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No way. That's sick.
-Not too fast. We don't want to spook him.

576
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've done a nine-strand,
never a seven-strand.

577
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay.

578
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You start off with seven strands,
four on one side, three on another.

579
00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You work from the outside in.

580
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you're in, this now has four,

581
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then over to the middle,
this has four.

582
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's out, in, all the way down,
until you get down to the bottom

583
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And then you invert it.
-Oh.

584
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then you work exactly the same.
Go over.

585
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All the way down to the bottom.

586
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then all you do is trim off the ends.

587
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you want to join
the two pieces together.

588
00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A little pinch.

589
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's it.

590
00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

591
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Here's a handshake.
-[all laugh]

592
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As ever, this will be judged blind.

593
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we'll ask our lovely judges
to leave the tent.

594
00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Good luck.
-Off you pop.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And now you guys just have to remember
what Paul Hollywood did and recreate it

-You've got two hours and 30 minutes.
-On your marks.

599
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get set.

602
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-God.
-[Christiaan] This is crazy.

603
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we've got the full ingredient list,
but no method.

604
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Gill] So it's 500 grammes
of strong bread flour,

605
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a sachet of fast-action yeast,
salt, bit of olive oil,

606
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and he's given us a bit of leeway
on the water.

607
00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have done stranded,
plaited loaves before.

608
00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But with a picture in front.
I'm not too good at memory games.

609
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have little bit experience with plaits.
Brioche we do like this in my country.

610
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So we can make some Slovakian style.

611
00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul, it was such a pleasure
seeing you plaiting a loaf.

612
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And what's so beautiful about this

[Paul] Yeah, you can see
each and every plait.

614
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If the dough is too soft,
then you lose all definition in the plait.

615
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We also asked for the hole in the middle.

616
00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to get the strands
a decent length.

617
00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the other thing that is difficult

618
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is to know exactly when
something has proved enough.

619
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sometimes if you under-prove, the yeast
hasn't reached its full potential.

620
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When it goes into the oven,
the bread expands quickly

621
00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it's gonna rip and look terrible.

622
00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Would you like some, Prue?
-Yeah.

623
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a cut.

624
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-There you go.
-Doesn't that look lovely?

626
00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This should have the light crust outside
and the slight chewiness on the inside.

627
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
God, it's gorgeous. I want to kiss it.

628
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yeah.

629
00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So now I'm just kneading my dough.
The key is just keep working it.

632
00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's no mixer,
and I am sporting a middle age injury

633

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So apologies to Jenina,
my physiotherapist.

635
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm getting a sweat on now,

636
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I wanna do well
'cause I didn't have the best morning.

637
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The dough's ready. I'll get a bowl
and put it in the proving drawer.

638
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I assume it's gonna be
until it doubles in size.

639

640
00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna get ready for the egg wash.

641
00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I only got given one egg.

642
00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, shoot.

643
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've put the egg in the bloody thing.
I have to do it again.

644
00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yeah.

645
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

646
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The glaze… [chuckles] is the egg,
and I stuck it in it.

647
00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did wonder why there was an egg in it.

648
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] I'll practice doing the plait
with the cling film.

649
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a smart idea.
Did you get a handshake?

650
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-You know what happens?

651
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He shakes your hand,
puts a microchip into it.

652
00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll faint
and then wake up outside his house.

653

654
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll be running errands for him.
It's how he got me to do this show.

655
00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Andy's really going for that bread.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

661
00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right, let's just do this.
It looks all right.

662
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's doubled in size from when I started.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Gill] I'm splitting it
to make seven strands.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it should be quite long,
the strands, not small.

[Georgie] When you plait, it gets shorter.

we start at the halfway point,

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fingers crossed really.
I'm playing catch-up with these guys.

718
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just gonna have a peep.
It's proving well.

719
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I think, stay in there for longer.

720
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] That proved so quick.
Fifteen minutes.

721
00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, it's got a bit of a spring.
-It is rising.

722
00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna leave it five more minutes.

723
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really important you prove it enough
a second time.

724
00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Otherwise it expands too much
when it goes in the oven,

725
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it can crack when it rises.

726
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Mike] Right, it's going in.
Good luck, Plaity.

727
00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Christiaan] I hope it puffs up more.
-How's the prove? Did you check?

728
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just put it in.

729
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[beep]

730
00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers! You've got half an hour left.

731
00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll have to bang that up.
This'll be beg, borrow and steal on time.

732
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is springing back rather nicely,
so egg wash time.

733
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just annoyed with the shape of mine.
It's lost the plait there.

734
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay, shove it in.
-[Nelly] Let's do this.

735
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sumayah] Now we just wait.

736
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Peekaboo.

737
00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh!

738
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Georgie] How's he doing that?

739
00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Andy, Georgie just said,
"How's he doing that?"

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Magic man, me, I tell you. [laughs]

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Mm.

743
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Nelly] It's proved well.

744
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Considering it could've been
a hell of a lot worse.

745
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you've got ten minutes left.

746
00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Christiaan] I think I'm coming out.

747
00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just looks a mess. I don't know how crusty
they wanted the outside.

748
00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just wanna give it another glaze.
Bit of shine, something to elevate it.

749
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's looking okay,
but I'm gonna give it a little bit longer.

750
00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd rather it be fully baked
than underbaked.

751
00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks all right,
but it lost definition.

752
00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

754
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They always says lift it up
and knock on the bottom.

755
00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's dull. Should be done.

756
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

what I'm meant to be listening for.

757
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gill, how have you got your egg wash
so beautiful?

758
00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was precision egg washing, that.

759
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've got a nice wreath.
-Don't touch it.

760
00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bakers, you have one minute left.
-I'm going.

762
00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's moulded into one,
but it's a wreath, 'cause there's a hole.

763
00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My plait isn't the best,
but it's got a glaze, it's shiny.

764
00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:44.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's nice round here, then it loses a bit.
But to be honest, compared to how it was…

765
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up.

766
00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles] Get off the paper.

767
00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please bring your wreaths up
and place them behind your photos.

that was right. It's not even round.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I would like him to say it's tidy.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll start with this one.

782
00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

fancy-looking cottage loaf.

786
00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. But it's baked.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

788
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got good glaze
and a hole in the middle.

789
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

790
00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

795
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

803
00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needed more proving.
That would've opened it up.

1262
00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1269
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's a good amount of olives.

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

The standard that he took it to
