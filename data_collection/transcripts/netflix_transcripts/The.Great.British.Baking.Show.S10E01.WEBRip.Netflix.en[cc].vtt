00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've got too much in it, which
will pull all the moisture from the cake.

509
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it's very dry.

510
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

511
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-[Prue] They don't look great, do they?
-No.

512
00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] They're falling apart.
-I cut it when it was warm…

513
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, fatal.
-…so it started crumbling a bit.

514
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The sponge is delicious
and the Swiss meringue is lovely.

515
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could have been sharper,
could've had more raspberry.

516
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think there's anything wrong
with the flavours. It just looks a mess.

517
00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] <i>They look amazing.</i>

518
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I love the colour,
I love the pot, the soil.

519
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks.
-[Paul] Just hope the inside

520
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

521
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, that is really clever
to get all that in there.

522
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The red wine ganache works
beautifully well with the raspberry.

524
00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh!

525
00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's rich and indulgent.

527
00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
At first glance, you think,
"Absolutely delightful."

528
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you look closely,
there are a few problems.

529
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're a bit wibbly.

530
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The tamarind works really well.
Coconut works beautifully well with it.

531
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Overall, it's a really nice cake.
-[Prue] And it's original.

532
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Abdul, I think it looks
absolutely delicious.

536
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's almost an illusion, which I like.
It looks like a garden.

537
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm! It's very light.

538
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Little kick of chilli.
You get a little acidity.

539
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the raspberry in there
is a beautiful flavour.

540

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm impressed.

they're vibrant and in your face.

547

Mmm.

548
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The flavours
coming from the pandan,

549
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the caramel, and coconut is delicious.

550
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Such an interesting thing to do,
setting custard on top of a cake.

551
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Gooey and unctuous.
-[Prue] Not too sweet.

552
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Yeah.
-[Prue] Bomb time.

553
00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Can I nick a sugar bomb?
-Yes, feel free.

554
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's amazing.
-[Matt] It's not too sweet.

555
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was expecting it to be.
But you do get the burst of sugar.

556
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at me.
I'll have you two out of a job.

557

559
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I liked it.

560
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, that counts for nothing
but I liked it.

[Prue] <i>It looks like your caramel</i>

562
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you mean the caramel
to run right down the sides?

563
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. I spent ages trying to get the caramel
perfect, then it went… [giggles nervously]

564
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's enough coffee in there
to keep you awake at night.

565
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles] Yeah.

566
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

567
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The other flavours coming through
are not strong enough to compete with it.

568
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the ganache is too hard.

569
00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

575
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit bland.
There's ginger, but not enough.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a caramel undertone, but it's got
no hero, which is what you need.

577
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

580
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

585
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

587
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Because I think the booze is perfect.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So Paul would like you
to produce a red velvet cake.

Your all-American layered cake
should make a big impression

615
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

616
00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love impressions.
Matt's good at impressions.

617
00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In fact, he does an amazing Paul.

618
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go on, do your Paul.

619
00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're a good baker, you're a good baker,
you're a good baker, too. All right!

620
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Cover your eyes and
it's like he's back in the tent.

622
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uncanny. Your classic cake should consist
of six tender, moist, crimson red sponges

623
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
sandwiching a smooth, fluffy
cream cheese icing.

624
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sprinkled with red crumbs
to give it that red velvet finish.

625
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have two hours
until we defrost Paul and Prue.

626
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks.
-Get set.

627
00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake!

628
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, my first challenge
was a disaster, so I'm stressed.

629
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like anxiety.

[Matt] <i>In the technical challenge,</i>

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>the same basic recipe.</i>

632
00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is very sentimental.
This is the first cake I ever made.

633
00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] I normally do a red velvet cake.

634
00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the curse. You're like,
"I know how to do that,"

635
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then this is the one day you don't.

636
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never made one before.

637
00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Paul, red velvet cake
for our first technical.

638
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why did you go for that?

639
00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The advantage
is everybody will know it.

640
00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's quite a light chocolaty cake…
-Hmm.

641
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
…with the use of vinegar,
and buttermilk blended with bicarb.

642
00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's your rising agent.
And actually, there's the flavour.

643
00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has a very distinctive tang to it.

644
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, there's colouring to give it
that vibrant red inside.

645
00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Well…

646
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] We haven't told the bakers
how much food colouring.

647
00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Adding too much
makes the cake far too dark.

648
00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the proportion of cream cheese is
higher than in most sponges.

649
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. It's a big cake.

650
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We want height, so the thickness
of cream cheese is critical.

651
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's lovely.
-I can't wait to see

652
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
what they're gonna turn out.

653
00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What I'm not looking forward to
is trying 12 red velvet cakes.

654
00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're gonna have to stretcher me
out of there.

[Will] The first instruction is
"Make the red velvet batter."

656
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No hints as to how.

657
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
God. What do we do?

658
00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Luckily, I've got it all in here.

659
00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] I'm mixing my butter and sugar.

660
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's creaming up. That's what I want.

661
00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now I'm going to add the eggs,
buttermilk, flour, cocoa, and vinegar.

662
00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

What's that about?

663
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Dawn] You've got to add the bicarb
just before you put it in the oven,

671
00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I'm just gonna wing it.
There's not really a method.

673
00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

676
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does it mean light red?

677
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hers is a bit redder than yours.

679
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I-- Don't ask me.
I've got no clue what I'm doing.

680
00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

683
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It just says "bake", at your leisure.

Cream cheese
should be almost equal to the cake.

820
00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To keep that height.

821
00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tastes good.
Soft with a little bit of tartness.

822
00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Moving on to number two.
-Piping is good.

823
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] But the crumb on the outside,
it's too thick.

824
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour's all right.

825
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Certainly got the tang to it.

826
00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Right. Over here.

827
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This one's really attractive.
-[Paul] Hmm.

828
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think the cake
is slightly undercooked.

829
00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I also think there's quite
a lot of red in this one.

830
00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very red.

831
00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] You asked for crimson.

832
00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the wrong shade of crimson, Matt.
All right? Back off.

833
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughter]

834
00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, moving on. Not much height to it.

835
00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Needs to be a bit higher.

836
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And it's not very light.
-[Prue] It's solid.

837
00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's a little bit claggy.
Feels slightly underdone.

838
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Right.
-Now this is

839
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
almost the naked cake
around the outside, isn't it?

840
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very little cream cheese.

841
00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] But sponge is nicely risen.

842
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah.

843
00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sponge is light and tangy.

844
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] So we have this one.
This is quite original.

845
00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Decoration looks like a wedding hat.

846
00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't like that. Cream cheese should
have been put in the layers.

847
00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's why we've lost quite a bit
of height through that.

848
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sponge is all right.
-Hmm.

849
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sponge is all right.
Just not what we wanted.

850
00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Right. This one over here.

851
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's lost its definition.

852
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rather flat rosettes.

853
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But certainly got the tang to it.

854
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Hmm. Nice flavour.

855
00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Okay, moving on.
Could be a bit straighter.

856
00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yes, it's a bit on the lean.

857
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the sponge is all right.

858
00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You get that lightness.
-Hmm. This is a good cake.

859
00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This one's got much too much
crumb on the bottom.

860
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] It has.
-Decoration doesn't look great.

861
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sponge, it's actually not that bad.

862
00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just think I'd liked to have seen
that a bit neater throughout.

863
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Right. This one.

864
00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Big layers of sponge.

865
00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sponge is light.

866
00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But the rosettes
sank all over the place.

867
00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do hope that's as good on the inside
as it looks on the outside.

868
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Height of the cake is good.

869
00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Definition is perfect.
-This is what we were looking for

870
00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with the crumb, that light dusting.

871
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's gotta be good inside.

872
00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] This better be good inside.
-[chuckles]

873
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Nice layers.
-There is a lot of cream cheese there.

874
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that's very nice.

875
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's it.
-Should we go home now?

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay, moving on to this one.

878
00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A little bit too much on the crumb.

879
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

880
00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Kevin] Better than the red velvet cake.
A step in the right direction.

1248
00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1250
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1252
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What kind of showstopper is this?

1253
00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1254
00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1255
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rebs] It's not very neat, but it looks
like my house, which is a bonus.

1257
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just don't want to go home.

1259
00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rebs, would you like
to bring your showstopper up, please?

1260
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Kevin exclaims]

1261
00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rebs] Just one thing to get.

1262
00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know if you've ever been
to Northern Ireland,

1263
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it's constantly raining,

1264
00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so you have to have
a bit of coconut rum rain.

1265
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Rebs chuckles] I know.

1266
00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It does remind me of a very rural cottage.
It's very good.

1267
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] The detail's lovely.
-This is basically a piña colada cake?

1268
00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rebs] Yeah. Coconut and vanilla sponge,

1269
00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
pineapple curd
and flambéed pineapple slices

1270
00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with coconut and rum butter cream.

1271
00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm.

1272
00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the flavour.

1273
00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The pineapple
and coconut comes through.

1274
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is overbaked, the sponge, not by much,

1275
00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but overall, I think, A, it looks great,
B, the flavours came through beautifully.

1276
00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

The banana cake itself is delicious.

1287
00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My only thing is,

1288
00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
cut your pecans up more, they're too big.

1289
00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1291
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's beautifully neat Carole,

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I love the pots around the outside.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carole] That's coffee and walnut
with coffee butter cream.

1294
00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1298
00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never had a coffee cake
that strong before.

1299
00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nor me.
-Coffee's actually burning.

1300

-That's fascinating. Wow.

1301
00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've blown Paul's mind.

1302
00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] Lots of skill here,
you're very good at piping.

1303
00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] So much buttercream.
-[Prue chuckles]

1305
00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very claggy.

1306
00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Especially
the compressed middle layer.

1307
00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's the weight.
There's so much buttercream on there.

1308
00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sponge just can't hold it.

1309
00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It glues your mouth,
which might be a good thing for you now.

1310
00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the flavour's fantastic.

1311
00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
You obviously ran out of time,
the piping's a bit clumsy.

1312
00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Let's have a look. Hmm.
-[Prue] Ooh, wow.

1313
00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Never had a crumble
in a cake before.

1314
00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you've done a really good job.

1315
00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The crumble with the compote,
it's just fantastic.

1316
00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It works really well.

1317
00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt and Prue] Well done.
-Thank you. [laughs]

1318
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was so worried.

1319
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

1320
00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Boo!
-[gasps]

1321
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1322
00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:26.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] You've lost detail on the house.

1323
00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Abdul] Yes.
-You ran out of time?

1324
00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unfortunately, my oven wasn't hot,
which meant my cakes were delayed.

1325
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So that pushed everything.

1326
00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My sponge is masala chai,

1327
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and in between
I have mascarpone frosting and mango jam.

1328
00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chai's delicious,
carries really well inside the cake.

1329
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the bake's good too.

It's delicious,
but I would have liked more mango.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-I'd like more detail,

1332
00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because I think inside tastes great.

1333
01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It looks absolutely charming. I love it.

1334
01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the pebbledash.

1335
01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gone wonky,
but I'm thinking the house was wonky.

1336
01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Subsidence. Terrible subsidence.
-[Noel laughs]

1337
01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Wow.
-[Prue] Look at that.

1338
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's genoise sponge with apricot, praline,

1339
01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and vanilla German buttercream inside.

1340
01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] How many layers?
-Supposed to be 12.

1341
01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going to be really honest
and admit that there are 11.

1342
01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's really brave
to make genoise so airy

1343
01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that it could get squashed easily,
but it hasn't squashed at all.

1344
01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] That is a fantastic cake.
You've got texture from the praline.

1345
01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The apricot is lovely, with some tartness
to that, which really works.

1346
01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sponge is well baked,
the butter cream works well.

1347
01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] Well done.

1348
01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I like the whole look of it.
It's charming.

1349
01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The detail's lovely.

1350
01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This has got a lot
of interesting flavours, yeah?

1351
01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] It is milk tea sponge

1352
01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with strawberry jam
and matcha buttercream.

1353
01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Cuts nice.

1354
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your textures are beautiful.

1355
01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The baking element is perfect,
those sponges are delicious.

1356
01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My issue is, there's no hero flavour.

1357
01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's so many little things going on,
there's matcha,

1358
01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the strawberry, the tea flavour
is not strong enough.

1359
01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Oh, my God, I recognise that block now.

1360
01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Really?
-Yeah, we live near each other.

1361
01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's brilliant.

1362
01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] So good.

1363
01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] You've over baked every one.
-[groans]

1364
01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The chocolate
could have been more punchy.

1365
01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Love the orange,
but it comes down to the bake for me.

1366
01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's not perfectly decorated, is it?

1367
01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a little bit clumsy.

1368
01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Let's have a look.
-[Maisam] It's lemon,

1369
01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is inspired
by the lemon trees in that house.

1370
01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm.

1371
01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite dense.

1372
01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I actually love the flavour.

1373
01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It is just a bit puddingy.

1374
01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That in a bowl with custard,
I'd be in heaven.

1375
01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But this is supposed to be cake.
-[both laugh]

1376
01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like the flavour, texture's wrong.

1377
01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bit simple on the decoration.
-Yes.

1378
01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The decorations are quite sweet,

1379
01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I expected that to be
a lot more detailed than it is.

1380
01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just a little bit simplistic.

1381
01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But his grandparents
actually lived in a cake,

1382
01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it's actually very accurate.

1383
01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah.

1384
01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Wow!
-[Matt] Look at that.

1385
01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Well, there's
lots of strawberries and cream.

1386
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Doesn't bowl me over.

1387
01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-There's too much alcohol.
-[Prue] Do you know?

1388
01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Too much?
-I thought I'd never hear me say this,

1389
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but he's right.

1390
01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sponge is lovely and soft,

1391
01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but somehow,
if you put booze in a filling,

1392
01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's modified by the cake,
but if it's in the cake, it's everywhere.

1393
01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I love it for the colour and the vibrancy.

1394
01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

amazing job.

1395

1396
01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can see coming home to your mom's flat
must have been really good.

1397
01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] It is chocolate cake.

1398
01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It contains soy sauce.
-[Prue] For the umami?

1399
01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's correct. And inside,
Christmas-inspired buttercream.

1400
01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1401
01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just the right amount of spice,
very chocolatey.

1402
01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
