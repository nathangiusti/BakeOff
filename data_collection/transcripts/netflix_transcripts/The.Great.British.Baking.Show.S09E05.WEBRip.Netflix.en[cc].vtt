But it was not a surprise in this heat.

[Paul] Let's start with
the orange and strawberry, shall we?

314
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Really beautiful.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

316
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the spice that you've got in there,
it's just perfect. Right.

320
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

brown butter shortbread

327
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with pistachios and cardamom.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

It's quite unusual, too.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The second biscuits
are hazelnuts and orange zest

330
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with a chocolate hazelnut filling.

331
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So delicate, the orange. It's just right.

332
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The amount of chocolate is perfect.
You've got that chew in the middle.

333
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're really interesting.
Beautifully made.

[Chigs] So that's a vanilla shortbread

336
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with raspberry jam and a disk of marzipan.

337
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the bottom ones are purely marzipan
with some orange.

338
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Your textures are beautiful.

339
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The marzipan you get, but can't taste.
-[Chigs] Okay.

340
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] This one is nice and chewy
in the middle, crisp on the outside.

341
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very good orange.
-[Paul] Your flavours are good,

342
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's a shame
we didn't get marzipan coming through.

343
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But good job.
-Thank you.

344
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I just love your cheeky girls.

345
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, their little astonished mouths

346
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and eyelashes going out the side
is just beautiful.

347
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It needed
slightly longer in the oven,

348
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because it looks like raw paste.

349
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavour with the cinnamon,
with the apple, is delicious.

350
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The jam is spectacular.

351
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the colour of these,
but they're all over the place.

352
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think they're a bit too big.

353
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For me, there's too much chocolate.

354
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you manage to avoid the chocolate,
the almond flavour is delicious.

355
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] If you'd made them half-size,
bake them properly,

356
00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you'd have been getting a handshake.

357
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So if I'd just done it
completely different.

358
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Yeah.
-[all laughing]

359
00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:10.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I think the mulled wine biscuits are nice,
all 11 of them.

360
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The orange and chocolate one,
it's lost its definition.

361
00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The biscuit tastes beautiful.
It's such a delicate, buttery biscuit.

-Let's have a look at these.
-[Noel] These are called hearts, Paul.

363
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Most normal people have them.
-[Prue chuckles]

364
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Never seen one before.

365
00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is an astonishingly good biscuit.
-[Amanda] Thank you.

366
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Biscuit is very short and buttery
and delicious.

367
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The jam is sensational.

368
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, it really is worth every calorie.

369
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you so much.
-[Paul] Thank you very much.

370
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I think that's lovely.

371
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's so good is that the kirsch
and the cherry acidity

372
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
makes the whole thing lighter.

373
00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And these ones should be quite crisp.
Is that right?

374
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[George] They should be
crispy on the outside.

375
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As they age,
they get crispy on the inside too.

376
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I mean, it's tough.
-[George] Yeah.

377
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's so tough,
it's offering me out for a fight.

378
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I love the flavours of both.
You've done really well.

379
00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I question whether that was
the right choice to use on this challenge.

380
00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I completely agree.

381
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue chuckles]
-[Paul] But well done.

382
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

383
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not supposed to be like that.
The bottom of the biscuits stuck.

384
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, they're certainly chewy, Freya.
And they're delicious.

385
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Let's try this Christmas pud,
shall we?

386
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the flavours.
But it is certainly overbaked.

387
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, yeah.
-[Prue] It is overbaked.

388
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fruit has got a bit burnt.

389
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the flavour's lovely.
Especially the lemon.

390
00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think they look lovely.

391
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got some uniformity here,
which I like to see.

392
00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think they do look very nice.

393
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't add anything to that.
I think they look absolutely perfect.

394
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's try the star one first.
-[Jürgen] Yep.

395
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I flavoured them with Earl Grey tea.
-[Prue] Tea?

396
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It really comes through nice and strong.
-[Paul] Mmm. Yeah.

397
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really like it. Right.

398
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The horns. Shall we do the horns?

399
00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The coffee…
You can smell the coffee, can't you?

400
00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is the crumbliest,
buttery-est biscuit

401
00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I've ever eaten,
it is just perfect.

402
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

403
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's delicious.
I think you've done well there, Jürgen.

404
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

405
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] Thank you.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Good job.
-Wow. [laughs]

407
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was pretty overwhelming,
judging and a handshake.

408
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I nearly started to cry right there.

409
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Underbaked. I don't know.

410
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Should I really trust Paul?

411
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because I done them
for 15 minutes yesterday

412
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and Jürgen said they were overbaked.

413
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I done them for 12 minutes today,
and Paul's saying they're underbaked.

414
00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Jürgen's right. Just saying.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue would love you
to make Prinzregententorte.

432
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

433
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[normally] Your cake should be comprised
of eight thin layers

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

437
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your torte should be regally decorated

Have you met anyone from the royal family?

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

441
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have two hours, 45 minutes.

I ain't got a Scooby Doo.
I've never heard of this cake before.

445
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm making something
that I can't even pronounce. [chuckles]

446
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prinz-regen-ten-torte.

Ask Jürgen.

449
00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prinzregententorte.

450
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, Prue. Prinzregententorte.

451
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Basically, it's eight layers of genoises

452
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
sandwiched together
with a chocolate custard,

453
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
covered with really smooth, shiny ganache.

454
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I think it looks great.
It's highly effective.

455
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I think the temperature…
I think today being quite warm

456
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
will only be really affecting
the tempered chocolate.

457
00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Should be all right as long
as they chill things down in stages.

458
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] They ought to be able to get it
perfectly straight on the sides

459
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because they're putting it into a tin
to layer it up.

460
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Let's have a look inside.
-[Prue] Yeah. Let's have a look.

461
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I always love these layered cakes 'cause
they're so exciting when you see inside.

462
00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The layers
look beautiful and stark,

463
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you can see the chocolate custard
in there all the way through.

464
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And it's the right proportion
of custard to cake, isn't it?

465
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're about equal.
-[Paul] Let's see how it tastes.

466
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's delicious. Almost melts on the mouth.

467
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But then you get that
light chocolate come from the inside

468
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and that little bit
of dark chocolate ganache on the outside.

469
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's a great cake
to make on German week.

470
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I can't wait to see
how Jürgen deals with this.

471
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Hello, Jürgen!

472
00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm assuming that you're
the only person to have made this before.

473
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I haven't made one, I haven't eaten one.

474
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I can loosely remember how it looks like.
-Oh, you haven't even eaten one?

475
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a waste of being German.

476
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] Yeah, it's terrible.

477
00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>The first step in Prue's recipe</i>
<i>is to make the genoise sponge batter.</i>

478
00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have to make a meringue first, it says.

479
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Freya] I don't want the egg whites
to be like overly whipped.

480
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm thinking sort of, like,
soft, stiff peaks.

481
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm folding the meringue
into the egg yolk mixture.

482
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You got to be gentle when folding,

483
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because if you knock all the air out,
sponge is not gonna rise when you bake it.

484
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Giuseppe] Want to have all
the eight sheets in front of me.

491
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Give it a bit of consistency so
the layers are all the same height.

492
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want it to be not thicker
than five millimetres.

493
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

about a centimetre thick each?

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But… I think it'll be all right.

497
00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Batch-bake until you have eight sponges.

498
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There were three shelves in the oven.
So we can bake three layers at a time.

499
00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

502
00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's no timing in there or anything.
I'm gonna go in for 10 to 15 minutes.

503
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Seven minutes
and I'll swap the top and bottom

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Crystelle] I'm gonna bake one
to gauge the time.

506
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know if that's right,
but I'm going with it.

507
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

it is domed, isn't it?

676
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you wouldn't do a tiered yeasted cake.

Well, I've never made flowers in my life.
It's a little bit fiddly for me.

917
00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[chuckling] To be honest,
I make it up as I go.

919
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, we're nearly halfway
through this competition.

920
00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I know! How crazy is that?
-[Noel] And you're still here.

921
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I said that to my mum
and she was like, "Don't worry, Freya,

922

[both chuckling]

924
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never heard a cuter sentence.

925
00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[slurred] Bakers,
you've got one hour left.

926
00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

927
00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ay, and we have dough.

928
00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So my dough has risen, which is great.

929
00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just arranging my caramelised plums.

930
00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gonna sprinkle some more sugar
and cinnamon on top

931
00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so it caramelises
a little bit in the oven.

932
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All that needs to be done is egg washing
before it goes in the oven.

933

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[George] This is going to overflow.

936
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>And requires precision planning.</i>

937
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll take the first one out
after 20 minutes, the smallest one.

938
00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the next one I'll leave
for a further five minutes.

939
00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The other one I'll leave
for another five minutes.

940
00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] <i>But Freya's got other ideas.</i>

941
00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Freya] There we go.

942
00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To be honest with you,
they do actually bake like pretty similar

943
00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:08.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the little one is so small,
but it's a bit deeper.

944
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, yeah,
they're not that much different at all.

945
00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just a nice little break, isn't it?

946
00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, the very first we had in this tent.

947
00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, this bit's kind of, like,
chilled at the moment, but we'll see.

948
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Listen, I think the secret to
a good yeasted cake is being patient.

949
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just saying that
to make myself feel better.

950
00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] What did you just say to me?

951
00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

your erratic behaviour in here."

-In this zone.

953
00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Created a little calm zone.
-Yeah, I'm quite chilled.

954
00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can be calm.

955
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yeah.

956
00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like your mum and dad
used to play that competition a lot,

957
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
like, "Who can be
the quietest the longest?"

958
00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

959
00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'd just be sat there shaking,
bottling it up.

960

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just checking on it.
It should be coming out in two minutes.

As long as the middle is cooked.

980
00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the chocolate honeycomb.

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

when we were like, "Oh, do more wine"?

either in a glaze or an icing.

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] This is about as fattening
a mouthful as you could get.

1019
00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cream, the apple and cinnamon
work beautifully together.

1020
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the structure as well,
because it's quite light on the mouth.

1021
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Delicious.

1022
00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good job, Crystelle.

1023
00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very good job.

1024
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] It's quite pretty.
It's a bit dark. It's been overbaked.

1025
00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1026
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can see how dark that is in places.
But I like the design though, it's clever.

1027
00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I like the crystallized candy peel,
it's really good.

1028
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's quite a tough eat, isn't it?

1029
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's dry. Flavours are good, idea's good.

1030
00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's the overbaking that's done it for me.

1031
00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Chigs.
-Thank you, guys. Thank you very much.

1032
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's quite effective.
Not very neat down at the bottom.

1033
00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you can cover up a world of problems
with almonds on the outside.

1034
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But its dependent on the flavour.

1035
00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That's a lot of fruit.

1036
00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Flavour's fantastic.
-That's beautiful.

1037
00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The structure is perfect.
The bite is perfect.

1038
00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bake is spot-on.

1039
00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never had anything
quite like that before.

1040
00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1041
00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's not
the best-looking thing I've seen.

1042
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's one of the best-tasting things
I've had for a long time.

1043
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you so much.

1044
00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] There's so much bleeding
coming from the plums.

1045
00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It is a bit messy-looking.

1046
00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] If you had water icing
around the outside of each one,

1047
00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it'd look neater.

1048
00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Should we taste it?

1049
00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Let's have a look.

1050
00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The syrupy topping
is delicious, unusual and lovely.

1051
00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But there's an awful lot
of dough to topping.

1052
00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I think it could have done
with a little more baking.

1053
00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Yeah, it's too doughy.
-Yeah, it is underbaked.

1054
00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, it is.
-Got it.

1055
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you
-Thank you.

1056
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Well done.

1057
00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I think it's very pretty.

1058
00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It does look like an anniversary cake.

1059
00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] You need a stronger colour there.
-[George] Yeah.

1060
00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
See the colour you managed
to achieve down here?

1061
00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want the same up there.
You can see how light that is.

1062
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's almost been treated like a soft roll.

1063
00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[George] Yeah.
-[Paul] All right.

1064
00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Let's have a look.

1065
00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the flavour.
Chocolate-tahini balance is perfect.

1066
00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That's, erm… That's a raw dough.

1067
00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, is it?
-[Prue] The middle is raw.

1068
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's a bit clumsy,
it's been rushed.

1069
00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Thank you

1070
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I think it looks absolutely lovely.
I really do.

1071
00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's holding very well.
It doesn't seem to be squashing.

1072
00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I wanna go
straight down to the bottom.

1073
00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[all exclaiming]
-Well held.

1074
00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Giuseppe] Thank you.

1075
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I ain't letting no cake go to waste.
Not on my watch.

1076
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1077
00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] That looks really lovely.
Light, it's almost like a panettone.

1078
00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's better than a panettone, that.

1079
00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's almost like a whisked sponge.
The cherries are delicious.

1080
00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nice and tart, but they're sweet
at the same time.

1081
00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's delicious. I think you've
done an amazing job.

1082
00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Well done, Giuseppe.
-[Paul] Thank you, Giuseppe.

1083
00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I must say,
I think it looks really beautiful.

1084
00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's a lovely colour.

1085
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I can't wait to see
what it looks like inside.

1086
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite a breakfasty bake.

1087
00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think it's too bready?

1088
00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is very bready.
It's a little bit dry.

1089
00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to be really delicate with this
sort of thing to get the air in it.

1090
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That could have opened up
considerably more to make it much lighter.

1091
00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the flavour is good.
Overall, I like it.

1092
00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:03.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I don't love it, which is a shame.

1093
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It probably could have been lighter.

1094
00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It could have been in the oven less,
but I feel proud of what I've produced.

1095
00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Freya] I just loved it.

1096
00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To be totally flat-out honest,
that's what I hoped it'd look like.

1097
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In fact, I wouldn't have
wanted it to look any different

1098
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[George] I'm gutted. I'm really gutted.

1099
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Definitely feel I'm in danger.
Like, more than ever.

1100
00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I feel a bit sick.

1101
00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's talk about
who's in line for Star Baker.

1102
00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Giuseppe's done really well.

1103
00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, he's really beginning
to get into his stride now.

1104
00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could be one to watch.

1105
00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:45.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think overall Jürgen…
Jürgen's done all right, actually.

1106
00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He had a handshake yesterday.
-He did.

1107
00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was a little bit disappointed
with his Showstopper.

1108
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it looked so beautiful.
Because we think Jürgen is so good,

1109
00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:59.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when he doesn't do something perfectly,
we bang on about it.

1110
00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's still a very good yeasted cake.
-Yeah.

1111
00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:04.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I was a little bit
upset with George.

1112
00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, they were doughy.
I think Freya's down there as well,

1113
00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because Freya's Showstopper
wasn't as good as I was expecting.

1114
00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It was such a pity because
the actual syrup was delicious.

1115
00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it was that much cake
and a tiny bit of topping.

1116
00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] In Star Baker position,
you've got Giuseppe, Jürgen,

1117
00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and George and Freya down at the bottom.

1118
00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for two gruelling days in this hot tent.

1120
00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now the Star Baker this week is…

1121
00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is Giuseppe, congratulations.
-[all clapping]

1122
00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:53.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[murmurs indistinctly]

1123
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And now we have to lose someone.

1124
00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This gets harder and harder.

1125
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:03.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the person
that we are losing this week

1126
00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is someone who's brought
their own ideas into the tent.

1127
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we're very, very sorry to see them go.

1128
00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm afraid the person
who is leaving us this week is…

1129
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is Freya.

1130
00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
-[sobbing]

1131
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm really sad Freya's going.
My God, she is so talented.

1132
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You are literally
the most put-together 19-year-old

1133
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've ever met in my entire life.

1134
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That wait was agonising.

1135
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought, "I'm waiting
for my name to be called,

1136
00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm waiting for my name,"
and then, you know, poor Freya.

1137
00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Really gutted for her.</i>

1138
00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's very sad that Freya had to go.
She's done an amazing job.

1139
00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's 19 years old, vegan baking,
and she came halfway.

1140
00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There you go. That's how good she is.

1141
00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Should be really proud of yourself.

1142
00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Really proud of yourself.

1143
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Genuinely, I think it's the best
experience of my life.

1144
00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] You know, you've done so well.

1145
00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was feeling
the lack of experience quite a lot.

1146
00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>So, you know, I am 19.</i>

1147
00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>So I do feel really proud</i>
<i>to have even just been able to keep up.</i>

1148
00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, like, to get to week five
and do it vegan,

1149
00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
erm, I just feel like I really have
done what I wanted to do being here.

1150
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all] It's only vegan chocolate cake!

1151
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Giuseppe, he's done it again.

1152
00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Giuseppe absolutely deserved
Star Baker. Yes. [chuckles]

1153
00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Second Star Baker.

1154
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't… [clicks tongue]
I can't believe that.

1155
00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I want to think only of the next step,</i>

1156
00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so next week, it's gonna put me under
a lot of pressure to perform well,

1157
00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that's, erm…

1158
00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A difficult position to start in.
