Hey Sandi, look, I've been baking.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not sure I've totally nailed it,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I've put 'em in the oven
and then completely forgot about them.

-Is it?

5
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it's the theme of the week,
forgotten bakes.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles] Sometimes it's like
I'm working on a psychic level.

7
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, that's certainly one explanation.

8
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's very exciting. I can't actually
believe I'm still here. It's great.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's a bit weird. You're like,
oh, my God, where is everyone?

I think everyone's feeling it now.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
just bang out three good bakes,
and I should be fine.

31
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's see what happens, innit?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Morning, bakers.

33
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This week is all about forgotten bakes,

34
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's those classic creations of the past,
which lately may have been,

35
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
oh, I don't know, overlooked.

36
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] For your signature challenge,

37
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue and Paul would love you
to make a Bedfordshire Clanger.

38
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit like a Cornish pasty,

39
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
except this was for a farm worker's lunch,
as opposed to a tin miner's lunch.

40
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Made from suet pastry,

41
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
your clanger should be sweet
at one end, savoury at the other,

42
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with a sneaky pastry wall,
dividing the two,

43
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
assembled by a tiny pastry builder,
called Neville.

44
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You worry me.

45
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The judges would like your 2017 take
on this traditional recipe,

46
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
any flavours that you like, you've got two
hours to make four Bedfordshire Clangers.

47
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Clanger's a weird name. [snickers]

51
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The clanger? This is not
the kind of baking I like to do.

52
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

53
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not, no, I'm not really into
making clangers, no.

54
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] Conceptually, I think
it works really well,

55
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you know, savoury and the sweet,
your entire meal in one,

56
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I suppose
it's a bit like aeroplane food.

57
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just gotta deliver on this, haven't I?
Not drop any clangers. I'm here all week.

58
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

59
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] <i>A clanger, it's a bit</i>
<i>like a Cornish pasty,</i>

60
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
except it's long and thin
and sausage-shaped,

61
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>‘cause it has to contain two fillings.</i>

62
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One of the dangers
is getting the fillings right,

63
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so that they're not too wet
and will leak out.

64
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>The other danger is trying</i>
<i>to overcompensate for that,</i>

65
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and so they'll make</i>
<i>their fillings too dry.</i>

66
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't want a stodgy clanger.

67
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the key thing about the clanger
is the pastry itself.

68
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It must be made with suet.</i>

69
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If the pastry's too flimsy
and it breaks apart,

70
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>it indicates that they haven't</i>
<i>worked the dough enough.</i>

71
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Overmixed, it'll be like rubber and</i>
<i>you'll break your teeth getting into it.</i>

72
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's finding that balance between the two.

73
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just rubbing in my butter, into my suet,

74
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is that disgusting-looking
thing there, looks like bait,

75
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

76

78
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>When used to make pastry,</i>
<i>it creates a soft texture,</i>

79
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>firm enough to hold its shape when filled.</i>

80
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's replacing butter or lard,
or whatever you decide to use.

81
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think they originally used it because
it was so much cheaper than butter.

82
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite similar to other pastries,
try not to overwork it.

83
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hello, Steven.
-Good morning.

84
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, Bedfordshire Clanger.

85
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're going Mediterranean,
lots of herbs and spices.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What sort of colour
are you gonna get on your pastry?

89
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This colour, this colour, or this colour?

90
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, there you go.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Prue.

-Okay.

93
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are preparing a station for rolling.

94
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yeah.

95
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, do you want me to show you
how to do it like a baker?

96
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, go on, then.

97
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, you've gotta pinch,
and then you... You just do this.

98
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
See, I obviously wasn't going to

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I mean, you can barely pick it up.

303
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Just perhaps not quite
robust enough for a clanger.

304
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you gonna try the dip?

305
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know, it's perfectly all right,
but Mediterranean flavours are so strong,

306
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-you really don't need it.
-[Paul] Mmm. No, I agree.

307
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, the sweet.

308
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavours are very, very good.

309
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the, the balance
to the fruit is excellent.

310
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pastry is so light, though.

311
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Next time, work that pastry
a little bit more. Okay?

312
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Cool.
-[Paul] Thank you.

313
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Lovely colour, like the decoration, and...

314
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the pig. Love, love, love the pig.

315
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Yeah. Have you scored this?
-Yes.

316
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Mmm.
-It's weakened it slightly there.

317
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sophie] Yep.
-But it, it's robust. Right.

318
00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The pastry's
a little bit too thick.

319
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's baked well, it's spongy,
which is what it should be,

320
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
just think it's a little bit too thick.

321
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I'm a bit disappointed
in the filling,

322
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it's sort of,
predominantly soy flavour.

323
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-I'm not getting much else.

324
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Right.

325
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely flavour, bit dry.

326
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

327
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With the fact that your pastry's
still thick, that doesn't help.

328
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sophie] Yeah.
-It's just a bit of a shame.

329
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've been desperate
to get rid of those, haven't you?

330
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you not have these in your bakery?

331
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Clearly not.

332
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's not very robust, though...
[Steven] No.

333
00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] If you're carrying that
into a field.

334
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very good, and I think
it's the right texture.

335
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's moist without being sloppy.

336
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:53.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

337
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Beautiful flavour.
I love the spices, the blends.

338
00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm.
-It's a proper monstrous meal,

339
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's gorgeous. Now, looking
at the pudding, this is the baklava.

340
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Yeah.

341
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm.
-I think that's absolutely delicious.

342
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I just think it's totally the wrong
shape, it's, it's almost collapsed,

343
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the texture of the pastry
is very good.

344
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Steven, delicious.
-Thank you very much. Thank you.

345
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
There's been a little,
erm, blueberry explosion,

346
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so we know which end is sweet, even if
you hadn't put sweeties on.

347
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Go in here.

348
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you've got a great texture there.

349
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry is nice and flaky,
it's a little bit soft,

350
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as I'd expect from a suet crust.

351
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That, that's lovely, that.

352
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry's flaky, it's light,
it's got lots of flavour,

353
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's got a nice crisp on the outside,
and it's baked all the way through.

354
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The caramelised onions
are the heroes in there.

355
00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beautiful flavours. The sweet.

356
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I'm amazed
that you got such good texture,

357
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because the blueberries were raw,

358
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I rather expected them to sog up the
bottom of the pastry, but they haven't.

359
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That, young lady...
-Mmm.

360
00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:10.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-...is absolutely delicious, that side.
-[Prue] Ooh, well done.

361
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] Yes.
-[Prue] It's a great clanger.

362
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Feel good?
-Thank you.

363
00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Feel great, thank you very much, guys.
-Thank you.

364
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Go, girl.
-Thank you.

365
00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] <i>What a result. I don't know</i>
<i>what happened in there,</i>

366
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's not what happens
when I'm at home,

367
00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think it ever tasted
that good before.

368
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

369
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, didn't look like a clanger.

370
00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Welll... What does
a clanger look like, anyway?

371
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a little pink mouse,
as far as I'm concerned.

372
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When Prue says I'm really good
at flavours, it's like, yeah, er, yeah.

373
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, there's always like one thing
that I sort of fall short on.

374
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But then that's good for me, because
there's always something to improve on.

375
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, do you know what,
you've gotta keep laughing,

376
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
if you don't laugh, you'll cry, won't you?

377

378
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I dropped a clanger but, you know,
we move on from it, don't we?

379
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A little bit disappointing. Had this been
a couple of weeks ago

380
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would've considered that to be a,
an okay judging,

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

in a really sort of bad position.

on a classic technique of the past,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul would love you to make a traditional
recipe from Cumberland, the Rum Nicky.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

has a sweet shortcrust pastry base,

395
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a rum-soaked fruity filling, a rather
tricky little lattice number on top.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the classic way, with rum butter,

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not me. It is forgotten,
and probably for a good reason.

405
00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're looking for a really good
Rum Nicky, and I don't know what that is.

406
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So Paul, why have you chosen
this Rum Nicky?

407
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I came across this particular tart
about three years ago.

408
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's delicious.

409
00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, if you look
at the inside of that now,

410
00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's all about joining the fruit together
to create this one mass.

411
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have the flavour of the rum,
you have the fruit,

412
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which almost melts in the mouth.

413
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm.
-The pastry is flaky.

414
00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's lovely. And you can
really taste the rum.

415
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The rum is king in this.

416
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're looking for something, it's gonna
taste of rum but not of alcohol.

417
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, the lattice, it's gonna be
fascinating to see how they lattice.

418
00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they totally enclose that pie with,
the alcohol cannot evaporate off.

419
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, to make it
as it would've been done 230 years ago...

420
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I expect them to take this pastry
right into the edge.

421
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, how long do they bake it for?
'Cause I know you didn't tell them that.

422
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thirty-five minutes in total.

423
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That'll create a beautiful, golden pie.

424
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And have you given them a machine
to, erm, make the rum butter with?

425
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not a monster, Prue. Supplied them
with a wooden spoon and a bowl.

426
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] So I'm just
chopping up this dried fruit,

427
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the instruction is,

428
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Mix the dried fruits, ginger, rum and
sugar together and then leave to soak."

429
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Liam] Pretty much
it's just a standard tart,

430
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's just the filling
that's a bit odd.

431
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] To be honest with you,
this kind of

432
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
soaked-through rum thing is not my bag,

433
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I'll just, you know, wing it.

434
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oi, "Measure 50 ml," and they haven't
provided a measuring jug. Okay.

435
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anything even remotely useful
on the measuring front?

436
00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

437
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Think about this, Steven, 50 ml.

438
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To be fair, I like rum-soaked stuff.
I love rum.

439
00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Little bit more for luck.

440
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm, this smells
like Christmas, doesn't it?

441
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No more rum.

442
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoo!

443
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going in.

444
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, so, leave that to soak
and make the sweet shortcrust.

445
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's get this done.

446
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] The recipe is,
it's really quite detailed,

447
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so my instructions
for making the shortcrust pastry

448
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
are, "Make the shortcrust pastry."

449
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] Well, it doesn't say how to do it,

450
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I've gotta combine my butter, my sugar
and my flour together, fingertips.

451
00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] You need to be careful
with shortcrust

452
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that you don't overwork it, so like
a nice light rubbing action.

453
00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I know this is a forgotten bake...
-Well, 'cause...

454
00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But fundamentally, it's a fruit tart
with a lattice...

455
00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's an alcoholic fruit tart
with a lattice top.

456
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's not to like?

457
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sounds like a perfect drag queen,
if you ask me.

458
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

459
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] I've just added
a teaspoon of lemon juice,

460
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then one to two
teaspoons of cold water.

461
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It should just be enough moisture
just to combine it.

462
00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] Do you know what, in all honesty,

463
00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the pastries that I made in the signature,
that's what I want now.

464
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, let's get this tin lined.

465
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't know if I'm doing the whole thing.

466
00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] I'm just gonna have to
just cut it and hope for the best.

467
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Could you, mmm, yes.
-Mmm.

468
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, further, further, further, further.

469
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, you're quite bossy.

470
00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam laughs]

471
00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just using a bit of pastry
to get into all the nooks.

472
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Add the filling to the lined tin."
All the filling.

473
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then you add butter. That's quite curious.

474
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right bakers, you have 45 minutes
to finish your Rum Nicky

475
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or if you want to be a bit more formal,
your Rum Nicholas.

476
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you have enough rum, you probably
do end up knickerless.

477
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Fourteen strip lattice with the
remaining pastry." Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

478
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want 14 strips.

479
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just gonna have to go
with my gut instinct on this one.

480
00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is definitely the hardest part
of the challenge for me,

481
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
without a shadow of a doubt.

482
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] I just do not know
how I'm, hell I'm gonna do that.

483
00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A very, very bad mess.

484
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

485
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, as per the instructions,
you arrange it

486
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
on a piece of greaseproof paper first.

487
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The trick is to sort of
lay the strip across

488
00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then fold back the other ones
that you didn't do last time.

489
00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] I think Steven's doing his
entirely different to mine.

490
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's doing some kind of pull-part one,

491
00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I'm doing what I would call,
like, traditional lattice.

492
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] Yeah, I did think about
doing it that way, but I like this way.

493
00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're gonna run cuts
up the side for the pastry,

494
00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and as you pull the pastry apart,
you get lattice.

495
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's gotta be a quicker way to do this.
Oh, I don't know.

496
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's happening here?
-Do you know what, I don't know.

497
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Intricate latticework.

498
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Intrutive. Yeah, but you know what,
I've just turned round

499
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and Steven's doing something
entirely different.

500
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that good or bad?
-Well, it's obviously bad, isn't it...

501
00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you scared?

502
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because he knows
what he's doing, and I don't.

503
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe not, maybe you know
what you're doing.

504
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, now.

505
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-[laughs] Come on, now.

506
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] Just wanna get
this lattice right, it's really important.

507
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really important.

508
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have I got 14?

509
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know.

510
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you only have half an hour
left to whip up your Rum Nicky.

511
00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got 30 minutes, for God's sake.

512
00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] Over, under, over.

513
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I'm taking ages, man.

514
00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There, any idea? Arhh.

515
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I've messed this up.
I hate this so much, hate it.

516
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It should just be
enough latticework, but...

517
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Too short.

518
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this where it's gonna get a bit messy?

519
00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, er, there. What on earth was that?

520
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know what,
this hasn't actually worked.

521
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, we've got 20 minutes,
if that, to reroll this.

522
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Steven...
-Hi...

523
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't help noticing
that you're doing your latticework again.

524
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it didn't work out, so I'm gonna
have to go back to the drawing board...

525
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You all right there, you got time?

526
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs] I don't know how long
this thing bakes for, but hey-ho,

527
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we'll just have to do our best.

528
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] I'm not really sure about this,

529
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm thinking, um, I should cut
the rest of it off.

530
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] I'm so bad at this.

531
00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

532
00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] God, it's not easy, is it?

533
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm putting on an egg wash now,
and then that is going to the oven.

534
00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] Everyone else
is doing the whole dish,

535
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I'm the only one
that's done the inner part of it.

536
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. Oh, gosh, I don't know.

537
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] So ragged.

538
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales] I don't know what to do.

539
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, it's going in.

540
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not the prettiest, which is annoying.

541
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've just whacked the temperature up
and I'll leave it.

542
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I've whacked
the temperature right up,

543
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
‘cause it's not gonna bake in time.

544
00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] Do I trim it?

545
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's your gut telling you?

546
00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

547
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You just have to trust your instincts.

548
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's so bad.

549
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're all right, don't panic.

550
00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

551
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's hope we can redeem ourselves
with some rum butter.

552
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it says, "Just make the rum butter,"
and then it's just got the ingredients.

553
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, atrocious.

554
00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm doing 160 until the end.

555
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think it's going to be
in the oven long enough.

556
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[exhales] I just took way too long
on the lattice.

557
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have 10 minutes,
just 10 minutes,

558
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to complete your technical challenge.

559
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] It just seems
like an awful lot of sugar.

560
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who the hell would wanna have this to eat?

561
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I remember it being quite grainy,
so I'm not expecting it to be mega-smooth.

562
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] My God, I am absolutely sweating.

563
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just not a butter. That can't
be right, it tastes disgusting.

564
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think maybe I'll just keep stirring it
until the end

565
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and hopefully it gets less grainy.

566
00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I started this in 1792,
and I'm still going.

567
00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you've got
just one minute left, one minute.

568
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] God, they do not
make your life easy.

569
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] It's come together now,
it's nice and whippy.

570
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven exhales]

571
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] Rum butter's done,
I think we'll do all right.

572
00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm never doing this again.

573
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] This is enough rum butter.

574
00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thirty seconds.

575
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Stunning.

576
00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is raw. Atrocious.

577
00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up.

578
00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please bring your Rum Nickies
up to the gingham table.

579
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] Raw, raw, raw.

580
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue are looking</i>
<i>for a thin pastry bottom,</i>

581
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>a beautiful lattice top</i>
<i>and smooth rum butter,</i>

582
00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and as usual, they won't know</i>
<i>whose Rum Nicky is whose.</i>

583
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Right, we'll start
with the one at the end.

584
00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You needed to take the sides up
to the top of the plate,

585
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that's a major issue.

586
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The lattice is certainly not cooked and
I'll eat my hat if the bottom is cooked.

587
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Wow. We have a raw base.

588
00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yeah.

589
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pastry's very raw.

590
00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It is.

591
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Right, well,
that was a disappointment.

592
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Now, the latticework
on this is even.

593
00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need to leave gaps, to allow
the alcohol to evaporate.

594
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And again, I think it would be much
better if the pastry came to the edge.

595
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The rum flavour's there,

596
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the alcohol couldn't penetrate
through the sheer volume of lattice,

597
00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and a bit grainy
on the, um, rum butter, as well.

598
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, moving on to number three,

599
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this is more like it, a nice coverage of
the pastry, which goes right to the end.

600
00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The lattice is a bit sparse,
that's a little bit too thin,

601
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it has got the best colour,
it's nice and brown.

602
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm, I could just sit there
and eat a lot of that.

603
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Er, it just looks a little bit
thrown together.

604
00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Right, moving on to this,
lattice is very good,

605
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
er, needed less of them, right.

606
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can see how soft
that pastry is underneath.

607
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's much more cooked
than I thought it would be.

608
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, the flavours are lovely.

609
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It looks neat.
-Yes, it looks very nice.

610
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think if it had had
a little longer in the oven,

611
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it would be a pretty good pie.

612
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Moving on to the last one,
we have something

613
00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that's shrunk back slightly
from the sides,

614
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the colour's not bad on the edge.

615
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They've so nearly got it to the end.

616
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm, yeah, it's just a little bit again
in the middle, but it's nearly done, yes.

617
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it's good. It's very nice
and thin, the pastry.

618
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Less alcohol in that one as well.

619
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Mmm.
-You've got the flavour of the rum.

620
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very good.

621
00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bit smoother on the butter as well.

622
00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] This is perfect rum butter.

623
00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>Prue and Paul will now rank the</i>
<i>Rum Nickies from the worst to the best.</i>

624
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, in fifth place is this one.

625
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Liam, obviously it needed to go
in the oven for longer,

626
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because it's quite raw.

627
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In fourth place is this one.

628
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sophie, the lattice looks absolutely
beautiful, but it is too closed.

629
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In third position is this one.
Too many lattice strips.

630
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It said 14, so we did 14.

631
00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thirteen, 14, 15.

632
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, 15. Oh. I've always had
a problem with maths.

633
00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, in second place is this one here.

634
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kate, this is absolutely delicious.

635
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The rum butter is the best we've seen.

636
00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, in first place is this one.

637
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice gaps between the lattice,

638
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the balance of flavours in the fruit
and the rum is perfect.

639
00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although your butter's
a little bit grainy.

640
00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was unexpected.

641
00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel incredible, I do feel a little bit
like I cheated, though.

642
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just threw it in the oven,
and it came first. But, I'll take it.

643
00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hope it's redeemed me
a little bit from this morning,

644
00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>because if I'd done really bad,</i>

645
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd have to do something spectacular
tomorrow to even be considered to stay.

646
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] <i>To come third in the technical</i>
<i>is great at this late stage, </i>

647
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so tomorrow I'll have to get
my head down and go for it.

648
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Every element needs to be pukka.

649
00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think anyone says
"pukka" any more, but, pukka.

650
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm really not happy. All in all, probably
the worst day I've had actually so far,

651
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so not great to be pulling that
sort of thing out in the quarter-finals.

652
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hate coming last. I'm just gonna have to
pull it out of the bag again.

653
00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I gotta do a vintage Liam.

654
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>One challenge left before Paul</i>
<i>and Prue choose star baker,</i>

655
00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and decide who must miss out</i>
<i>on a place in the semi-final.</i>

656
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>I don't know</i>
<i>if I can stand the tension.</i>

657
00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quarter-finals, you think you might know

658
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who's gonna get in to the top
and it's all over the place.

659
00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Steven has had a bit of a dip,
he's coming back now, strong,

660
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>coming into the semi-finals next week.</i>

661
00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the time to get good.

662
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But Stacey, handshake from her clanger.

663
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastries, the shape, the flavour,
it ticked all the boxes.

664
00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would absolutely love Stacey
to make it to star baker,

665
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>‘cause she's worked so hard to get there.</i>

666
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Liam, Sophie and Kate are all
in a little bit of trouble.

667
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Mmm.
<i>-Kate didn't do too well in the signature.</i>

668
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>But she came back,</i>

<i>-Second.</i>

670
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] <i>I'd like</i>

671
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>but coming last in the technical,</i>

672
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
automatically puts you
into a difficult position,

673
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and I think Sophie's</i>
<i>in quite a bit of trouble.</i>

674
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who could believe this?

675
00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Her char siu pork was, was okay,

676
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>but she was fourth in the technical,</i>

677
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I think Sophie has the capability
of saving herself,

678
00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it's down to the showstopper.

679
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they wanna get through
to the semi-final next week,

680
00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they've got to pull their socks up and
create something that's pure magic.

681
00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Morning, bakers.
For your showstopper challenge today,

682
00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we're heading back to Victorian times,

683
00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'm going up a blinking chimney,
and Sandi will not be amused.

684
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Today, the judges would like you to make
a Victorian favourite, the Savoy Cake.

685
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, I'm not gonna
lie to you, traditionally,

686
00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this banqueting centrepiece
was rather inedible,

687
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but Prue and Paul would like you
to make a light, delicate sponge

688
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
baked in an elaborate mould
with a hard sugar coating.

689
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your Savoy Cake can be
any flavour you want,

690
00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but to create that Victorian drama,

691
00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
must be served on a plinth,
also created from sponge.

692
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, you need a bit of sponge engineering,
you need to be the Brunel of baking.

693
00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] You have three-and-a-half hours.

694
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi and Noel]
On your marks, get set, bake!

695
00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] The last bake
before the semi-finals is big anyway.

696
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It doesn't make it any easier the fact

697
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that this is a complete unknown,
this cake.

698
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think one's been seen
since about 1890.

699
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't really think this is like
any other cake I've kind of had before.

700
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit of a weird one, this, isn't it?

701
00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] Not a great day yesterday.
I like to come back to cakes,

702
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't like stodgy, old-fashioned pastry.
I like pretty things.

703
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A Victorian Savoy Cake would've been an
amazing centrepiece, a real showstopper,

704
00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and that's what we want from our bakers,
but it was very seldom eaten.

705
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We want them to taste amazing as well.

706
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is gonna be a little bit tricky.

707
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:25.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Traditionally, the Savoy Cake is made
in quite an elaborate mould,

708
00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but there's no rising agent in there,
there's no fat in there,

709
00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>so the blending of the whites</i>

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

of success with this at home.

816
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

would sort of stay in the tin.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it doesn't, so we will see.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I would've liked it
a bit more even all around.

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, okay, so,
make the second Savoy Cake.

the consistency of the choux right,

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it can be piped but it's not too thick.

890
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] That's gonna go in
for about 45 minutes.

895
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the choux pastry done
and then I've got to pipe it out,

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then as soon as my support cakes
are out of the oven,

898
00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Kate] My plans for decoration, cut out a
Liver Bird, and the story behind them is,

900
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if the Liver Birds ever leave Liverpool,
it'll be no more.

901

I piped some chocolate
into the straws,

903
00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna freeze them, and once
they're set, I'm gonna poke them out.

904
00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] This is my favourite thing to do,
jelly-making.

905
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get them in the fridge, done, and then,

906
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's just buttercream,
madeleines, meringues.

907
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales] I forgot this.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, the other one's gonna come out.

909
00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] These are sugar paste roses,

910
00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did 150 of them
for my mum's 60th cake last year,

911
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it took me two days, but if I can just
get 'em to look like roses, I'll be happy.

912
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Choux buns, gonna go in.

913
00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] Right, let's have
a look at this cake. Not far off.

914
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just broke the oven.

915
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[bleeping]

916
00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oven door's come off.
I'm panicking. I'm taking it out.

917
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Can she share mine at 150?

918
00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, no, no, you carry on.

919
00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all right,
I'll just hold it like this.

920
00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could do with maybe a minute or two longer
but hopefully it won't deflate.

921
00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] What happened to Stacey?
[Steven] Her oven broke.

922
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Her oven broke?
-[Steven] Yeah.

923
00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God.

924
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

925
00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Queen Victoria, Prince Albert,
you be Prince Albert.

926
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have one hour left
to finish your sponge plinths.

927
00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, it's more like Angela Merkel.

928
00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything was going so well.

929
00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Perfect.

930
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Liam] The only thing
I'm not pleased about is

931
00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that my plinth's a lot darker
than these two.

932
00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Not bad.

933
00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] Plinth's stuck in the, erm, mould.

934
00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just carry on and I'll see if I can try
and decorate my way round this.

935
00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oops, I'm going to take it out.

936
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I think we're just about okay.

937
00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, let me just try and regroup,
is there any ovens on and spare?

938
00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] This is gonna be
for the chocolate decorations.

939
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna make a chocolate clock.

940
00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going to make little petals and
hopefully make a chocolate flower.

941
00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do like to do this kind of stuff.

942
00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] Should do another one.

943
00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] Fifteen minutes, now I wanna
check my macaroons.

944
00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've had to use another oven,

945
00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but luckily there is another oven to use,
so we're all right.

946
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's get madeleining, shall we?

947
00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Get them in the fridge to chill.

948
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

949
00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] See if we can
get these babies in.

950
00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The main thing now, get the meringues in.

951
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got two minutes
to get them in the oven.

952
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think you've got more time
than you have. All of a sudden, it...

953
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whooshes]

954
00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] I've got to fill
all my choux buns and

955
00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then I've got to assemble
my chocolate flower.

956
00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still quite a lot to do.

957
00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Liam] This is certainly not the time
for shaky hands. Gotta keep composed.

958
00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[gasps] Oh God, oh no.
I've killed the Liver Bird off.

959
00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I picked it up, to move it,
and it just went...

960
00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs] Oh, dear. I seem to have
jinxed myself regularly, don't I?

961
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] It's a bit lopsided.

962
00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] So, this is improvisation,
I'm just gonna make a chocolate instead.

963
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Savoy-oy, bakers, you have
30 minutes left, 30 minutes.

964
00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey]
The meringues are in the oven,

965
00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so there's not a lot I can do
about it now.

966
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] Okay, so, spun sugar.

967
00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] Taking ages,
but they're getting there.

968
00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, sir, have you come for your shave?
What is this, darling, what is it?

969
00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's, it's fats, so I, I...
-Oh.

970
00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is really stressful.
-[Liam] It's the finishing touches,

971
00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's really weird
that I've finished kinda early.

972
00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you've done great for time,
it's not like you're rushing now.

973
00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it's a bit weird. In all honesty,
I've actually never timed this.

974
00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. I won't tell anybody.

975
00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Just got a few that I've dipped

976
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in freeze-dried strawberries
and in pearl sugar.

977
00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] Without realising it,
this is probably

978
00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
something that the Victorians
would've appreciated.

979
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

980
00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The macaroons are a bit big, but it
doesn't matter, big's better than small.

981
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The spun sugar, er, now, it's just
gonna dissolve. Tsss. Yeah.

982
00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ugh, I keep dropping them.

983
00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

984
00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Five minutes before you have
to present your Savoy Cake.

985
00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Argh.

986
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is gonna get done
by the skin of my teeth.

987
00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] Don't drop it.

988
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

989
00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, they're not great. They're
just not ready, they're not cooked.

990
00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't even know if I should
put them on, to be honest.

991
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Liam] Do you know if Paul and Prue
could see it before the sugar melts?

992
00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please, please, please, please.

993
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Cutting it fine.

994
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God, that's just cracked.

995
00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, that is it, your time is up.

996
00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please place your showstopper Savoy Cakes
at the end of your station.

997
00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can I just do [stammering] ten more?

998
00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sophie, stop!

999
00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stopped, I've stopped.

1000
00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Almost.

1001
00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like this much left. [exhales]

[Sandi] <i>It's judgement time</i>
<i>for the Victorian centrepieces.</i>

1004
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But these Savoy Cakes will need</i>
<i>to taste as good as they look.</i>

1005
00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow, Stacey, it really has got
about 20 elements to it, hasn't it?

1006
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm very impressed that you've got
all the cakes out quite cleanly.

1007
00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a nice shiny sugar crust.
But you struggled with the meringue.

1008
00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it... They weren't done in time.

1009
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But overall I think it's very you.
-[Paul] Stacey.

1010
00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] It's very Stacey. It...
-Victorian Stacey.

1011
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] And we've got the orange one
on the top, is that right?

1012
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1013
00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's got a nice texture.

1014
00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great flavour.

1015
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm.
-Really nice flavour,

1016
00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the texture's amazing, and the orange
comes through well.

1017
00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, this is your lemon one,
is that right?

1018
00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yep. Very good texture.

1019
00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not as well flavoured
as the other, is it?

1020
00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's there, it's not as potent
as the orange one.

1021
00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, you've got madeleines, you've got
macarons, you've got some jelly.

1022
00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The mandarins are a little bit flat,

1023
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you've got the raspberry right
in the middle of that, haven't you?

1024
00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Mmm. Yeah, the raspberry's
very nice, but the macarons,

1025
00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because they've been sandwiched
with the curd have got very soggy.

1026
00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The macarons I don't particularly like,
I don't think they're well baked.

1027
00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Have you tried a hard jelly?

1028
00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very nice.

1029
00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think overall, you've just gone
slightly OTT on the decoration.

1030
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But your two cakes are good.

1031
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:54.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's a massive work,
probably a titch overambitious,

1032
00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I think it's a real achievement.

1033
00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] I think it looks
a little bit haphazard.

1034
00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's a bit topsy-turvy.

1035
00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the decoration
of the sugar, that's fine,

1036
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but you can see what's happened,

1037
00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that over time we, it will collapse,
humidity gets to it, destroys it.

1038
00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So it's elderflower.
-Elderflower and lemon.

1039
00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite dense.

1040
00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1041
00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Almost like
you've overmixed it, you know?

1042
00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Prue] I think you did.

1043
00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm just not catching
any flavours at all.

1044
00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1045
00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The most flavour you get from this is
if you happen to get a bit of caramel.

1046
00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a little disappointing.

1047
00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It is a little bit.

1048
00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The top layer is better than the bottom,
I think the bottom one is burnt.

1049
00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A quarter-final, you want...
-[Liam] Yeah.

1050
00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Consistency.

1051
00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've had a really great idea,
Liam, don't think you quite pulled it off.

1052
00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Sophie, I think that is a perfect shape
of a Victorian Savoy Cake.

1053
00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's nice and high,
it's spectacular to look at,

1054
00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the chocolate top is magnificent.

1055
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's very, very clever.

1056
00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you break through, you've got
your plinth down at the bottom down there,

1057
00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is sandwiched as well,
so you've given that a flavour.

1058
00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's well baked all the way through,

1059
00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you've got a nice sugar coating
on the top of it as well,

1060
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I love the design.

1061
00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've celebrated the Savoy Cake,
which I like.

1062
00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, I'm gonna take a slice out of this.

1063
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The texture of the cake is quite chewy.
-[Sophie] Okay.

1064
00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's very pleasant.

1065
00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the flavour. I just think,
when you mixed it,

1066
00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you may have just turned it
a couple of more times than you needed to.

1067
00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-And you've lost that air.

1068
00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:38.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you're not far off it.

1069
00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Remind me what's in there?
-Er, green apple Crème Diplomat.

1070
00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, I love that green apple, really good.

1071
00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love that whole cake, actually.
Thank you.

1072
00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very elegant, very simple.

1073
00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm.
-Very small.

1074
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It makes you question, what have you
spent the last few hours making?

1075
00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the time's been spent on the roses,
and they do look beautiful.

1076
00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very elegant.

1077
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I must say that your sugar coating
looks really good,

1078
00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I do think you've been very clever,

1079
00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause those walnuts
perfectly fit the mould.

1080
00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's beautifully done.

1081
00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Now, right in the middle there you have--
-They're cinnamon apples.

1082
00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely cinnamon apple.

1083
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not what I expected.
-No, but it is delicious,

1084
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the texture, I think, is lovely.

1085
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's actually very brave of you
to put the chestnuts in there,

1086
00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because chestnut in itself
is quite a heavy thing.

1087
00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1088
00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But actually it hasn't affected
the texture too much,

1089
00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:44.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's still quite light, but for me,
if you're gonna put chestnut in it,

1090
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
get the flavour to come out,
'cause it hasn't.

1091
00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-But nevertheless, very pretty design.

1092
00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1093
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kate, please bring up your Savoy Cake.
Do you want some help?

1094
00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, please.

1095
00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ready?
-Yep, ready.

1096
00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is like the weirdest removal firm.

1097
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I can see what it is, with the top...
-Mmm.

1098
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
...of the Liver Building,
but it's a bit simplistic.

1099
00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bottom plinth
has had a few major issues.

1100
00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it didn't turn out properly.

1101
00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These seem to have caught again.
It's all a bit broken up.

1102
00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I do think
it's a bit rough and ready,

1103
00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I like the fact
that she's got the height.

1104
00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, yeah. It's a bold piece.

1105
00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sugar coating on it's good,
but look how yellow that is.

1106
00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sixty eggs have made that
very, very yellow.

1107
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit dry, actually.

1108
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Mmm, I was wondering
if it's a bit overcooked, in fact.

1109
00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, I think it could be.

1110
00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Oh, that's the one
with pecans in it.

1111
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a much better cake.

1112
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's delicious.
-[Prue] It's moister, too.

1113
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm. I'm biased anyway,
'cause I love the Liver Building,

1114
00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but star of the show
is that third one down.

1115
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I just think all the others, too dry.
-Okay.

1116
00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Wow, what a week.

1117
00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's been a tremendous week.

1118
00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I know that Stacey has been
really scrapping for star baker.

1119
00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it possible?

1120
00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's certainly possible, because
Stacey has done remarkably well.

1121
00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just think she attempted
slightly too much.

1122
00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Having said that, this was about
the Savoy Cake and they tasted amazing.

1123
00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, I think Steven
is the favourite coming into today

1124
00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and he did create something
that technically was very good.

1125
00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flowers, perfect, the leaves
are great, the cake is well-made.

1126
00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm.
-But the chestnut didn't get the flavour.

1127
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, let's focus on the ones
who are in trouble.

1128
00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:36.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sophie, perhaps, has saved herself?

1129
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Oh, Sophie's
definitely saved herself.

1130
00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nobody who can make a cake like that
can possibly go home.

1131
00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, Liam and Kate are in a bit of trouble.

1132
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you look at Kate's,
she's used pretty basic moulds,

1133
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's quite rudimentary,
the decoration as well.

1134
00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And she'd dried out a couple
of the sponges,

1135
00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the pecan one was particularly good.

1136
00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whereas the elderflower in Liam's one,
you didn't think came through.

1137
00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I couldn't taste anything.

1138
00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then he put sugar-work on something

1139
00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that was gonna stand for
a long period of time, and it collapsed.

1140
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But she didn't do as well
in her signatures as Liam.

1141
00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
His clangers were very good.

1142
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it seems to me
you keep balancing out things.

1143
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It goes like that all the time.

1144
00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm.
-Yeah, we have to break it down,

1145
00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
go through the checklist again,
and then decide.

1146
00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's something lovely, Paul,
about sitting here

1147
00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
listening to you talk
in front of the Liver Bird.

1148
00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, isn't it?
-There you go.

1149
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you just ate his head.

1150
00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow, it was so pretty,
up until that minute.

1151
00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Congratulations, bakers,
on surviving forgotten bakes week.

1152
00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, I've got the great job this week
of announcing star baker.

1153
00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The person who's won star baker this week

1154
00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
made clangers with their trademark twist,

1155
00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and made a Savoy Cake that
had fabulous texture and flavour.

1156
00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The star baker this week is...

1157
00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stacey.

1158
00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cor. Yay. Thank you.

1159
00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, that leaves me
with just the worst job.

1160
00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well done to all of you
for getting through to the quarter-finals,

1161
00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I'm afraid the person going home is...

1162
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Liam.
-It's cool.

1163
00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm so sorry.
-It's cool.

1164
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's in all fairness, like, I can
look back, probably tomorrow morning,

1165
00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think, yeah, I smashed it.

1166
00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1167
00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>It's not the end of me, yeah,</i>
<i>this is just the beginning,</i>

1168
00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know what I mean, so,

1169
00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm coming for Paul Hollywood's job
in a couple of years' time.

1170
00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't stop baking, all right?

1171
00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] <i>So sorry to lose Liam,</i>
<i>he's learnt a lot.</i>

1172
00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:57.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
From the beginning to now, he's a
different baker, totally different baker.

1173
00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>He's done really well</i>
<i>to reach the quarter-final,</i>

1174
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>and should feel very proud of himself.</i>

1175
00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But he had a bad showstopper,
and that's what it came down to.

1176
00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Fantastic.
-Well, thank you.

1177
00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So glad you did it,
because you've been so close, so often.

1178
00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Stacey has wanted star baker so badly.

1180
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Her last few weeks she's got closer
and closer, and this week, bingo.

1181
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this is the time to get star baker,
and she's started to nail it this week.

1186
00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

in week nine, no way, week nine.
