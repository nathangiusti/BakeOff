55
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When we think of a torte,
it's usually quite a rich cake,

56
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a bit more dense and luxurious.

57
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is what
we want the bakers to think of,

58
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it must not have
any wheat flour in it.

59
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So they could use chestnut,
they can use ground almonds,

60
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
whatever they wish,
but it tends to make the cake quite heavy.

61
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bakers have gotta be
careful on the fillings,

62
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

raspberries, strawberries, fruits.

63
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's an opportunity for the bakers
to show off their piping skills,

64
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
their spinning skills,
their moulding skills.

65
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They can show off a bit and they should.

[Cristy] I'll conceal
the messy edge with the collar.

306
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That looks a bit more like it.

311
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is really difficult.

312
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My hand's shaking.

313
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] I messed that.

314
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Cristy] It's not worked.

315
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's magic.

316
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Cristy] I need to do some decorations,
my leaves haven't worked.

317
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna put some of this on here.

318
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tickety-boo,
I took that out the freezer.

319
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, so here we go, glazing.

320
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have only one minute left.

321
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do we really? Gosh, Paul is gonna hate it.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm finished. I want to eat that.

324
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
White chocolate, then truffles.

325
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is really messy.

326
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so embarrassed.

327
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Finished. [sighs]

328
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, bakers, that is your time up.

329
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Well done.

331
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
did you just put
40 raspberries in your mouth?

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

Nicky, I agree,
I think it's a little work of art.

341
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's elegant, it's classy and cool.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

344
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, don't. The proof is in the pudding.

345
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It is.

346
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The mousse
is holding its shape, which is great.

347
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm. Flavours are great,
really strong chocolate.

348
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needed a fruit in there,
a raspberry, strawberry

349
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or something tart to break down
that chocolate a little bit.

350
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But a decent job. Thank you.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[whispers] Very good.

352
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The outside doesn't look so good.
A bit wobbly.

353
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] If you take the sides off,
look at the top, it looks nice.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Is this ground almonds in here?
-Ground almonds, ground hazelnuts.

356
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour of the cake and praline mousse

357
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
work beautifully well together
with that chocolate top. It's lovely.

358
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

360
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh, look at that.

361
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavour is fantastic.
Cherry flavour's beautiful.

362
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the cherry and the mascarpone filling
that you've got is a bit weak.

363
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] If you had overnight to set it,
it would've been better.

364
00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I like the colour, I like the shine.
The sides, however,

365
00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
are not particularly good. Oh, dear.

366
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] This is definitely dessert
rather than cake.

367
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is absolutely delicious. The tartness
of the raspberries come through.

368
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You get the chocolate.

369
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, it tastes amazing,
but it's almost a pudding, isn't it?

370
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Where are the leaves?

371
00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I hate that mould so much.
-[chuckles]

373
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's in the bin.

374
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's messy where the collar joins the cake
'cause you want that nice and smooth.

375
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you know what?
It still looks extremely inviting.

376
00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, Prue.

377
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The cake is a little bit dry.

378
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-[Paul] And very crumbly.

379
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think you need more cherries,
more cherry brandy.

380
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
More chocolate. It's got no real flavour.

381
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bloody hell.
-Does that mean it's got no calories?

382
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah. [laughs]
-[Alison] No flavour, no calories.

383
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul laughs]

384
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Well, I must say, I think it looks
very neat and quite original.

385
00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-More height would've been nicer.
-Don't forget to try chilli truffle.

386
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Will this blow my head off?

387
00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hopefully not.

388
00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't mind the chilli,
I think the texture's too gluey.

389
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It reminds me of Mexico,
but it's overwhelming on the alcohol.

390
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I would agree with that.

391
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I'm not sure that finish
looks as good as it could.

392
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Come on,
I'm dying for a bite of ginger.

393
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ginger's lovely and strong,
I like it.

394
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the texture of the cake
is very pudding-y, too moist.

395
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The ginger brings the heat,
but what I do get is a tonne of amaretto.

396
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For me it's drowned it.

397
00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's a bit messy.

398
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
And Saku written, it probably needed
to be little bit more stark.

399
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] In white chocolate,
it would've stood out better.

400
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very chocolatey.

401
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The raspberry's coming through.
Chocolate's beautiful and strong.

402
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's a little bit
too gooey in the middle.

403
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite heavy
and so you can't eat a lot of it.

404
00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-[Paul] Very elegant.
-It is.

405
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Beautifully smooth, got a lovely shine.
Decorations are good, pipework is good.

406
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Let's see if it's as good inside

That looks amazing.

408
00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Doesn't that look pretty?

409
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love it, it's very strong on the coffee.

410
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

411
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's beautiful.
-My gosh.

412
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The Swiss meringue buttercream
is like silk.

413
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the level of coffee is spot on.

414
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sponges have compressed a little.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Your cake

416
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-was completely flourless, was it?
-Yeah.

417
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] That's why it's compressed.
-[Paul] Overall, a good job.

418
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Alison] Well done.

419
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much.
-[sighs] Oh.

420
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the hell. [laughs]

421
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That couldn't have gone better really.

422
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It didn't go great.

423
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, Chocolate Week,
I'm not loving all this.

424
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

425
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They said it is not elegant.

426
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I accept that.

427
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just like myself, simple,
that's how I like everything.

428
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prue called it elegant, classy and cool.

429
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can go off skipping into the meadows,
ready for my technical.

430
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. [chuckles]

431
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bye!

432
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>The bakers could practise</i>
<i>their signature bake,</i>

433
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>but have no idea what awaits them</i>

434
00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Welcome back, bakers.
It's time for your technical challenge.

435
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, this challenge has been set
by the princess of puddings,

436
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Prue Leith.
-[chuckles]

437
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do you have any words of wisdom?
-[Prue] Yes.

438
00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When working with the chocolate,
you need perseverance and patience.

439
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As always, this challenge
is judged blind, so, Prue and Paul,

440
00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you may now leave the tent, thank you.

441
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They'll do some gymnastics.

442
00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-Prue's got a pommel horse.

443
00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul's gonna get in his leotard.

444
00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, so Prue would like you to make six
perfectly baked individual cheesecakes.

445
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[softly] Oh.

446
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your cheesecakes must comprise
of a caramelised white chocolate filling

447
00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
on top of an oaty biscuit base.

448
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Topped with a blackcurrant jelly
and white chocolate decoration.

449
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have two hours.

450
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks…
-Get set…

451
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chants] B to the A to the K to the E,
let's bake!

452
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's bake!

453
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison and Noel laughing]

454
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dana] That's not a lot of time

455
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to make a set, baked cheesecake,
so there's a lot of pressure.

456
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] Never made caramelised
white chocolate nor a cheesecake.

457
00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So basically, I'm in the dark here.

458
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue, this looks quite
a complicated technical, is it?

459
00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There are a few hurdles to get over.

460
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The really tricky thing
is caramelising the chocolate.

461
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They need to stick it in the microwave,

462
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and every 30 seconds, give it a stir.

463
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Another 30 seconds, give it a stir,

464
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
until it gets this straw colour.

465
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But don't overdo it.

466
00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] They could burn it.
-Yeah.

467
00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hmm. The fact you've caramelised
white chocolate, it's silky,

468
00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's lovely, luxurious.

469
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm curious to see how they're gonna
deal with this white chocolate.

470
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That could catch the bakers out,
which in turn throws their timings out,

471
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which in turn ends in melting messes
all over the top.

472
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're a gloomy fellow.

473
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both laugh]

474
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Nicky] Instruction number one,

475
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Make the biscuit base
using the rubbing-in method."

476
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I've just combined
the flour and butter.

477
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Cristy] Add the oats.

478
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Two, "Spread the mixture out
on a tray and bake."

479
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want the oats to get a nice colour.

480
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think it's gonna need very much,
just get it a wee bit crisp.

481
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Five minutes and then check.
Blooming hell, it's hot, innit?

482
00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Every time I come to this area,

483
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-my temperature actually goes up.
-[laughs]

484
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do have that effect.

485
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Next, it's move on
to the blackcurrant jelly.

486
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which helpfully says,
"Make blackcurrant jelly." [exhales]

487
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Feeling jelly, jelly. [laughs]

488
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've left some of the blackcurrants whole
for a bit of texture.

489
00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] It's more civilised
to sieve your jelly.

490
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Hello.
-[Rowan] Hi.

491
00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How are you?
-I'm good. I'm gonna squeeze my gelatine.

492
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do you like gelatine?
-No. It's a pig's trotter.

493
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that what it is?
-Basically.

494
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We should all be vegan at this point.
-Are you a vegan?

495
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No. [laughs]
-[laughs] Well, there you are.

496
00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] So now,
pour into the lined tray to set.

497
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's gotta go in the fridge surely.
-I'm getting them out.

498
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Dana] Happy with the biscuit.
-[Rowan] Then give it a blitz.

499
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dana] I'm gonna
get the biscuit base into the mould.

500
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Equal amounts.

501
00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The right amount in each one,

502
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
didn't end up the way I thought it would.

503
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's okay.

504
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Patted it down
so it's gone nice and set. Right.

505
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] Next on the agenda,
caramelising some white chocolate.

506
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Caramelised white chocolate.

507
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know what it is.

508
00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] I've done it before.

509
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can't remember when I did it,
but I have done one.

510
00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] <i>Caramelising white chocolate</i>

I've managed to put a box together.

Bakers, you've just got one minute left.

[Josh] I've got to get
Alison's name piped on the side.

[Rowan] It looks like
my granddad sat on it

1030
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Cristy] Feeling happy.
I've not had a disaster.

-Yes. Take these out.
-Turn these out?

1034
00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Dan] You get cracking. I'll do this.

1035
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please step away

Matty, it's time for your showstopper.

1046
00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think your box
is beautifully engineered,

1047
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but lost all its shine.

1048
00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hmm.
-[Prue] Right, let's get the top off.

1049
00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, now, this is nice and shiny.

1050
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Moulded chocolates are perfectly tempered.

1051
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Inside, it's got
a chocolate genoise sponge

1052
00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with a chocolate crème mousseline,

1053
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Raspberry is delicious.

1054
00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Hmm.
-And the textures are spot on.

1055
00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To put raw raspberries in
often will make it too wet,

1056
00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-you've done it well. Well done.
-Thank you.

-[Paul] What's in the white chocolate?
-[Matty] Lemon mousse.

1058
00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the dark chocolate's pistachio cream.

1059
00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd pay a lot for a box of those.

1060
00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1063
00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] It's so neat and it's so beautiful.

1064
00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wow.
-Oh, that looks amazing.

1065
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Passion fruit
is a good idea because it's glittery.

1066
00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks like jewels.

1067
00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, this is my tropical entremets
consisting of genoise sponge,

1068
00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a coconut dacquoise,
white chocolate mousse,

1069
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
passion fruit jelly with salted caramel
and rum-and-raisin chocolates.

1070
00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. Flavours are wonderful.

1071
00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] They are. Really fresh.

1072
00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's not carrying
a lot of baking in there.

1073
00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's really a dessert.

1074
00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your salted caramel chocolate
is delicious. Got a lovely shine on it.

1075
00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] It's impressive.

1076
00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's more impressive from a distance

1077
00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-'cause you can't see the lack of detail.
-I agree.

1078
00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Pity you couldn't put the legs on.
-They've had a long day.

1079
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] There's not much of a shine
on that cake.

1080
00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cake is delicious.

1081
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the nuts and the caramel,
far too pale.

1082
00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs to be richer in colour
and that brings more flavour.

1083
00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have a look at one of these.

1084
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, we've got cookie dough and pretzel
and an Irish liqueur cream filling.

1085
00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What is that?
-Is that the popping candy?

1086
00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh.
-[Alison] Yeah, I can hear it.

1087
00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very sweet.

1088
00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Not the neatest work you've done.
-[Prue] No.

1089
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've had a mare.

1090
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They're a bit weird in colour,
aren't they?

1091
00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

1092
00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] What's in the blue one?

1093
00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's an orange fondant.

1094
00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ish. There's a hint.
-Okay.

1095
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a chocolate cake with a chocolate
orange Swiss meringue buttercream

1096
00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and orange curd.

1097
00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh, that's delicious.

1098
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The flavour's great,
but it's a bit of a mess.

1099
00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Prue] You know what?

1100
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we came to your house
and had a slice of that,

1101
00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you'd think it was perfect.

1102
00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Er. Mmm, I'd kick off.

1103
00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1104
00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're not invited.

1105
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

1106
00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
You got a box that's not tempered properly
which is why it's lost its shine.

1107
00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you're doing piping like this
you have to be so precise

1108
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that's not precise enough.

1109
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] The piping on this side's good.
It says Alison.

1110
00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's fantastic.

1111
00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sponge is baked beautifully well.
Not carrying a huge amount of flavour.

1112
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's because the hazelnuts
are so strong.

1113
00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would complain that I've got
too many nuts in my mouth.

1114
00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[contestants laughing]

1115
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's try this white one, which is?
-[Josh] White chocolate and vanilla.

1116
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This one's got
caramel chocolate and hazelnut.

1117
00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very nice. Mmm.
-Oh, that's delicious.

1118
00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think this is a little triumph.

1119
00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The box looks amazing.

1120
00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] The tempering is impressive.
-The shine.

1121
00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Shine is fantastic.
-Thank you.

1122
00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Where are all your truffles?
There's just three.

1123
00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Nicky] Yes.

1124
00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They weren't quite all capped.

1125
00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I thought I'll give you three nice ones.
-[Prue chuckles]

1126
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The cake, the meringue,
the nuts in there…

1127
00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is an extremely rich cake.
-Hmm.

1128
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the richness
and I love the flavours.

1129
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Delicious.

1130
00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is in here?

1131
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Salted caramel.

1132
00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Certainly is.

1133
00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Really nice.

1134
00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Who's the third one for?
-You want it?

1135
00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Nicky] Well caught.
-[laughing]

1136
00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I like it.
-Thanks, Nicky.

1137
00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I love the box.

1138
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's perfect.
-Really beautiful.

1139
00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you manage to get it out
without a crack?

1140
00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very good.

1141
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Let's have a look.

1142
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a chocolate cake
with a chocolate and mascarpone filling.

1143
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very chocolatey.

1144
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just think the texture is a bit solid.

1145
00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is. It's a bit dry in the mouth.

1146
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1147
00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] These are nice and shiny.

1148
00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The praline's nice.

1149
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, good.
-[Paul] It's a nice chocolate.

1150
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, coffee's lovely. Both very good.

1151
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] The box structurally is very good.
A nice-looking box.

1152
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a shame the shine's not there
'cause that'd look really good.

1153
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, there's the cricket bat.
Isn't that a perfect cricket bat?

1154
00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've struggled a bit
with the chocolates.

1155
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Paul] Maybe you should've done one type

1156
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
rather than three.

1157
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-[Prue] Let's see what the cake's like.

1158
00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cake is milk chocolate and a pistachio.

1159
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the pistachio flavour.

1160
00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is a bit dry.

1161
00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the flavour, however,
is beautiful.

1162
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Is this one-- Coffee.
-Coffee.

1163
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. Certainly is.

1164
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like that one.
But the chocolate is a bit soft.

1165
00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still pretty delicious.

1166
00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, Saku.

1167
00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much.

1168
00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thanks.

1169
00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Saku] It was far better
than what I thought,

1170
00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I'm done with chocolate.

1171
00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No more chocolate in my life, ever.

1172
00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was a nice way to finish the day off.

1173
00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sun's out, got a result like that.

1174
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm happy with that.

1175
00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know about Star Baker.
But as close to getting it as I have been.

1176
00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel proud of what I presented.

1177
00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think off the back of yesterday,
I could possibly be going home.

1178
00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The stress ride continues.

1179
00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[quacking]

1180
00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, Paul, Prue, how impressed
were you with the showstoppers?

1181
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Matty's cake was one of the best
because it was light.

1182
00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It still tasted chocolatey and delicious.

1183
00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We wanted the chocolate
to be in the cake as well as the box.

1184
00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] Yeah.
-When we did get a chocolate like Nicky,

1185
00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it was really punchy.

1186
00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know about you guys,
but I was happy seeing Dan come back.

1187
00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank goodness for that.

1188
00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This was utterly delicious.

1189
00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But there was hardly any cake in it.

1190
00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The one I was so disappointed
about was Rowan.

1191
00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-His box was a complete mess.
-He was in line for Star Baker.

1192
00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I think it ended up with, for me,
between Nicky and Matty.

1193
00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who needs to be worried today?

1194
00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Definitely Cristy, definitely Saku.

1195
00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Coming into today,
they weren't doing well.

1196
00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And both of them are much of a muchness.

1197
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Saku's was quite dry,
but the flavour was good.

1198
00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cristy's, quite dry,
but the flavour was good.

1199
00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, they're almost identical.

1200
00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The fact that Tasha's not here.

1201
00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have to decide
whether someone should go

1202
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or we leave it for another week.

1203
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's what Prue and I
have to go through again

1204
00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and see where we are.

1205
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll be honest with you. Josh.

1206
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The fact that he used my name,
for me, he's the winner.

1207
00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:39.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need to try that. I guarantee
you'll have a problem with his nuts.

1208
00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison and Noel laughing]

1209
00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Hello, bakers.

1210
00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got the lovely job
of announcing this week's Star Baker.

1211
00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the person
who's Star Baker this week is…

1212
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Matty.

1213
00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Told ya.
-Well done.

1214
00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[applause]
-Well done, mate.

1215
00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unfortunately, I've got the awful job
of announcing who's leaving today.

1216
00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, the baker leaving the tent today is…

1217
00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
None of ya.

1218
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're all staying.

1219
00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, next week,
two bakers will leave the tent.

1220
00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, guys.

1221
00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Dana] Well done, Matty.

1222
00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:38.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so happy.

1223
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am buzzing, yeah.

1224
00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Also, a little bit of a confidence boost.

1225
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You was right. [laughs]
-[Alison laughs]

1226
00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You had this week.

1227
00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This was your week.

1228
00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Matty has been getting better and better.

1229
00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think he really deserves Star Baker.

1230
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Bit better next week, please.
-I will try my best.

1231
