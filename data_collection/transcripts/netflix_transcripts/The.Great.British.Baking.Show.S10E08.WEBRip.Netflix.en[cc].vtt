For your quarter-final
signature challenge,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the judges would like you each
to bake a batch of 12 sweet vol-au-vents.

48
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your vol-au-vents should be made
from beautiful, flaky rough puff pastry

49
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never heard of vol-au-vents before.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

55
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Vol-au-vent is something so from '70s.

56
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's Pastry Week. We've given the bakers
two hours to produce sweet vol-au-vents.

57
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Traditionally, we think vol-au-vent,
we think savoury.

58
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we've put a slight twist on it.

59
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And they're non-savoury.

60
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is sweet vol-au-vent,
another new level.

61
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Puff pastry lends itself
to either sweet or savoury.

62
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The key thing with this challenge
is getting that lamination

63
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and getting that beautiful golden colour
and crisp on the vol-au-vent itself.

64
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The filling must pack a punch.
It can be anything they like.

65
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It needs to be both light,

66
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so they don't spoil
the flakiness of the pastry,

67
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but they need to be flavourful.

68
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the quarter-final
and we're expecting nothing but perfection

69
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
from our five amazing bakers.

70
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abdul] I think with my signatures,
usually I'm calm,

71
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then again, things can still go wrong.
I mean, er, you never know.

72
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is the tent after all.

73
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because this is the quarter-final,
Paul and I will be really ruthless.

74
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean,
we have to have everything perfect.

75
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think at this time in the competition,
any little mistake will be picked on.

76
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll see.

[chuckles] It's in the past now.

80
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's clean slate this week.

So, a pastry case and then inside,
it's gonna be orange and mandarin

84
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

of clove and cardamom

85
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to enhance the flavour
of the orange itself.

86
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's in the vol-au-vent?
Have you got a crème pat or--

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a orange and mandarin cream cheese.

88
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Maxy chuckling] They're not golden yet.

305
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And they're really leaning.

306
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's done

307
00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause I can see the bottom is golden.

308
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Janusz] If it is, remove them.
-[Syabira] All right, I'll take it out.

309
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abdul] The butter is leaking.
It's the first time I'm seeing it leaking.

310
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] They're okay. They're laminated.

311
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Should be fine,
they go to the freezer now.

312
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] It's cooked.

313
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd say…

314
00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
five more minutes,
but that's cutting it short.

315
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't wanna present a raw pastry.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Matthew, if you're a good boy
and you do the time call well,

318
00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you can have a chocolate.

319
00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have 15 minutes.

320
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There you go. Good boy.

321
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Maxy] Fifteen minutes and they're
not even out the oven. [laughs]

322
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look terrible.

323
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're all wonky.

324
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] The butter's just oozing out.

325
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything is lopsided.
There's not even one perfect one.

326
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

328
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just piping some cream
onto my vol-au-vents.

329
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just whipped cream.

330
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think custard worked out
in my head, but not in real life.

331
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going to sprinkle some
praline at the bottom.

332
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause it's going to sit
at room temperature for a while.

333
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just taking out the middle bit now
so I can fill it with the custard.

334
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] They look
like Yorkshire puddings, they do.

335
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Are they a bit flat?
-I'm not happy at all.

337
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-What's with these trousers today?

338
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thought I'd wear leather trousers,
so it's easier to clean.

339
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Show Prue your trousers, she'll forget
about the height of your vol-au-vents.

340
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing] Good luck.

341
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll sit there like that
with my vol-au-vents.

342
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[both laughing]

343
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know what?
I'm just gonna take 'em out.

344
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got no choice.

345
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

346
00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have five minutes left.

347
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[sighs]

348
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] How great do these look?

349
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] I am just gonna pipe it in.

350
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Maxy] I don't know
if I can even put the cream in.

351
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't believe this, honestly.

352
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] Full of ginger. I can smell it.

353
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[gasps] I'm pushing myself
and I'm breaking my shells.

354
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] 'Cause it's warm,
it's just too liquidy.

355
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not good.
It's really, really, really, not good.

356
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[groaning] Oh, my God.

357
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] Hopefully, it will be perfect,

358
00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because if you're doing classics,
you cannot really go wrong on them.

359
00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs in exasperation] Stress.

360
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is so risky. [scoffs]

361
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just the final bits left,
so just pushing myself.

362
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

363
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is up.

364
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Please step away from your bakes.
-[laughs nervously]

365
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] Bit messy.

366
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[inhales deeply] Why?

367
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] Maxy, it's okay.

368
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>It's judgement time</i>

369
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not even a quarter of the height

370
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I expect them to be.
-Mmm-hmm.

371
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Er, so they are very flat and very pale.

372
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The butter leaked as well.
This is the first time it happened.

373
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] There's no butter on there.
It's bone dry.

374
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's okay.
The chocolate solidified round the side.

375
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's so pale and so thin.

376
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's almost just a sheet of puff pastry

377
00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Okay.

378
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've got
too many flavours in there.

379
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because there are too many,
you can't taste anything individually.

380
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it's a bit murky.

381
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bit under-baked and too thin.
-And too complicated. Poor Abdul.

382
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

383
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could we think
of something nice to say? [laughs]

384
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Welcome to the quarter-final.
-Yeah.

385

387
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're all over the place.

388
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] We didn't ask
for a Leaning Tower of Pisa,

389
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've got a burnt biscuit
sitting on top of quite a dark,

390
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
very low vol-au-vent.

391
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavour is amazing,
but it needs to be lighter.

392
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Vol-au-vents should be light and airy.

393
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It melts in the mouth.
-[Sandro] Yeah.

394
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pastry's over-baked.

395
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I think the flavour is fantastic.

396
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't agree
that the ginger biscuit's burnt.

397
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's burnt.

398
00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you think?

399
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here am I trying to help you, Sandro.

401

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite attractive,

404
00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like what you've done
with the glazed strawberries on top.

405
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're uneven.
Probably needed a bit longer in the oven.

406
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're a little pale for a vol-au-vent.
How did you get on with the crème pat?

407
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What crème pat?
-What crème pat?

408
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It never happened.

409
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I take it gloopy.
-It never happened. [laughs]

410
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] So what we have is crème Chantilly?

411
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] Whipped cream.
Strawberries and cream.

412
00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] This is really still raw inside.

413
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit boring because all there is
is cream and strawberry

414
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a pretty dry vol-au-vent.

415
00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] It's a shame, actually,

416
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the crème pat would have worked
if you'd put cream with it.

417
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

418
00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighing] My vol-au-vents

419
00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
decided to go
for a dance in the oven, erm…

420
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They… They're…
You know, they're all over the place.

421
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs nervously]

422
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bit irregular in size.

423
00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bit irregular on height,
a bit irregular on colour.

424
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not very appealing to look at.
-I know.

425
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A bit dry. And quite flat.

426
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, I--
-Expected them to be much higher.

427
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Square's quite difficult to do.

428
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Round is easier,
which is why most vol-au-vents are round.

429
00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think they needed longer bake time.

430
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Were you rushed for time at the end?
-I was.

431
00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's raw at the bottom here.

432
00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really thick band of raw--

433
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Really under-baked, isn't it?
-[Maxy sighs] Sorry.

434
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had a terrible time making them, so…

435
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oddly, I didn't think
both jams would work, but they do.

436
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gooseberry and cloudberry are delicious.

437
00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unfortunately, you get
that overriding flavour of raw pastry

438
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
down at the bottom.

439
00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks, Maxy.
-Thank you. Okay.

440
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[whispering] They like
the flavours, though.

441
00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I knew they were going to be raw.

442
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, gosh.

443
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I like the look of them,
I think they look quite authentic.

444
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And all pretty much the same size as well.

445
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice height. You trapped the butter inside

446
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause you get the height
without lamination on the outside.

447
00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The pastry's <i>just</i> cooked through,

448
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's a little doughy in the middle.

449
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Probably two minutes away
from being perfect.

450
00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What did you put down at the bottom?
-The orange praline.

451
00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gone back to a liquid
'cause it's got liquid on top.

452
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which is nice.
I think the flavours are beautiful.

453
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I really do.
-This is a delicious vol-au-vent.

454
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The custard inside is light.

455
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the pecan praline is just delicious.

456
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've done a nice job with these.
-Thank you.

457
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Well done.

458
00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

459
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul says two minutes from perfect.

460
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I have those two minutes.
I don't. [laughs]

461
00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul says the rise should be four times.

462
00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a bit crazy.

463
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavours were good,

464
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's Pastry Week,
so I do have to be a bit worried,

465
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
seeing as I had an undercooked pastry,

466
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] Paul called it boring.

467
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's strawberries and cream.
You can't go wrong.

468
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But at the same time,
I can understand why it's boring.

469
00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it was just perfectly risen,
I would have got my handshake today.

470
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs sarcastically] I don't even
want it now. Now I don't want it. At all.

471
00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[birds chirping]

472
00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>The bakers have no idea</i>
<i>what they'll be asked to make</i>

473
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

474
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, it's time
for your technical challenge,

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

476
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prue-lio Inglesias!

477
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, we love your music.

478
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, so sexy.
-Yeah.

479
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Even better without the moustache.
-[Matt] Yeah. Agreed.

480
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Will you give us
some words of advice, please?

481
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, there are
29 ingredients in this recipe,

482
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so please get the balance right.

483
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] As ever, the technical challenge
will be judged blind.

484
00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we'll have to ask Prue-lio Inglesias
and Paul Hollywood to leave the tent.

485
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[whispering] They'll probably kiss.
-[Matt] Yeah.

486
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For your technical challenge,

487
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue-lio would like you
to make eight spring rolls,

488
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
featuring a delicate pastry that have been
deep fried to crispy perfection.

489
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And they must be served
alongside a dipping sauce.

490
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have one hour and 20 minutes.

491
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks…
-Get set…

492
00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake.

493
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ay-ay-ay. What is this, mate?

494
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] Right. The deep fryer.

495
00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am quite surprised with spring rolls,
I'm not gonna lie.

496
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
First time making them.

497
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's new thing to do.

498
00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My mom, she used to make them,
but I don't remember much, though.

499
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Should have paid attention.

500
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm trying to figure out what to do.
[laughs] I don't know.

501
00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] So, Prue, spring rolls.

502
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I don't think many
people make spring rolls,

503
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I feel it's a great test.

504
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After all, it is the quarter-final
and it's quite difficult.

505
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pastry's tricky.

506
00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I think we'll have some of the bakers
struggling with huge great bubbles.

507
00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And those bubbles come
because the water's in the pastry.

508
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We haven't told them how much water.

509
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's too wet, the bubbles will be
huge and ugly and misshapen.

510
00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But they should be more like this one,

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

563
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

much filling, it's all pastry.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it's a bit stodgy.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

756
00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got 12 pages

758
00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got a book for my one bake.

759
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is the quarter-final, so you've
gotta give it your absolute best.

760
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The showstopper challenge our bakers
have to face is a storybook pie scene.

761
00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We want the bakers to create a scene
instantly recognisable when we look at it.

762
00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, it could be any nursery rhyme,
any children's story,

763
00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it is down to the bakers,
but the star of this particular challenge

764
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
has to be the crust.

765
00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I cut into the pie,
I wanna see a beautiful thin pastry

766
00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
creating a beautiful buttery flavour
with a filling that packs a punch.

767
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Prue] Can the bakers make
a really good pastry

769
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that properly holds their filling?

770
00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that is all about
not getting the filling too wet,

771
00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which will make for a soggy bottom,

772
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and not have it too stiff
so that it's too dry or hard.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] This is Pastry Week
and to be honest,

774
00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not happy with what
they've created so far.

775
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They should be doing better,
we've got five fantastic bakers.

776
00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is no room for error.

777
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they just crack out
eight perfect pork pies,

778
00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will not be impressed.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

what are you doing?

782
00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, so my pie scene is based
on the book <i>Treasure Island.</i>

783
00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the curry that I'm bringing
is called khatte baingan,

784
00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which means, er, bittersweet aubergine.

785
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>Inspired by his mum's recipe,</i>
<i>Abdul hopes to strike gold this week</i>

786
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>with his</i> Treasure Island <i>theme.</i>

787

<i>He's making a selection</i>

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the pie scene itself
will have an island,

790
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
er, that will be made out of apple
and blackberry crumble tart.

791
00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The idea of the apple as the island,

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-What pastry is that sitting in?

795
00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

two types of pastry,

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Pastry is all right.

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'd fill that with a gelatine.
Basically, this is a sausage roll.

1049
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That apple mixture should be
wetter than that.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the interaction with the crust

1061
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the interior
is where it fails slightly.

1062
00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needed another element,
to wet that mixture down inside.

1065
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1077
00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It looks quite attractive.

1078
00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, you've had a bit of issues
with it cracking here, haven't you?

1079
00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Prue] That's a lot of pie filling.

1080
00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Okay.

1081
00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The pastry's sort of lost
because it's a bit soft.

1082
00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very dry inside.

1083
00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like a sandwich, not a pie.

1084
00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The bottom of it is just raw.

1085
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's look at these cherry.

1086
00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tough as old boots.

1088
00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shame it wasn't an ice cream competition.

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overall, you've lost
your way with this pastry.

1091
00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1092
00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] The star really, for me,
the stars at the moment.

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The half globe has lost
its way a little bit.

1094
00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Start with these?
-Yeah.

1095
00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I like the taste.

1096
00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it needed something with it

1097
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because as it's cooled,
it's turned into a pâté.

1098
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Right.
-[Paul] The globe.

1099
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would've baked that filo for longer.

1100
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Want that flake in a filo.

1101
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think filo was
the wrong choice for that.

1102
00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the cloud.

1103
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Beautifully baked.

1104
00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a nice short pastry
to go with a creamy top.

1105
00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I've got one complaint, I think

1106
00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the ratio of fruit to cream
is a bit wrong.

1107
00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You need more fruit and less cream.

1108
00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But otherwise it's perfect.

1109
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1110
00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispers] Class.

1112
00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] It's clever using this pastry.

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because it's bulletproof
and you can't go wrong.

1115
00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very, very good.
-That's lovely.

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flaky, falls apart,
buttery on the fingers.

1117
00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The filling is spicy,
but still moist and somehow luscious.

1118
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Unctuous.

1120
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Unctuous. That's the word.

1121
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] This is your other pie?

1122
00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chicken rendang pie.

1123
00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pastry thin. Thin, thin.

1124
00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Filling is well-packed.

1125
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a nice-looking pie.

1126
00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, chicken is delicious.

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's all been kept
inside a very neat parcel.

it is a little dry.

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just hope I've done enough to save me.

1136
00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] The ambition was something
that definitely worked against me.

1137
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But they liked my ice cream. [laughing]

1138
00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel a little bit traumatised
because it's the quarter-final.

1139
00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want it to be amazing
and it just wasn't quite--

1140
00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was really disappointing.

1141
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Three out of five of them,
pastry wasn't very good.

1142
00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And all their pies were too dry inside.

1143
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Syabira's was good, clever.
-[Prue] Yeah.

1144
00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Good choice of pastry. When you got into
the pie, it's a beautiful curry inside.

1145
00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And also Abdul's pastry was beautiful.
The aubergine curry was fantastic.

1146
00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you look at Janusz's,
actually they looked great,

1147
00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but where he lost it
is not necessarily his flavours.

1148
00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They were all quite dry.
-Yeah.

1149
00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And big gaps between pie and filling.
-Too much air.

1150
00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Maxy, I loved her chicken.

1151
00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then you looked at the filo half globe.

1152
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The filo wasn't good.

1153
00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overall, she struggled,
and she's not the only one to struggle.

1154
00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sandro, really bad.

1155
00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The actual pie itself wasn't baked enough,

1156
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it was quite raw inside.

1157
00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What he should've done
is a smaller thinner caterpillar.

1158
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know it's a hungry caterpillar,
but it could've been smaller.

1159
00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. I'm quite disappointed.

1160
00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In line for going home…

1161
00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think obviously Maxy

1162
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and for me obviously Sandro.

1163
00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, luckily for me this week,

1164
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have the lovely job
of announcing Star Baker.

1165
00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the person
who is Star Baker this week is…

1166
00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Syabira.

1167
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

1168
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're attached to all of you,

1169
00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and we don't want
to say goodbye to anyone here,

1170
00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I am afraid we do have to say goodbye.

1171
00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:05.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, erm, I'm sorry to say
the person leaving us this week is…

1172
00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maxy.

1173
00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs deeply] Gosh.

1174
00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you guys. [chuckles]

1175
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Well done, Maxy.

1176
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've done really well. Really well.
-[Prue] Oh, Maxy.

1177
00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've been so brilliant honestly.

1178
00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't believe it.

1179
00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had a bad, bad week.

1180
00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew it. I knew it was me.

1181
00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew it was coming,

1182
00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I was hoping
my showstopper would save me.

1183
00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You got through to the quarter-finals.

1184
00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Maxy] I know.
-That's a big thing.

1185
00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's really sad to go, but I'm happy

1186
00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I am proud that I made it this far.

1187
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] You're a lucky boy.
-I know. Yes, I am.

1188
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

1189
00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Couldn't be happier. I've still
got a chance to get to the finals.

1190
00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm through to the semifinals.
How weird is that? [chuckling]

1191
00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stay calm.

1192
00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just go ahead
and give it my best again and then hope.

1193
00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[softly] Please don't cry.

1194
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm trying not to cry.

1195
00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maxy's leaving.
Ah, sad, best buddy. [chuckles]

1196
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] Don't know
if she can cry or laugh.

1197
00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She's like, she's a mix.
-She's torn.

1198
00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry. I feel so confused.

1199
00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know if I want to be happy or cry.

1200
00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sniffles]

1201
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's sad to lose Maxy.

1202
00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's been one of the strongest
bakers coming into today.

1203
00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was very close between Sandro and Maxy.

1204
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sandro's really got to watch it now.

1205
00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Next week is a clean slate.

1206
00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:29.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to fight for the spot
to be in the final,

1207
00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is a dream for me.

1208
00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
