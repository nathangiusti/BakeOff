*David*
-Hello, David.
-Hey, love.
[Prue] It looks like a painting.
I think it looks absolutely lovely.
Nice interior.
[Prue] This is when I'm going to get
this layered taste.
The bottom one is clove, then star anise
and then cinnamon.
[Prue] Mm.
The dominant thing is spice.
Clove, particularly.
It just does not taste as delicious
as it looks.
[Paul] It's been overwhelmed
by the spices.
The meringue is such a beautiful thing...
-It's sort of heartbreaking.
-It is. It is.
-How could you!
-For something so beautiful,
what have you done?
[Sandi] Look what you've done
to my people!
Next time, I'll pare it back.
-Thank you, David.
-[David] Cool. Thank you.
[exhales sharply]

*Priya*
I really think the colour
of the blueberry cream
-is horrible.
-Okay.
[Prue] I know it's partly because
we don't eat a lot of mauve food,
but it is such a particularly
nasty version of mauve.
-[Paul chuckles]
-Wow.
-It doesn't look appetising.
-Yeah.
-Is that Amaretto?
-[Priya] Yeah.
It's a little bit too much.
I think you've slightly overbaked
the meringue.

*Rosie*
I would've liked to have seen a bit more
elaborate piping on the outside.
[Rosie] Yeah.
[Prue] It looks a bit wonky.
It's absolutely delicious.
I think your layers are fantastic.
Got a little bit of sharpness coming
from the curd, the raspberries are nice.
However, the chocolate doesn't go with it
because it's too thick.

*Alice*
It just looks so charming
with your basket handle.
-[Alice laughs]
-[Prue] Very attractive.
[Paul] You've certainly got the colours.
It's quite purple.
-[Paul laughs]
-It was meant to be cherry.
Your chocolate comes through,
but then you're sort of hunting
for another big flavour to come in
and it just doesn't arrive.
[Prue] It's there if you get a cherry,
but I think you needed
a morello cherry
or something with more punch.
-Okay, thank you. Thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you.

*Michael*
Well, it looks very neat,
and I congratulate you
on your little sticks.
[softly] There's too much chocolate.
-What did you say?
-There's too much chocolate
on the outside.
Don't tell him.
[Paul] The meringue's
sweated slightly inside
with it being en croute
almost with the chocolate.
'Cause all the liquid is then soaked
into the meringue
-and it's softened it up.
-Okay.
-Chocolate, it dominates the whole thing.
-[Michael] Okay.
But I have to say, I like the flavours.
They're very obvious,
there's orange and chocolate.
And what's better than that?

*Steph*
It does look beautiful. It's neat.
It's very professional-looking.
[Prue] It's lovely-looking
and quite original.
And it really looks like
a celebration cake.
-[Prue] Oh, that looks gorgeous.
-That looks yummy.
[Paul] The raspberry comes through.
You do get the flavour of the nuts,
but you needed to lighten that out,
just take some nuts out,
-and it would've been much nicer to eat.
-Okay.
It tastes lovely. It looks lovely.
-And there are too many nuts.
-Thank you.

*Henry*
I like the way the meringue
has really risen,
-but it is slightly messy.
-[Henry] It's a little rugged.
[Paul] The one on the top
should've been at the bottom.
The one on the bottom should be
the second from the top.
-[Henry] Yeah.
-[Paul] And then these two
should be inverted and put on top of that.
So that you end up with...
-with a slight rise to the top.
-Yeah.
Design-wise, it's wanting.
[Paul] I like the nutty meringue.
-The texture's great 'cause it's light.
-Oh, lovely.
Raspberry jam is the saviour of this,
because everything seems to flow with it.
-[Prue] Yeah, it's good.
-You didn't make the jam, did you?
-I did.
-You did make the jam?
I did. The cheek.

*Steph*
Steph, please will you bring up
your Showstopper?
[Noel] Do you need a hand?
Probably.
Well, your mirror glaze
has certainly worked.
You've got the beautiful shine
off the mirror
with the lines of the white chocolate
with the brittle.
That is stunning.
[Prue] Let's hope it tastes
as good as it looks.
And so, it's a chocolate mousse,
coffee bavarois.
[Prue] The mirror glaze
is so lovely and thin.
The chocolate mousse
is just what a chocolate mousse should be,
it melts in your mouth.
Bavarois is lovely.
I could just eat that all.
[Paul and Sandi chuckle]
That's one of the best things
I've had to eat for a long time.
[Sandi] Yeah!
The mousse is perfect,
and the coffee with the mousse as well,
which is so light.
It's like you've been doing this
for years, just making bombes.
Well done, Steph. Thank you.

*Rosie*
It certainly looks celebratory,
doesn't it?
I don't think I'd have blowtorched it
because the colour's so vibrant.
-Okay.
-[Prue] It spoils it a little bit.
Oh, my goodness.
There is a base of honey cake,
mango bavarois
and lemon and hibiscus mousse.
[Prue] That is certainly colourful.
Mousse is very fool-like,
rather than mousse.
It's not really smooth.
[Prue] They're all
very interesting flavours,
but I don't think the mango
-goes with the others so well.
-Okay.
It's a bit clumsy.
And the colours are...
It reminds me of Noel.

*David*
[Prue] It's really pretty.
Most elegantly done, and unusual.
[Paul] It's beautiful.
[David] The base is
a lemon and pistachio Génoise,
then it's a raspberry-and-rose jelly,
then it's a lemon-and-shiso sorbet,
topped with a raspberry
and white chocolate mousse.
[Prue] Perfect layers.
Mmm.
I've never had shiso in this form
and I can't really taste it,
but the lemony flavour is fantastic.
Try it with that.
[all chuckling]
[Paul] The sorbet's delicious
because it is so sharp.
It hits you right at
the back of the tongue.
Jelly's a little bit too rubbery.
Drop it on the floor, it'd probably
bounce back up and hit me in the face.

*Michael*
Michael, please bring up your Showstopper.
Wow. [chuckles]
It looks like something
straight from a 1970s sweet trolley.
[chuckles]
[Prue] It looks like the Queen Mum's hat
or something.
[laughs]
But let's see what this is like inside.
So, it's got a chocolate mousse,
a cherry jelly and a cherry cheesecake.
Wow.
Michael, the cheesecake is, erm, running.
I don't know whether
it's just not had time to set
-or you didn't have the mixture right.
-Okay.
It does taste like a Black Forest gateau.
The almond kicks in.
Really like the jelly,
which has got terrific punch.
[Paul] I think you've done
a great job with the flavours.
I think the overall look is a bit...
-A bit gaudy.
-Okay.

*Alice*
-Beautiful.
-[Prue] Very beautiful.
It looks as you would expect it to look.
It's tiramisu colours.
The sort of deliberate unevenness
of the steps are just perfect.
[Paul] I just hope that coffee is there
and all the beautiful
-textures are in there as well.
-[Prue] And the rum.
A lot of rum, yeah. [chuckles]
It is a layer of mocha mousse,
coffee-soaked génoise sponge,
a pistachio-praline parfait.
The layers are beautiful and delicate,
and it's held together nicely.
Mmm, it's beautiful.
It's delicate, the coffee
is beautiful with the sponge.
-It's lovely.
-[chuckles]
The pistachio comes through
as a bit of texture as well.
The whole thing's a triumph.
-You've made a tiramisu bombe. Well done.
-Thank you.
Thank you, Alice.

*Priya*
Priya, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper?
I think it does look quite elegant.
The colours are nicely laid out.
So, I've got summer berry bavarois
and a chocolate mousse, raspberry sponge.
The sponge is actually baked beautifully.
-It's still light, which is nice.
-[Prue] Mmm.
Nice chocolate mousse.
My only quarrel with the whole thing was
that the chocolate mousse is very sweet.
The raspberry is not.
-It doesn't hold up against the chocolate.
-Okay.
I think if you can instruct diners to eat
first the bavarois and then the mousse,
they'd be happy,
but not the other way around.
Okay.
[Paul] Thank you, Priya.


Henry, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?
[Prue] It's very simple, very elegant.
-It looks like an igloo.
-Igloo.
Okay. [chuckles]
[Paul] That's been scorched.
[Henry] Inside, it's a cinnamon sponge,
and there are two layers
of a slightly-spiced honey mousse,
and one layer of Bramley apple mousse.
Hmm.
The cake's a bit tough.
Hunting down the apple.
If you don't get the apple,
-all you get is cinnamon.
-Right.
You needed something else in there as well
'cause it's a bit bland.
And the cake is very stodgy.
Sort of disappointing.


This was heaven.
But they started so badly with
the meringues that I was despairing,
-but anyway, they've pulled themselves up.
-[chuckles]
But I tell you what I found
most disappointing,
this is a baking competition,
and both Rosie and Henry
made dreadful cakes.
Coming into this, Priya and Michael
were in a little bit of trouble,
and I think Rosie, and certainly Henry,
has fallen into that situation
where you end up with four people,
you've got Priya, Michael,
Henry and Rosie are all in trouble.
The two moments when Prue most went "yum",
was the tiramisu by Alice, and Steph's.
Well, Steph set the bar pretty high.
I thought you were gonna
give her a handshake.
It was perfection.
-[Noel] Right.
-I would say the same about Alice's.
But Alice came first in Technical.
I think both those two guys
are in line for Star Baker.
[Prue] What about David?
Could he not get Star Baker?
I mean, he came second in Technical,
and this is absolutely lovely.
The only trouble is the jelly.
-The jelly was tough.
-Jelly was terrible.
Even I can make jelly.
How do you make bad jelly?
By putting too much gelatine in.
You'd probably use a packet
where it's all measured up for you.
-How dare you!
-[all laughing]
And suspended fruit in it as well
at your birthday.
-How dare you tell the truth!
-This is unbelievable.
Well done, bakers.
That's the end of dessert week.
I don't think I've ever heard
Prue say "yum" quite so many times,
so well done.
Er, it's my privilege and pleasure
to announce the Star Baker.
Star Baker this week is...
-Steph.
-[clapping]
[Alice] You're so good, girl.
You. You.
Well done.
Doing it for the fringes.
Oh, bakers, unfortunately,
that means I've got the horrible job
of announcing the person who's going home,
and this gets tougher and tougher.
The person who's leaving us
this week is...
-Priya.
-[whispers] Oh.
[Priya] Oh.
Girl.
Oh.
[sighs]
Oh, I've learnt so much, Paul.
I have. I've learnt so much.
It's felt like such a privilege
to be in the tent and...
[sighs and stutters]
I want to make sure...
Of course I'm gonna cry.
Of course I'll cry.
But I left work a year ago,
and I was kind of a bit stuck,
and I thought, "I'm just
gonna do the things that I enjoy."
And do you know what it's meant?
It's meant to me that...
if you just start with the things
that you really enjoy, you can't go wrong.
God, I need to give her
a massive, massive hug now.
I spent the past hour before that
prepping my little goodbyes.
I was fully prepped.
I knew what I was gonna nick
from the tent.
I knew I was gonna nick the apron,
I was gonna get a spoon,
maybe a bowl, a whisk.
I think I was definitely flirting
with the bottom there, wasn't I?
Giving the bottom
a cheeky wink. [chuckles]
-[Prue] Well done, little Steph.
-[Steph] Thank you.
-[Prue] You can't go on doing this.
-I know.
[sputters]
I was convinced that
Alice would've had that then.
I'm just like, "Oh, what?"
Hopefully now, three times in a row,
maybe it'll sink in how great she is.
[indistinct conversations]
-[Steph's mum over phone] Hello?
-[Steph] Hi, Mum.
Erm, I just got Star Baker again.
-Oh, my God, Steph.
-I know.
-Bloody hell!
-Stop swearing!
-Sorry! [laughs]
-[laughs]
