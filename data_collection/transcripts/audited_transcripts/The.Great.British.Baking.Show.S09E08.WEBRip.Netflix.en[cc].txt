*Lizzie*
They're a little uneven. Rather huge.
[Paul] You've lost
a bit of the definition in the cuts.
[Prue] I think you could've forgotten
about telling us about the dogs
because they've disappeared.
Actually, I love the texture.
It's very dry and very crumbly.
I didn't think I was going to like it.
[snickers] I do.
There is a chocolatey hint to it,
which is slightly bitter,
which marries it beautifully
with the ice cream.
It's got a nice vanilla kick in it,
but you've got that praline as well.
I would've blitzed that really small
and folded that through
so you'd have ended up
with a bit more praline in your mouth.
What you do get is very good,
it's just messy.
-Which is normal for you, isn't it?
-Yeah.
[all chuckle]
But I think your flavours
and consistency are good.
-Ta.
-Thanks, Lizzie.
Thanks, guys.

*Chigs*
-They are beautiful, Chigs.
-Thank you.
[Prue] Really beautiful.
-Very professional looking.
-[Chigs] Thank you.
[Prue] Look at that. Neat as a pin.
-The mango. Needs lots more.
-[Chigs] Mmm-hmm?
I think canned mango pulp
would have been better.
Not a lot of flavour
coming from the biscuit.
-[Chigs] Okay.
-Erm…
Great texture, though.
The ice cream,
you do get the mango very subtly.
You do get that coconut as well.
But it's not going to last long,
it is very sorbet-like.
But, over all, it is nice. The ice cream
just needs more of a punch.
Okay. Thank you, guys.

*Jurgen*
Did you rest them before you baked them?
I didn't, because the Italian meringue
took so long to cool down.
The whole thing about a macaron
is the resting that creates the skin
which creates the dome,
which you do not have.
-Therefore, you end up with that.
-Yes.
[Prue] But you might have invented
something which is very suitable.
This is very chewy.
I like it.
-Chewy and almondy.
-[Jürgen] Mmm-hmm.
The nuts, you do get beautifully,
but the ice cream's the star here.
-Thank you.
-It's fantastic.
-Intense flavour of bananas.
-[Prue] Mmm-hmm.
-I think that's lovely.
-Hmm.
-Really good, Jürgen.
-Thank you very much.

*Crystelle*
[Prue] Delicious.
It's a nice-looking, very uniform set.
[Prue] I absolutely agree.
It looks tempting and I want one.
[Crystelle chuckles] Good.
I think the flavour is absolutely lovely.
The texture of the ice cream
is a bit light and wet.
-That--
-I actually really like it. Yeah.
I've never had anything like that before.
No, the tahini in the biscuit
is akin to a sort of shortbread.
And the sesame comes through quite nicely.
Coffee levels
are perfect in the ice cream.
It is very flavoursome
and it holds on the tongue as well
which blends quite well.
I think you've done a good job.
I think you've done a really nice job.
-Well done, Crystelle.
-[Paul] Hmm. Thank you.

*Giuseppe*
[Prue] I think they look lovely.
Very interesting. It's almost got a--
[Paul] Looks like a craquelin. Yeah.
I think you've managed
pretty consistent shapes.
Let's have a look.
You said this is made with tofu?
Yes, this is made with tofu and soymilk.
[Prue] It's definitely not
as creamy as I thought it would be.
But the flavour is lovely.
Mmm, texture's fantastic.
It's a very short crispy biscuit, which,
just on its own, would be delicious.
But the ice cream is great.
The orange comes through, cooked through.
You do get a hit of the ginger as well.
[Prue] Oh,
the whole thing is just delicious.
You've done a great job with that.
I would love that just bashed up
in a bowl with a spoon and eat the lot.
[Prue] It's lovely.
-[Paul] Very clever.

*Crystelle*
Crystelle, would you like to bring
your Showstopper up here?
[murmuring nervously] Gotta go for it.
Try not to walk like an idiot.
[Paul] It's a great-looking cake.
[Prue chuckles] It's quite witty, too.
I like the little bodice.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Shall we see inside?
[Paul] Love the roses.
-Think you've done a great job with that.
-Thank you.
[Prue] Mmm. I love the texture.
-It's quite nutty and moist.
-Mmm-hmm.
[Paul] You wouldn't know
it's a gluten-free cake at all.
[Prue] No. The bake is beautiful.
It's the whole coating and the icing
go beautifully with the sponge.
If I have one criticism,
I think that it's very heavy
on the buttercream.
[Paul] But you need that
against the cardamom.
[Prue] If you get
a mouthful like that… [chuckles]
Oh, I don't know, I like that.
-[all laughing]
-You'd be perfectly happy with it.
[Paul] I think you've done a great job.
-Well done. Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

*Giuseppe*
[Prue] Very neat. Very beautiful.
[whispering] I don't know.
It's the top, it's just
a little bit awkward for me.
It hides a lot when you pipe like this.
Oh, okay.
My cake is inspired to the flavours
of the Black Forest,
that is, cherry, chocolate and, uh, cream.
It's actually a bit gluey.
Kirsch and the cherries are very strong.
[Paul] The cherries are pretty sporadic.
The sponge is quite stodgy.
-Is this a Chantilly?
-[Giuseppe] Yes.
I would have done an Italian meringue.
That would've worked beautifully well.
Underwhelmed.
-[Prue] Mmm.
-Mmm.
I expected better from you.

*Chigs*
I do think it looks great.
-Thank you.
-You got good drops
on your naked cake down at the bottom.
The colour's worked.
It's a nice job. It looks like a crown.
There's a lot of detail in it.
It's really impressive, isn't it?
[Paul] Let's see if we can chop
into this bad boy, shall we?
[Prue] The layers are lovely and distinct.
-I love it.
-[chuckles]
It's spot-on.
It's a great chocolate sponge.
And, actually, you've got
a lot of buttercream in there.
-[Prue] Mmm.
-But it works.
Cream-cheese frosting again,
that's, like, cooling on the tongue.
That's a nice cake.
I can't fault it. I think it's lovely.
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Great job, Chigs.
-Thank you very much.
-Well done.
Who knew right at the beginning
that you could produce that
in the quarter finals?
I know. Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.

*Jurgen*
I would have never known
that was a chocolate cake.
[Prue laughs]
I think it looks absolutely beautiful.
[Paul] The whole effect
with the drips you've got
are all perfect and so is the piping.
-[Prue] Oh, that looks so beautiful.
-[Noel] Wow!
That apricot with the chocolate sponges
is beautiful. It's really nicely baked.
-It's not dry at all.
-[Jürgen] Mmm-Hmm.
I also think the buttercream
is beautifully light.
-Thank you very much.
-[Paul] Well done.
-[Matt] Well done.
-[Noel] Well done, Jürgs.
-[Paul] Matches his T-shirt.
-[Prue] Yeah. [chuckling]
-[laughing]
-[Prue] Ombre T-shirt.
[sighs, whispering]
Well done. Really good.

*Lizzie*
This is my celebration of being different.
I mean, that is just amazing.
And the rice paper offshoots
are just so beautifully done.
Look at the tiny little
letters and numbers.
I love it. It reminds me of something
from the cartoon The Yellow Submarine.
I've never seen a cake like it.
I don't think any of us have.
So, it's a lime Swiss meringue
and a coconut cake with pineapple jam.
You really need to eat
the buttercream with it
because the pineapple is very strong
and there's a lot of it.
I do get a hint of the lime.
And you need that in there.
You've got the coconut
in the sponge as well,
which you can taste.
-[Prue] Yes, the coconut's good.
-And you've got the pineapple.
I'd have that on my 40th any day.
When it eventually comes round.
-[laughing]
-[Lizzie] Okay. [chuckles]
-[Prue] I think it's wonderful.
-We asked for exquisite and finesse.
And we got it.
I knew you could do it.
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Ta.



Wow. The world has turned upside down.
Four extraordinary Showstoppers
and Giuseppe didn't really impress you.
-The middle was no good at all.
-[Paul] It was stodgy.
But I think, ultimately,
Giuseppe was in a strong position anyway.
Giuseppe had done enough prior
to these two challenges to save himself.
-Yeah. I think Giuseppe's safe.
-What about Jürgen?
Those layers of the white,
milk and dark chocolate.
-Clever.
-And they were beautifully done.
-It was a delicious cake.
-So he's gotta be in line for Star Baker.
Absolutely. And I think Jürgen stepped up,
but he's not the only one.
Chigs. The cream cheese frosting,
the buttercream,
the sponge itself.
-Beautiful.
-[Prue] This was a faultless cake.
Well, let's talk about Lizzie's.
She made a cake and a pet
at the same time.
The time she spent, you know,
creating that bear rug,
we all knew she could come up
with something with finesse.
-I think she's done it.
-It's a complete triumph.
Now, Crystelle came into today in trouble.
Did she do enough with her Showstopper?
Problem is,
everybody else has done the same.
They've all done really well.
But Crystelle and Lizzie
are absolutely neck and neck.
I think you've got to look at it,
generally, as bakers,
which one deserves their place
in the semi final?
Well, bakers, you have made the judges'
lives quite difficult this week
because all five of you
are terrific bakers
and all five of you have had moments
of real excellence in the tent this week.
But we do have to separate you.
And I'm lucky in that
I have the job of telling you
which one of you
is going to be Star Baker.
I'm delighted to say
that Star Baker this week is…
Chigs.
-Well done.
-[Crystelle] Well done!
I've got the horrible job of announcing
the person who's going home.
And, as Matt said, it was so close.
You've all been so fantastic.
The person who's leaving us is…
Lizzie.
[voice breaking] No. No. No. No.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
[Crystelle sobbing]
[both sobbing]
I feel really proud of myself.
I'm really happy. Oh, God. [chuckles]
I was so overwhelmed to even get here
and now I'm, like, a quarter finalist.
And now I'm dead Scouse 'cause I'm crying.
-[Crystelle] Bloody Technical Challenges.
-You were so good.
Thanks. Oh, God. [chuckles]
[Lizzie] It's such an amazing experience,
oh, to, like, meet the people
that I've met and, like,
learn everything.
[sighs]
[Paul] You did really well.
It's really sad to see Lizzie go,
someone from my neck of the woods.
She's been a bit up and down
over the weeks,
but, actually, this week,
she did really well.
The problem was she came up with an ace
when everybody else did as well.
I am proud of myself.
It's, like, happy tears.
I can't wait to go and walk my dog,
to be honest.
[all laughing]
[Chigs] I can't believe
I got a Star Baker.
Getting one was brilliant,
but getting two? Wow!
It feels good
and I just get more
and more confident week on week.
[Crystelle] Semi final
of The Great British Bake Off.
I don't think
it's going to sink in for a while.
[sighs]
Semi finals! [laughing]
