-Hello, Antony.
-Hello, you guys.
Fascinating looking biscuit.
Those colours are incredible.
Brilliant, they are quite psychedelic.
Love that.
[Prue] I think they look like little
modern art, they're so pretty.
[Noel] Prue, you just like them
'cause they match your outfit.
You know what? That texture is beautiful.
Melts in your mouth.
And that chilli jam blends
gorgeously with it.
-Thank you, Paul.
-That's a, that's a great biscuit.
Boom!
-I'll take that.
-Absolutely. Simply wonderful.
I have to take one away with me.
Yes.
Well done.

*Karen*
[Paul] I think your piping work
is beautiful. It does look amazing.
[Prue] Nice and spicy. Very chewy.
I don't like the texture.
It's like a very, very small cookie.
It didn't blow me away.
Well, I'll take a lot back
from that anyway. That's it.

*Kim-Joy*
They are absolutely exquisite.
-Aw!
-I just love them.
[Paul] Beautifully balanced biscuit,
you break into it and then it instantly
starts to melt in your mouth
and the beautiful flavours come out.
There's enough acidity from the orange
to make your mouth water.
Well done.

*Jon*
[Paul] It looks quite pale.
I do think it is a tiny bit under baked.
It's quite bland.
It is down to the bake,
it needs another three, four minutes.
Cheers.

*Manon*
First of all, they are extremely neat.
I like the look of them.
[Prue] Ooh, very nice.
[Paul] The biscuit is beautifully baked.
It melts in the mouth, it's buttery.
I love chocolate and I love hazelnut,
so you just ticked two boxes there for me.
That's a fantastic biscuit.
[Manon] Thank you.
Would be nice with a glass of milk too.
-Well, it's there.
-Well done.
-Well done.
-Thank you very much.
-[Prue] Good.
-Thank you.

*Rahul*
[Noel] I like this,
it's like owl feathers.
-But it has a lot of flavours in it.
-[Rahul] Yeah, it has.
I don't think the fennel
has quite the punch you thought it has.
-Okay. Yeah.
-[Paul] Thank you.

*Ruby*
[Paul] The reason why you've got 25?
I'm bad at maths.
Do you know, they taste a bit dry.
[Paul] It's like a dried sponge
rather than a biscuit.
It's very difficult to eat.
Okay. Do you want to taste the tea, Paul?
Yeah, that's wet. They're dry.
Great. Phew.

*Dan*
[Paul] They are quite pale looking.
That is tough.
Is it?
[Prue] It's a bit chewy.
[Paul] That's not a shortbread.
It needed longer in the oven.
The flavours are great.
And that jam's delicious.
Just don't like eating it?
Everything else terrible. Thank you.

*Terry*
[Paul] Hello, Terry.
[Terry] Hello, Paul.
Right, okay, this is interesting. Um...
Not my finest hour.
The lamb is not good, is it?
Love it, it's like a Warhol print.
Yeah. I don't like the colour,
I don't like the look of them.
They are not neat enough for me.
Yeah.
[Paul] Right.
They are a little bit hard. Great flavour.
It's just that, you know,
the execution is a bit of a mess.
[laughing]
It's a rough old biscuit, that one.
Never mind.
-Thank you, Terry, thank you.

*Luke*
[Paul] I think they look great.
They look like a proper gingernut.
Hmm, ginger's lovely. Just right.
The lime, however, it just isn't there.
It does need a bit more lime. Nice though.
You can breathe now.

*Imelda*
[Paul] They look very neat.
[Imelda] I'm scared.
-[Paul] Break well.
-Okay.
That's a delicious biscuit.
Very oaty.
-Yeah, feels healthy. Well done.
-No, it's not.
-Thank you.
-But it is worth the calories.
Absolutely. [laughs]
[exhales]

*Briony*
[Paul] Hi, Briony.
[Briony] Hello.
-Looks good.
-Thank you.
And they are pretty uniform
in colour and size.
They're very neat.
I certainly like the scalloped edges.
I think that looks beautiful.
Right.
The shortbread is really
melt-in-the-mouth and crumbly.
What do you think about the egg yolk?
I think it's probably the best shortbread
here today.
-I'm gonna try.
-Oh good.
[Paul] It's a crumbly, soft,
buttery biscuit
and then that bite
which comes from the apple,
the cider, and the caramelisation
on the top, the sweetness,
it just blows your mind.
It's a great biscuit, that.
-Oh, thank you.
-Well done.
Really good.

*Dan*
Dan, please bring up your biscuit selfie.
[Paul] Artistically it's great,
colourful, three-dimensional.
I question the baby though.
It looks like a massive prawn.
[all laughing]
[Prue] I think the colours are fantastic.
The palm trees are definitely
swaying in the wind.
You can feel the heat.
Certainly get the passion fruit.
I get the almond in there as well.
It's delicious, the blend between the two.
It's a nice biscuit.
-The biscuit is excellent.
-Phew.
You've done a great job.

*Kim-Joy*
[Prue] I think it's amazing.
You can see immediately it's sunset
I think you've done a really great job.
The colours are really well-balanced.
Could do with a tiny bit more spice.
-I thought so, yes.
-But it's very nice.

*Luke*
It has a Vegas feel about it.
I love the depth.
[Paul] It's, it's not very often you get
cinnamon and orange together
-and it works.
-[exhales]
I think the biscuits a bit under baked.
[Paul] The biscuit is a bit soft.

*Antony*
Very neat, very precise.
You can see it's you.
Well, it's certainly gingerbread.
You've got a gorgeous balance
between the cinnamon and the ginger.
Really good.

*Jon*
There's some lumpy lemon curd there.
Yeah, it went slightly wrong.
-Lumpy sun.
-Got a little bit overcooked.
The flavours are absolutely lovely.
[Paul] I love that chocolate
with that orange and cinnamon
and that biscuit is spectacular.

*Rahul*
Rahul, would you like to bring up
your biscuit selfie, please?
Well, you've certainly succeeded
with this explosion of the English spring,
and I'm fascinated by your portrait.
[Paul] Where's the stubble on the face?
Oh, that was like seven and a half
years ago.
I was clean shaved at that time.
So, I'm taking it back.
[all laughing]
[Prue] I think
it's definitely recognisable.
Nice and short, isn't it?
Hmm.
[Paul] The ginger comes through
beautifully in a well-baked biscuit.
That, with the design that you've done,
even your little chubby face,
it's fantastic.
I think you've done a great job.
[Sandi and Noel] Well done.

*Karen*
You look like a cross
between Dame Edna and Sue Pollard.
That's been said a few times.
-[Paul] Oh really? Oh right.
-Yes.
Can't get the rosewater.
Really?
[Paul] You get the cardamom
a little bit but very...
You definitely can't get the rosewater.
Got scared with the bottle
and obviously didn't put enough in.
[Paul] It's a shame 'cause it looks great
but you expect a little bit more
kick to it, you know.
A bit more oomph to it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

*Imelda*
[Prue] It's quite simple.
I'm trying to recognise you
in that picture.
I suppose you could say, yeah, it is.
[Prue] You can't eat her.
He's just going to chop your head off now.
Paul, it looked like
you enjoyed that a bit too much.
The biscuit's a little bland,
quite thick
and a little dry.
It's a bit like a stale shortbread.
You get the lemon, you say ginger as well?
Definitely not getting the ginger.
-Okay.
-Thank you.

*Ruby*
I can see what you were trying to do.
-Yeah, was too, too ambitious.
-I think it was too much.
[Prue] All that work has meant
-that you didn't finish yourself.
-Yeah.
And this is supposed to be a selfie
and it's supposed to be recognisable
and I don't think it quite is.
[Paul] Okay, let's try this biscuit now.
-Its cinnamon and ginger.
-Yeah.
It's a strange taste of ginger.
You, you do get the cinnamon
and it's almost like they are fighting
each other for supremacy.
-Right.
-The biscuit's a bit soft.
A little bit dry.
-[Prue] It's not the best ginger biscuit
-Oh, you guys.
I've ever eaten.
It's a shame you didn't finish it.

*Briony*
Love the colours on it
and your portrait really works as well.
I love the balloons, can we eat a balloon?
Yeah, please do.
[Prue] Nice thin icing. I like that.
I would like to have
had more flavour in there.
Okay.
It's a nice biscuit,
just needed more of a punch.
Okay.
That's good.

*Manon*
Excellent.
Thank you.
So detailed and so neat.
It's just exquisite.
I was nervous that the matcha
would be overpowering
but it's not at all, it's just a hint.
Wow.
The biscuit is delicious
but the balance of flavours and textures,
I think you've done,
I think you've done an amazing job.
-Thank you.
-Well done.
-Thank you, Manon.
-Really good.

Terry, please bring up
your biscuit selfie.
Ingenious.
[Prue] I think your face is brilliant.
I've got chocolate, brandy snap,
buttercream and jam.
It's absolutely delicious.
Lovely.
[Paul] It's quite tricky to work
with brandy snap in that sort of size
but to manage to get that
3D mould of your face,
and then the colour in there as well,
I think the whole thing is very clever.
-Well done, Terry.
-Thank you, Paul.
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.
Well done, Terry.
