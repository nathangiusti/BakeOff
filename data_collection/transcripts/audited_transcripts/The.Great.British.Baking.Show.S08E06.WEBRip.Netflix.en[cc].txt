*Hermine*
You needed bigger eyes
for the pandas. [chuckles]
-Panda-ish.
-[Prue] They're nearly even.
[Paul] It's a little untidy
on the shaping.
You know, on the side,
but they're not bad.
[Prue] It's not dead in the middle.
It's mainly bread.
There's an arch there of flavour.
I love it. I think the bread is just…
It's soft,
but it's a bit chewy, which is lovely,
and the filling is just delicious.
Thank you.
It is very good. It's full of flavour.
It packs a punch in the bit
that you do have.
The bun is beautifully baked.
The shaping could've been a bit neater,
but the flavour is very, very good.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
[Prue] Lovely.

*Mark*
Well, you've managed to achieve
a nice, smooth top, actually.
Bit of a shine. You've got
some sesame, some have fallen off.
That one there has got a very vague "P"
-'cause it doesn't have gherkins in it.
-[Paul] Ah.
-I love sesame seed.
-Ah, sorry, I wanted to make sure.
[Prue] Nice filling. It's in the middle.
[Paul] It's got a nice bready look.
[Prue] Good flavour.
The burger bit is quite dry.
A bit of mayonnaise, tomato ketchup
in there would've softened it a bit,
but actually, the taste is good,
and the bun is very, very good.
It's slightly chewy.
You've got that smooth top.
-[Prue] It's nice and soft.
-It is baked all the way through.
-[Prue] It's good.
-[Paul] Simple but effective.
Thank you very much.

*Laura*
[Paul] You've had issues with the dough.
It's seeping through a lot.
You probably have too much filling.
That's what it looks like.
They're all a bit irregular,
but that's down to the filling.
You can see the arch,
which I don't mind,
but you can see why it's broken through.
-[Laura] Yeah.
-[Paul] It's so close to the outside,
it was always gonna burst through,
but your bread looks good.
-[Prue] That looks really good bread.
-[Paul] Mmm.
-[Prue] Smells fantastic.
-Tastes lovely. It's a bit dry,
-but it tastes beautiful.
-Flavour's wonderful.
The meat is tough. The bit of sticky sauce
is lovely, but you need more of it.
Very, very dry. But very, very beautiful.

*Marc*
-[Prue] They look absolutely lovely.
-Thank you.
-They obviously touched in the steamer.
-Yeah.
That's because they're so big.
I think they are too big.
-You've lost the shape a bit.
-Yeah.
[Paul] The colour and decoration
look good.
-[Marc] Thank you.
-Right down to the bottom on the filling.
It tastes great.
It's a lentil dhal, is it?
Yes, lentil and apple.
But you've still got a bit of bite
in the apple, which is unusual.
The paprika works really well
with the curry going through the middle.
It hasn't overwhelmed it.
You are carrying flavour.
-My only issue is the size.
-[Marc] Yeah.
I don't mind them being too big.
But then, I'm greedy.

*Dave*
They look great.
I love the addition of the colour.
-You've got a bit of marking on there.
-[Dave] Yeah.
-[Paul] Filling tried to push through.
-[Prue] It's coming through.
-Very neat and bold.
-In spots.
Well-shaped. Nice and shiny. Smooth.
-You have this arch again, of flavour.
-[Dave] Yes.
I love the chicken.
And the texture's great.
Bun, the bread is lovely.
-Either I needed more filling or…
-[Dave] Yeah.
-…a bit stronger. More curry, really.
-[chuckling] Yeah.
I think they are very good
and you've managed to get the flavour
in the arch all the way through.
That's delicious.
-My only gripe is it's coming through.
-[Dave] That's what I don't like.
-[both] Thank you.
-Cheers.

*Peter*
[Paul] These creases are air pockets
that have shrunk back in.
That's to do with the way
that you've tightened the ball up.
But they do look round,
-beautifully aromatic.
-[Prue] Mmm.
The problem is
you've not tightened it up round the meat.
So it's pulled away
and what you're left with…
is very little dough.
There's more meat than there is dough.
-[Peter] Too much filling.
-Yeah.
That tastes absolutely wonderful.
I love the flavour.
Your flavours are great.
Just watch the buns.

*Lottie*
This one's for Paul.
-[Paul] Okay.
-It doesn't have gherkins in the relish.
[Paul] They all seem similar in size.
Bit of decoration is nice.
That looks like a burger, doesn't it?
It does. Bacon, cheese, burger and relish.
-Just has to taste good now.
-[chuckles]
It's like having a burger, a dry burger
but nevertheless a burger.
-The flavour is spot on.
-[Prue] Hmm, it went in raw?
-Yeah.
-[Paul] Hmm.
I think it's difficult to do
if it's steaming,
get it cooked on the outside
and still rare in the middle.
[Paul] You need more fat in the meat.
But the flavour's excellent.
The way the bun wraps around the filling…
-Beautiful bun.
-[Prue] It's beautiful.
-[Paul and Prue] Well done.
-Thank you.

*Peter*
[Prue] All right.
[Peter] There we go.
He's a shuttlecock called
Dizzy the Shuttlecock.
It's just been hit on the head
and it's got a wee bump.
I think it looks great.
I think it's absolutely lovely.
It's funny, it's cute,
it's slightly mad.
[Paul] Okay, let's have a look shall we?
-[Prue] Oh, my goodness.
-[Noel] Wow.
[Prue] I've never had
a cake with that texture.
-Really delicious.
-[Paul] It's a hell of a chew,
but that's the style.
It needs more of a punch
because the sponge stays
in your mouth for so long.
Not for me, the right taste of flavours.
Thank you.

*Dave*
I think you've got the theme of it,
and you've got that Japanese feel.
Creases are a bit of a letdown,
because you wanna see it
really nicely done all the way down.
You managed to achieve good layers
and they're all straight, all the same.
You've got no concertina in there at all.
Which is really impressive
because they were very big cakes.
I'm really surprised.
I wouldn't have thought
rosewater and matcha would be
a good combination but they are.
It works beautifully with
the buttercream and apple,
and what impresses me
is the sponges are baked really well.
You've done a decent job
with the flavours and overall look.
Cheers, thank you.

*Lottie*
-[Prue] It jiggles. [chuckles]
-[Paul] It does.
[Prue] I love the concept.
[Paul] I thought
the head would be a bit more
but considering it's a delicate cake,
you've managed to get it
to go in a little bit.
-That's stunning.
-[Prue] Very good.
[Paul] That's really good.
-That sponge is amazing.
-[Prue] Perfect texture.
-Very good flavour.
-[Lottie] Thank you.
Last time I had a sponge like that,
I was in Japan.
-Well done.

*Hermine*
This is charming but it ain't cute.
[Paul] That tree
is quite menacing, actually.
[all laugh]
[Paul] The blossom needed another
colour, and the tree, sort of stumpy.
Your fondant's a little bit thick.
And the buttercream's very thick.
It's a shame. The flavours are great.
And you have a lovely genoise, as well.
You are a very good French baker. [laughs]
There's just not, for me,
enough Japanese-ness about this cake.

*Marc*
[Prue] I think you've done
a fantastic job.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] It just looks amazing.
[Paul] You can see the character.
It's professional.
You expect to see that
in a bakery for sure.
-Let's have a look inside.
-[Prue] Yeah.
[Matt] Ooh, look at that.
There's a bit of concertina
in here on the second one.
-But the top one's light.
-[Prue] It looks beautiful.
It's very strange because
the tahini is quite strong.
-Mmm.
-It's a surprise.
[Marc] Yeah.
But I quite like it.
The ginger and lemon
work really well together.
You know,
as the two king flavours in there.
Thank you, Marc.

*Laura*
It is like a character that
you see all over the place in Japan.
And it is very cute.
I sort of feel you could've
made the character look
a little more like a pineapple.
[Paul] It's a bit uneven inside.
It's an indication that it
has concertina-ed,
the weight of the fondant
and everything on top
has pushed the ones down at the bottom.
-Tastes amazing, though. [laughs]
-[Prue] It's delicious.
Oh, yeah, it's a happy cake.
[Prue] Citrusy yuzu…
It's really strong.
And the pineapple's there.
[Paul] Sponges are all light.
Even the concertina-ed one's
quite light as well.
Flavour of that whole thing is very good.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done, Laura.
[exhales]

*Mark*
They're cute. A little bit scruffy.
-[laughs]
-[Paul] But they are cute.
[Prue] I love it. It's witty.
It's charming. Just gotta taste good now.
Hope so.
[Prue] That's very neat,
accurate layering.
-It's a bit tight, that sponge.
-Mmm.
You've got the yuzu going through that?
-[Mark] Yeah.
-You get that…
And then that's it.
The cake's dry,
which you didn't expect it to be.
The oil from the avocado
should've kept that really silky smooth.
And it hasn't. It's a shame.
I don't know if the nine-inch cake
is a bit better at the bottom.
-I'm not sure.
-Let's have a look.
Hmm, no?
No.
Probably worse.
-Oh, no.
-[Prue laughing]
It's cruel to say it's inedible
but it's getting that way.
[Prue] The biscuit is actually delicious,
but as that's only less than 1%
of the whole lot,
I don't think it'll save it.

This is the first week that
I've been in the tent
and every single showstopper was a wow…
[Prue] To look at.
I thought the dogs looked amazing.
Based on Marc E's cake
and his invention with flavour,
he has to be in line for Star Baker.
Dave, as well, has put himself into
a decent position.
-Don't forget Lottie.
-[Noel] Lottie…
-[Prue] She had a terrific week.
-[Paul] Her sponge was incredible.
I've never, in the 11 series,
tasted a sponge quite like that.
-There's one that disappointed me.
-Really?
Probably disappointed
him more than it did me, is Mark L.
I thought the whole idea was
quirky and funny and very kawaii,
but the cake was awful.
Laura was in trouble
coming into this knowing she had to…
-Yeah.
-…do well to save herself.
She dropped an ace right in front of us.
That's the first time
I've seen her do something like that.
So overall, when you look at
the whole effort over the three challenges
and we've gotta look at
all the bakers that were in trouble,
and I would say it's Mark L.
I would say it was Laura.
And I will put Hermine down there as well.
-Interesting. Can I ask you a question?
-Yeah.
Is it your 100th episode today?
-Yes.
-[Noel] Wow.
I think you deserve
a glass of bubbly, don't you?
[laughs] Yeah, I think a bottle.
-A bath of bubbly.
-[Paul laughs] Yes.
Well, bakers, I think we can all agree
Japanese Week was a joy.
And the showstopper was fantastic.
I've got the great job of announcing
this week's Star Baker.
And that person is…
Lottie.
[all clapping and cheering]
[Lottie] Thank you.
-Thanks, guys.
-[Marc] Well done, Lottie.
Which means it's time to tell you
who will be leaving us this week,
and it's somebody who always has a smile,
somebody I've really bonded with,
someone that I know we all adore
and we're all really gonna miss.
And I'm afraid the baker
leaving us this week is…
Mark L.
That's all right.
[Dave] Mate… Come here, Mark.
-That's all right. I'm going home.
-[Paul] Sorry, mate.
When you know, you know, don't you?
And I just thought it was my time today.
I mean, they're happy tears
as well, because
you know, I've made it
to week six of Bake Off.
I'm going home having learned so much.
Made an amazing bunch of friends.
It's pushed me to bake things
I would never have baked before,
so I couldn't have asked for anything more
in my Bake Off experience.
It's been brilliant
from start to finish, it really has.
So, yeah. [laughs]
-[Prue] I'm so sorry.
-Thank you. It's okay.
Poor Mark. A disaster of a showstopper.
I actually thought
Laura would be going today,
but she did
a really wonderful showstopper.
You only have to do
one bad cake and you're out.
Or one good one and you survive.
[Matt] You thought you were gone.
[Laura] I thought I was going home.
I sat on that chair thinking,
"What do I pack first?"
"What route… Shall I take
the M25 or the M2 or the A2?"
"How do I get home?"
So, yeah, what a relief.
Final six is absolutely mad.
I honestly cannot believe
that I'm here saying that.
The game is on for sure.
None of us thought
we'd make it through this week.
Next week's a whole new ball game.
[laughs]
We've got a lot of work to do
in the practice tent, all of us do.
