*Crystelle*
-Hello, Crystelle.
-Hello.
-I wouldn't have made it this high.
-Yeah.
By stacking it, you're retaining the heat.
And then you're going
to get some movement.
And it doesn't say to me, "carrot cake,"
but it might when it's opened up.
There are a couple of dowels in there,
just to try and hold it together.
Mmm. I love the flavour.
[Paul] You've got cardamom,
pistachio and then orange.
-Together, it's a really nice flavour.
-You taste all of them.
Yes, and it's well balanced.
But it's not
the best-looking thing you've done.
[sighs]

*Chigs*
I particularly like your baby carrots.
[Paul] I think it looks very nice.
I love the pipe work.
-A bit solid.
-[Chigs] Yeah.
[Prue] You had a lot of carrot
and the carrot releases water
once it's in the batter.
I think the pineapple works well.
That bit of sweetness comes through it.
You expect a little bit of stodge
with a carrot cake.
-But this is a little bit rubbery.
-Okay.

*Giuseppe*
You were affected by heat.
It wasn't cold when you put it together
and therefore
you've got a bit of movement.
-But it's fairly level.
-[Prue] Yeah, I like the look of it.
It's three layers of sponge
with figs and walnut jam in between.
It has an absolutely delicious flavour,
but the texture is very soft.
[Paul] Because the cake was warm
when you did it,
that's what's causing you to think,
"Is it underbaked, stodgy?" It's not.
It's just you've got the cream cheese
and you've got the jam
and it's soaking into a warm cake.
-So that's…
-It's added moisture.
[Paul] Yes, it has.
But I think the flavours are delicious.
The idea of introducing figs was good.
And it still tastes like carrot cake.
Which is important.
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thank you.


Giuseppe. Would you like to bring out
your Showstopper?
Oh, God.
It's very precarious.
[Prue chuckles]
Well done.
I think it's simple and effective.
These are all very small.
I expected them to be a little bit bigger.
Okay.
[Prue] I don't mind
because it's a caterpillar.
The caterpillar is choux buns
with asparagus, peas filling
and mascarpone topping.
Mmm. Delicious.
You certainly get the asparagus. And pea.
Because it's been filled
with this creamy mixture,
they're quite soft now.
Which is a pity,
because it's all the same texture.
-Mmm.
-[Paul] Let's look at the sweet bread.
[Giuseppe] So the centrepiece is filled
with chocolate and hazelnut.
[Prue] Goodness!
That is quite complicated.
Hmm.
-It's very Italian in its flavour.
-[Prue] Isn't it?
[Paul] I like it, the bread is so crispy.
This is lovely.
-[Paul] This is the…
-[Giuseppe] Orange and figs.
-[Paul] Orange and fig.
-[Prue] They're very cute.
They're very soft, they're juicy,
and they have a lovely flavour to 'em.
-[Prue] They're very good.
-You can take one of these, Prue.
[Giuseppe] They're passion fruit,
mango, panna cotta
with brandy snaps.
[crunching]
The panna cotta is delicious.
[chuckles] I mean, it really is stunning.
[Prue] That is the most perfect texture
for a panna cotta.
Just set and it sort of cracks
as you touch it.
-I might finish this one.
-[Prue] Mmm.
-I'm taking it away with me.
-Yeah, you did well. Thanks very much.
[all laughing]
[Paul] I like the choux buns.
Love the heart cakes.
-And the panna cotta is bliss.
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.
-[Matt] Well done.
-[sighs]
-[sighs]
[sighs]
Chigs, would you like to bring
your final Showstopper up here?
Please may I have a hand
carrying it to the front, Matt?
-[Matt] Massive.
-[Chigs] Sorry.
To me.
-To you.
-To me.
-To you.
-[chuckling] To me.
To you.
-[Matt] Okay.
-[Paul] Thank you.
[inhales deeply]
I'm quite impressed
with the overall look of them.
I think you've got the Mad Hatter's
tea party very well.
I think the colour of the cat…
I love the cards.
-These are particularly interesting to me.
-[Prue] There's something mad.
Which is part of
the sort of surreal thing.
[Paul] These clocks look quite neat.
-Shall we start with the savoury first?
-Yeah, why not?
[Chigs] Chicken, sweet leek
and mushroom pies.
-That's delicious.
-[Prue] Mmm.
[Paul chuckling]
One of my favourite things.
Very nice pastry.
Has it got thyme in there?
-Thyme and tarragon.
-[Prue] That was delicious.
This is a brioche?
[Chigs] Yes.
Filled with a lemon and lime crème pat.
Delicious crème pat.
It's beautiful. It's nice and sweet,
but just the right level of sweetness.
It's nice-looking.
[Chigs] These are shortbread biscuits
with strawberry, elderflower
and black pepper jam.
-[Prue] I think it's beautiful.
-[Paul] It is.
[Prue] The punched-out hearts
are charming.
-Don't really like to spoil it.
-[Noel] Go on, Prue.
-[Prue] Mmm. Very good.
-[Paul] Jam's very good.
Jam is excellent.
[Paul] It's a nice, buttery biscuit.
I'm not getting the elderflower.
-I'm getting strawberry.
-And black pepper?
-No.
-[Chigs] Okay.
[Paul] The biscuit is delicious with it.
-Okay.
-[Prue] Right.
-[Paul] This is orange cake?
-[Chigs] Yeah.
It's got orange curd
and mascarpone cream in the middle.
I was looking forward
to the Cheshire cat's grin.
I know. I'd kind of run out of time.
[exhales heavily]
-[chuckling] That's a delicious sponge.
-It's really good.
The orange really works.
You're left with a beautiful
floral flavour in your mouth.
[Prue] You've not put too much buttercream
round the edge, so it's not too sweet.
That's a very nice cake.
-[Paul] Very good cake.
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Well done.
-You've done a good job.
-Well done, Chigs.
-[Chigs] Thanks.
-[Matt] Amazing.
-Thank you.
[breathing heavily]
[sighs in relief]
[exhales]
Crystelle, would you like to bring out
your Showstopper?
Please may I have a hand?
Three… two… one…
-Lift. Yeah.
-[Noel] You got it?
-[Crystelle] Yep.
-I've got puppet legs. Don't drop it.
It's okay.
I'm bending my knees and it's fine.
-Don't let go.
-Where you gonna go?
This way.
[chuckles] Don't go low on me.
Okay, we're gonna… Okay.
-Right. Er…
-[Prue] Brilliant.
[Noel whispers] There you go.
[Paul] It looks quite impressive.
It's colourful.
[Prue] I like the little sunflowers
with their faces.
What did you say
these biscuits were called?
They're called nankhatais. They've got
brown butter, cardamom and nuts.
[sighs]
-It's very fudge-like, isn't it?
-Yeah.
It's got a lovely balance of flavours
with the spices in there.
Delicious.
-[Paul] Let's move on to the talking--
-[Prue] Sunflowers.
Which are chai sponges
with cream cheese frosting.
I think that cake is really delicious.
It's very soft.
[Paul] The chai comes through beautifully.
Then the cooling from the cream cheese,
it blends nicely together.
[exhales]
[Paul] This is hot water crust pastry.
[Crystelle] Yeah. Filled with chickpea
and potato curry.
[exhales]
Very nice curry middle.
It's quite solid. But I really like that.
-Absolutely lovely.
-It's a Goan curry? It's delicious.
It's got a lovely kick to it as well.
That's three out of four.
[all chuckle]
-[Paul] Right. Focaccia.
-[Prue] Yeah.
[Crystelle] Which is a za'atar,
garlic and honey focaccia.
[exhales]
Er…
This is not recognizable as focaccia.
-[Crystelle] Oh, no!
-That's raw dough.
[exhales]
-What have you done? That is raw.
-[Crystelle] I don't know.
-Has it been in the oven?
-Yeah.
I don't know what happened.
-That's bizarre.
-[Paul] There's no rise at all.
That's inedible, that one.
-[Prue] That's a pity.
-[Paul] Never seen anything like it.
I'm really sorry. I don't know
what happened. That's bizarre.
But over all, I think your flavours
of what we did try was very good.
Thank you.
-[Prue] Thank you.
-Thank you.


[Matt] Everyone in our bubble
who has been locked down
and worked so hard to make
the Baking Show happen
has been invited to
the greatest Mad Hatter's tea party
of 2021.
And to witness
who will be crowned champion.
Do you think Crystelle
could still win this?
[Paul] It's got complicated
because she's dropped,
because of the focaccia being raw.
-I could see her heart sink then.
-I know. Poor girl.
[Paul] So Chigs has come from the outside.
You were very impressed with Chigs.
You were pretty impressed with Giuseppe
but when it came to this,
-you couldn't stop eating it.
-That was very good.
We don't want to rush
into picking someone,
so we'll sit down,
have another cup of tea,
maybe a couple of glasses of wine.
See you tomorrow, chaps.
-[chuckling] See you tomorrow.
-We might not be back, is that okay?
That's fine, we'll do it ourselves.
[all cheering]
Well, before we do anything else,
I would like to thank,
on behalf of the show,
everybody who looked after us
here at the hotel.
The cleaners, the caterers
and all of the staff.
Thank you so much.
[all cheering and applauding]
And, now, I would like to invite
our three finalists
to come and join us.
[all cheering]
Giuseppe. Come on.
You guys are amazing.
Bakers, thank you so much
for bringing your warmth
and good humour and, of course,
your brilliant bakes into the tent.
And now, I'm going to hand over
to my colleague, Mr. Noel Fielding,
who has something to tell you.
The winner
of The Great British Baking show is…
Giuseppe.
[all cheering]
[Crystelle yelling] Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
[Noel chuckling]
-[Noel chuckling] Congratulations!
-[Matt] Congratulations, man.
[cheering continues]
[Paul] Well done, Giuseppe.
Thank you. Grazie.
[both laugh]
-[Prue] Well done!
-[voice breaking] Grazie.
[cheers and applause continue]
There are no words.
[chuckling] I'm speechless.
For once.
[Paul] You're the first Italian
to ever win it.
[all laughing]
From the first time
I walked into the tent,
on the first Signature
and I saw his mini rolls, I went,
"That looks like our winner."
You could see the heart and soul
going into his baking.
He's done an incredible job.
He's such a classic, beautiful baker.
He represents a long tradition
of classical Italian baking.
And done it brilliantly
the whole way through.
So I'm going home
to make lots more Italian cakes,
'cause they really are good.
[Chigs grunts] Come on.
Well done, my friend. You deserve it.
[Chigs] I am over the moon
that Giuseppe's won
'cause I know how hard he has worked
throughout this whole competition.
It's a euphoric moment.
It's time to move on
to the next challenge in my life.
Bake Off final. Tick. [chuckles]
Thanks. Sorry about the focaccia.
I am so happy for Giuseppe.
He's an incredible… I'm getting emotional.
He's an incredible guy.
So genuine, an insane baker
and he really deserves that win.
His family are gonna be so proud of him.
-[Noel] Let that sink in.
-[Giuseppe] I'm in shock. I'm in shock.
All I can think of is the reaction
I'm gonna get from my mum and dad.
The fact that everything
I've done to deserve this
comes from his heritage.
I think it's going to be the best
thank-you note I could possibly send him.
He's going through
a very hard time, health-wise, so…
Er, I think that this is
going to be a boost.
-[Matt] Go take a bow.
-[woman] Go on!
[all cheering]
[Giuseppe] I don't say often and lightly
that I'm proud of what I do…
But, in this case,
I can't possibly not say that.
I'm really, really proud that I did this.
[speaking Italian] It's unbelievable,
it's unbelievable.
[all cheering]
[emotional music playing]
