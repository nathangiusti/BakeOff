*Hermine*
They look really interesting
-and very elegant.
-[Paul] Mmm.
-And quite modern.
-[Paul] I love the pipe work on them.
There's a little irregularity
with the colour on these.
Let's have a look.
I love the little tempered chocolate disk
on the top.
I quite like the flavour.
Alcohol's just enough to give it a kick.
The Chantilly and crème pat
work beautifully, nice and creamy
and the texture's all good.
The savarin itself,
it's slightly under-proofed.
The air holes inside are very tight,
they should be a little more open.
-[Prue] I find it a little tough…
-[Paul] Mmm.
…and too bread-like. Flavour's lovely.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

*Laura*
At first glance,
I think they're really pretty.
I love the combination of colours.
They're golden brown.
They really do look scrumptious.
They're a little bit messy on the icing.
Likewise with the actual bake.
They all look different sizes.
That one looks bigger than this one.
Let's have a look.
-[Prue] So what's in the little pipette?
-[Laura] Rum syrup.
-[Prue] Squeeze and it'll get more?
-[Laura] Yeah.
That's a lovely, light sponge.
That's beautiful.
[Paul] Got some spice in there?
-[Laura] I put star anise and cinnamon.
-Cinnamon? Mmm.
You slightly overdid it
with some of the spices.
-Okay.
-[Paul] It's little things.
You're like a rough diamond.
Need polishing up a little bit.
-[Prue] This is a very good rum baba.
-Thank you.
Nobody would send it back in a restaurant.
I probably would. Just to meet the chef.

*Dave*
They look unusual.
They're different. Bold, strong colour.
Ripped it there
getting it out of the mould.
-Yeah.
-I think they look really sensational
and fun.
Well, the texture of the cake is so light.
It's almost impossible
to get it onto the fork.
-I think it's lovely.
-[Prue] Mmm. So do I.
[Paul] I don't get
the curd sitting at the bottom.
-I know it's a design thing…
-Yeah.
…but I would've put that inside
and topped it with chocolate.
But, you know, the thing that surprises me
is I thought
you had too many flavours in this.
-It's not. It really works.
-Really, thank you.
-Cheers.

*Peter*
[Paul] I think they look very neat
and very uniform.
It looks like they're quite soaked,
which is good.
-[Prue] That looks light.
-[Paul] Lovely.
[Prue] Look at that.
I didn't think I was going to like
a savarin without any booze in it.
[chuckles]
-But it's delicious.
-[Peter] Fantastic.
-[Prue] Mouth-watering.
-Yeah.
You got such a nice texture to that.
Very open inside,
which is classic savarin.
All I can say, Peter…
-Oh, wow.
-Welcome back to the tent.
Thank you so much.

*Dave*
Dave, would you like to bring up
your showstopper?
-I think they look great.
-Cheers, thank you.
[Paul] Neat, tidy, uniform.
The chocolate is holding
which is amazing considering the heat.
That was a brave choice.
I like that you made the base, too.
So it looks quite neat.
[Matt] Mmm.
[Prue] Look at that caramel in the middle.
Personally, I think they're a triumph.
The caramel is delicious.
It's just the right melting point,
so it oozes, but it still holds.
The mousse is perfectly set.
[Prue] And the amount of mousse
and filling is quite a lot,
so when you get a mouthful,
it's all fudgy.
[Paul] Everything together…
-Very good.
-Thank you.
[Paul] You've improved
a lot actually, David.
Yeah, I think I have, as well.
I feel that I've improved myself.
-Well done.
-Cheers. Thank you.

*Laura*
The heat's taken its toll.
It's really difficult
because it's melting,
it looks a little bit messy.
-[Paul] This is Patisserie Week.
-I know.
-So it's gotta look good.
-[Laura] I'm so disappointed in the look.
[Prue] Mmm.
Absolutely delicious.
I love the flavours going through there.
[Prue] The textures are terrific.
The whole cherries, that was brave,
but it's really delicious.
[Paul] Not the best you've ever made,
but the flavours are really good.
Worth all the calories.
-Yay! [chuckles]
-[Paul] Thank you.
Well done, Laura.
-Thanks. You, too.

*Peter*
That is so clever, Peter.
And so complicated.
[Paul] The overall look is effective
'cause you've got a nice shine
on all of them.
And it's set beautifully.
Sponge and the mousse are gorgeous.
-[Prue] Mmm.
-[Paul] Really nice.
I just wanna see what one
of the other one's like.
Let's go for the chocolate one.
[Peter] It has pistachio mousse
and a raspberry sponge.
Works beautifully.
Can I ask that you try the final one?
It's my favourite.
So that's pistachio cake,
chocolate mousse, raspberry glaze.
Like a sort of friand cake.
-Oh, that one quite disappoints me.
-Oh, no.
-Only joking.
-[all laughing]
-[Prue] I love them.
-[Paul] Very clever. Well executed.

*Hermine*
Erm, well, it doesn't look great, does it?
No. Not my finest, I'm afraid.
[Prue] The mousse hasn't quite set here.
[Paul] The bottom is collapsing
with the weight as it's melting.
But before it melts too much,
let's have a quick look.
That, for me, tastes more like raspberry
than it does cherry.
It's the outside with the raspberry on it,
I love the flavour.
These do feel like panna cotta.
It's really odd.
It's actually quite stodgy and bouncy.
It's got too much gelatin in it.
It's like a rubber ball.
-It's a shame.
-[Prue] To be honest,
-I'm really disappointed…
-I am, too.
…because you are so good at patisserie
and this is, by your standards,
it's a failure.

I think it goes without saying
I'm really disappointed in myself.
I haven't had any disastrous bake.
This is my first one. It's a shame
that it happened in week nine.
If I do make it to the final,
it would mean a lot.
But it's really 50/50.
[Peter] I'm happy. Yeah.
It's been a really good week.
Got my first handshake,
first in the technical.
I think I've got a really good
shot for Star Baker.
[Dave] That was phenomenal.
I am so proud
that I even managed to pull that off.
Paul said it was a triumph.
And that's gonna stick with me forever.
[Laura] That went
a lot better than expected.
Prue said it was worth the calories.
That's the golden comment
you want from Prue,
so it's gonna be close.
I'm certain it's between
me and Hermine going home.
Hopefully, it'll be enough.
[Matt] Let's start
with who's had a good week.
I think the lads had a good week.
David and Peter have both done very well.
He struggled from the off.
To come up with that in the semifinal?
[Prue] Absolutely delicious,
and it's such a sophisticated thing to do.
The other thing
that was really good was Peter's.
[Paul] I liked the fact that he had
different mousses going in.
Each one, the flavours were amazing.
I would like to give Star Baker
to both those boys.
But what I found so disappointing
is Hermine.
This is Patisserie Week.
It should've been her finest hour, really.
[Paul] This is basically a rubber ball.
But in her defence,
Hermine made two things.
Laura did one cake.
Doesn't look brilliant,
but when you bit into that,
that was absolutely delicious.
But how many times have we said
Laura's got to save herself
in the showstopper? Five times?
Hermine did have a better technical.
This is a tricky one.
This could go either way.
-[Matt] Really?
-Yeah.
And this is the worst time
to go out, isn't it?
-It's heartbreaking. You're just there.
-It's brutal.
But that's the position we're in.
Well, it's time for me to tell you
who has been Star Baker this week.
There are a couple of candidates,
but this week's Star Baker is…
Peter.
Well done, Peter.
That leaves me
with the horrible job of announcing
the baker who will be leaving us.
It's especially hard
because the person who's leaving us
is not gonna get to the final,
and you've all been so fantastic
to get this far.
But sadly, there can only be three.
So the person who is leaving us…
is Hermine.
Aw.
-[Hermine] It's been a pleasure.
-[Dave] It has.
I'm disappointed 'cause, er,
I didn't want to leave.
-[Laura] Sorry.
-It's fine.
I'm so sorry.
I believe everything has a reason,
and it was the right time for me.
You are so good
and that was just a bad day, wasn't it?
When I go home and I have time to reflect,
there will be, you know,
a lot of happy memories,
a lot of proud moments.
You've been an inspiration,
you really have.
[Hermine] Thank you.
I take a lot of good things
away from this.
Well done for getting Star Baker.
I've hit Bake Off jackpot this week.
[Prue] You are such a clever lad.
Thank you very much, Prue.
I think it'll take a while to sink in.
It feels a bit surreal.
This whole thing is surreal.
I mean, we're locked down
in a country estate
with Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood
eating your bakes
and Matt Lucas coming round
to make you laugh with Noel.
[laughs] It's bonkers.
-[Matt] Congratulations.
-Thanks.
[Matt] You made the final.
Like, genuinely
I can't process it all right now.
[laughing] It's mad.
Er, like I'm in the final
of The Great British Bake Off.
Like, the actual final.
Like, yeah. It's, erm… [speaks gibberish]
[laughing]
Maybe it's sinking in a little bit now.
You are flying. Think of that. The final.
[Dave] I know. Yeah.
Hasn't sunk in yet.
I can't express how happy I am.
[exhales]
It's just unreal. Just can't believe it.
