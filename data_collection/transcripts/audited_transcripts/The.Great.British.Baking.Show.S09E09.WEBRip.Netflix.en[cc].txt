*Chigs*
-Hi.
-[Prue] It looks good, Chigs.
-[Chigs] Thank you.
I like them a lot. You've managed
to create nice, sharp lines.
-Very Parisian.
-[Prue] Making my mouth water.
Erm, I like the sponge in there.
The sponge is good.
I think you've got just enough chocolate
there to marry it with the raspberry.
-Mmm.
-[Chigs] Are you serious?
-[Paul] Absolutely.
-[bakers clapping]
[Chigs] Thank you.
[Prue] I was a bit nervous
because that chocolate is quite strong.
Then I took it with the raspberry,
and it's perfect.
-[Paul] Yeah.
-So, that was all right, then.
-Well done.
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you, Chigs.
-Thank you, guys.

*Jurgen*
Very nice, Jürgen.
The layers look stark, sharp.
The daggers make it,
'cause it does look very different
from a traditional opera cake.
[Prue] Thank you.
I think that's sensational.
-Thank you.
-The textures are absolutely perfect.
I like it, but I don't love it.
The flavour I do get is coffee.
And a bit of chocolate.
I cannot taste anything else.
Beetroot will bring colour and sweetness,
but it won't bring flavour.
Textures are spot-on, though,
I'll give you that.
Pity I'm not the one
who hands out handshakes.
-Thank you.

*Crystelle*
[Prue] They're very unusual.
Really striking.
-[Noel] Exotic caterpillar colours.
-That's exactly what I was going for.
-[chuckles]
-[Noel] I hope so.
It's quite an unusual texture
because the dacquoise is really chewy.
[Paul] Yuzu is such a beautiful flavour.
But then you're left with the sesame
and that gorgeous texture of the creams
and the sponges going through there.
Oh, my God. [exclaims]
-Well done.
-[bakers clapping]
[Prue] Crystelle, that's absolutely
deserved because it's very striking.
It's absolutely delicious.
It's a little bit of genius.
[Paul] I've never had
anything like that before.
-Well done.
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.
-Well done.

*Giuseppe*
It's really very elegant,
and looks very stylish.
Because the Joconde is soaked,
it's so soft.
-It's just delicious.
-It is.
[Prue laughing]
-How annoying is that?
-[contestants applaud]
The masala wine in there,
and the stewed sultanas
gives that little bit of body to it.
Sorry, I don't understand
anything you're saying.
-I'm just trying to fight back…
-[all laughing]

*Jurgen*
Jürgen, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?
Love the gate. It's very authentic.
The colour of the entremets
don't really draw you in.
It's a bit bland.
[Prue] This shape is perfect
for those little Japanese boats,
but if you'd had time, you could have
piped some detail on them
or something to have
made them stand out a bit more.
Hmm.
That's very interesting.
Different layers of taste,
one after another.
[Paul] Your raspberry jelly's
got a nice kick to it.
And that matcha
is hidden by the raspberry.
There's still a hint,
but the raspberry comes through.
You didn't want it the other way,
it would've been dry on the palate.
-Thank you.
-Well done.
Well done, Jürgen.
Well done, Jürgen.
[Jürgen] Thank you.

*Giuseppe*
Giuseppe, you said
you hadn't even practised this.
It's just amazing. It's leaning
more than the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
I think I made the leaning tower
wonkier than it is.
These look fairly straightforward
on the outside.
All the work, of course,
with an entremet, is on the inside.
-Yeah.
-[Paul] Oh, lovely.
-[Noel] Beautiful green.
-[Matt] Hmm.
[Prue] The bavarois is very delicious,
but the pine nut's
not coming through very well.
Oh, okay.
Without that cherry,
you really would be hunting for flavours.
Having said that,
all your textures are spot-on.
Thank you.
[Matt] Well done.
[Chigs] Well done, Giuseppe.

*Chigs*
-It's very impressive.
-Thank you.
I'm knocked back by the purple colour.
They look more like a plums.
I should've put
more red colouring in the glaze.
-Pink ladies, that's what they are.
-Yeah, right.
I love that they're sitting on a biscuit.
And the biscuit looks well baked as well.
Hmm.
-It's exceptional.
-[chuckles nervously]
Your apple
has got a little tartness to it.
You can taste the caramel
in the bavarois as well.
And you have that slight
bitterness from the chocolate.
So you've got all the flavours
correctly balanced
to create an apple scene with the tree.
You've really been
on a journey, haven't you?
You started baking last year.
Look what you've done.
That is very, very, very good.
-[Chigs] Thank you, Paul.
-[Prue] Thanks, Chigs.
-Well done.
-Thank you very much.

*Crystelle*
-That's stunning.
-[Prue] Love the colours.
If it was in the middle
of a wedding table,
all eyes would be upon it.
[Paul] What I'm interested in
is those entremets,
they look like works of arts.
[Prue] Mmm.
That, Crystelle, is flawless.
-[Paul] I don't know what I can say.
-It's just beautiful.
The passion fruit is really strong.
The mango much silkier. It is lovely.
-Absolutely lovely.
-Thank you. Sorry.
[Prue laughing]
-Thank you, Crystelle.
-Thank you so much.


[Matt] Wow. There are four really
impressive bakers in this tent.
I do not envy you the task
of having to separate them.
What's almost unique,
we're picking the worst of the best.
It really is difficult
because all of them tasted fantastic.
Crystelle.
Look at the layers in that.
The coconut biscuit.
-[Paul] The glaze is stunning.
-[Prue] Yes.
And Chigs, look
at the amount of skill in that.
There's a biscuit, a crumble.
There's a wonderful chocolate case,
which is not easy to do.
[Paul] Jürgen was clever
with the matcha and the raspberry.
-A bit boring to look at.
-And then you come down to Giuseppe.
My only complaint with this.
-I love the beautiful colour.
-So neat.
[Prue] And the cherry is fantastic.
My only complaint?
I couldn't taste the pine nut.
[Matt] So we're
in a very unusual position, where--
You could argue for any one of these.
This is the worst time to go home as well,
so it's horrible.
Yes, it is. It's really hard.
I don't know
how you're gonna make this decision.
[Noel] Ah, bakers,
this is such a precarious point
in the competition.
Obviously,
everyone wants to get to the final
and it's so close at this point,
it's just crazy.
I've got the amazing job
of announcing Star Baker.
The person who is Star Baker is…
Crystelle.
[Crystelle gasps]
-Oh, my God.
-[Chigs] Why are you surprised?
Why are you so surprised?
-Oh, my God.
-[Chigs] You just smashed it.
[Matt] Okay.
I'm afraid to say
that the person who will not
be making it into the final,
and who will be going home is…
Jürgen.
No.
[Crystelle] What?
[Giuseppe] What?
[Paul] Sorry, mate.
[Jürgen] I feel kind of okay,
I… I kind of saw it coming.
[laughs]
I think the others
are more shocked than I am.
[Crystelle] Oh, my gosh.
Jürgen, you've been
an inspiration, really.
-Like one of the most…
-Oh, Jürgen.
…incredible bakers ever.
You were amazing.
[voice breaking] It's been incredible.
It's been an absolute pleasure
to have you with us here.
Really enjoyed being here.
I made friends for life.
And I will be with them…
[chuckles] in… In spirit.
-See you in the final.
-[Crystelle] Thank you so much, Paul.
Erm…
shell-shocked is an understatement.
Hi, Star Baker.
It's just, I don't think
it's really hit me, really. It's mad.
Star Baker in Patisserie Week.
I'm in the final.
[voice breaking] Just a lot of things
that don't make sense.
[Noel, whispering]
You're in the final. [laugh]
I ain't got a clue what I'm doing here.
How has that happened?
I'm so shocked. I don't know what to say.
I am now cacking it. [laughs nervously]
I am scared sockless.
But I'm really, really--
Happy's not the right word,
I'm over the moon.
I just want to make the best out of it
and have a jolly good time next week.
Hi, is everyone there?
-[woman] Yeah.
-Erm, not good news.
You're not gonna see me for
another week because I got Star Baker!
-[laughs]
-[woman screaming]
[screaming continues]
[sniffling] I know, guys,
I'm in the final. [laughs]
