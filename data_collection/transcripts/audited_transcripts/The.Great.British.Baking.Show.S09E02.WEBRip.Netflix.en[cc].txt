*Freya*
-[Prue] Hello, Freya.
-Hi.
I think they look absolutely scrumptious.
Oh, thank you.
[Paul] They do look quite dark.
Have you got coffee in the snaps?
Yeah, little bit of coffee liqueur.
-[Paul] Nice lace on it though.
-[Prue] A good snap on top.
Hmm, nice flavour.
Quite strong coffee,
maybe even a tiny bit too strong.
How many espressos did you put in there?
-Eight tablespoons.
-Sorry?
-Eight tablespoons?
-I like a lot of coffee.
You needed waking up.
You were steaming drunk last night.
It's not that bad. I love it.
For me, it's just
a little bit too much coffee,
but overall, I think
you've done a decent job.
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

*Amanda*
You made your brandy snaps
with the cold method?
[Amanda] I did.
[Paul] They're very thin
so therefore they're very delicate.
The whole shape of it is falling apart.
But the flavour is absolutely delicious.
Thank you.
[Paul] Stem ginger with the sesame seed…
-Mmm.
-[Prue] It's really lovely.
I would like to just squinch that up,
'cause it doesn't look very good,
and have it for pudding.
-You would, wouldn't you?
-Oh, I would.
Thank you.

*Jairzeno*
[Paul] They're a little bit messy.
The laid-back thing, I'm beginning
to see this in some of your work.
[Jairzeno] There was a bit of rushing
in the last 15 minutes, so…
-[Paul] We've had that before, haven't we?
-We have.
I didn't think the chocolate would go
with those fruit flavours, but it does.
I just think that
the flavours are too strong.
-Oh.
-I mean, I couldn't eat a whole one.
The idea was sound, but not well-executed.
Hmm.

*Rochica*
-[Paul] Massive variety in size.
-I did weigh them out so I'm not sure.
[Prue] Some of them
are longer than the others.
[Paul] You've got the Irish cream, coffee,
chocolate and hazelnut.
-I think it's delicious.
-[Prue] And some booze.
Yeah, I added an extra tablespoon.
Thought you might like that.
You're right. You've got me in one.
Well done, Rochica.

*George*
-[Prue] Hello, George.
-Hello.
Bit irregular in size. Every one of them.
[crunching]
Mmm.
-That's mastika.
-[Paul] Orange blossom and mastika.
The flavours together work very well.
My issue is they just look a mess.
I'm a perfectionist,
and I really dislike serving that up.
-Well…
-Yeah.
You should take comfort in the fact
that they are original and sensational.
-[Paul] Thanks, George.
-Yeah, thank you.

*Crystelle*
-[Prue] Hello, Crystelle.
-Hello.
I saw you saying a little prayer then.
Yeah, I was absolutely panicking. [laughs]
-Lovely snap.
-The flavour combination's beautiful.
That lovely crunch
from the crumble and the apples
with that little hint of cinnamon.
-You've done well with the flavours.
-[Prue] And the textures.
Thank you so much. Thanks.

*Lizzie*
[Paul] What's that on the top?
That's the fast food
clagginess that you get.
The congealed stuff.
Oh, delicious.
Well, I don't know
how to make it sound nice.
-Well, don't say "congealed."
-They're the words that come to me head.
-[Paul] There's very little lace in there.
-Yeah.
But it is delicious. That does
taste of apple. It tastes of brandy.
-[Paul] The crème diplomat's nice.
-Altogether it's a lovely mouthful.
-[Paul] Thank you very much.
-Ta.

*Giuseppe*
[Prue] That's really pretty.
I think they look very elegant,
pretty uniform in colour,
nice lace as well in the brandy snap.
Let's see what it tastes like.
The brandy snap is delicious,
crisp, nicely flavoured.
[Paul] Chocolate doesn't
come through massively strong.
So what's happened is
it's sort of lost its way.
You do get this blast of hazelnut,
but otherwise, you've done very well.
-Cheers, guys.
-[Prue] Well done.

*Chigs*
[Prue] They're nice and lacy.
[Paul] The chocolate comes through,
the brandy snap's got a lovely snap.
Just the right amount of sweetness
in there as well.
The cream's okay, but you've lost
a little bit of the coffee flavour.
-It's just a little bit weak.
-Fair enough.
-Very good.
-Thank you very much.

*Maggie*
[Prue] They're very small
and they could have had
a more colour on them.
I'm really quite disappointed.
[Prue] Because you've done a traditional…
-[Maggie] Yes.
-…filled brandy snap.
-The cream has sogged up the brandy snap.
-Yes.
Which weren't quite baked enough anyway
so they're really chewy.
-Right.
-But they are delicious.
[Paul] I love the tanginess
from the blackcurrant,
but, um, the practicalities really
haven't worked out very well.
No indeed,
and that's what's disappointing.
-Onwards and upwards.
-[laughs]
Thank you very much.

*Jurgen*
[Paul] Overall, they look pretty good.
[Prue] Nice and even.
They are lovely and thin.
-[crunches]
-[Matt] I hear a crunch.
-[Prue] Mmm-hmm.
-I can.
The blend of the spices,
the cardamom and the cinnamon
work beautifully well.
It's so easy to get it wrong
by putting too much in,
it overwhelms either the brandy snap
or the cream.
But it just doesn't. I think
texture-wise, you've done well as well.
The crème pat's perfect.
It's not too stodgy.
-I think you've done well on that. Yeah.
-[Prue] Mmm.
[Paul] Thank you, Jürgen.

*George*
George, would you like to fly on down?
-[motor whirring]
-[all cheering]
That is really wonderful.
That is definitely interactive.
-That's amazing.
-Even sounds like a plane.
It's a pretty basic plane,
but it does go round.
The design on this is great.
[Noel groans]
-That can be repaired.
-[laughs]
Nice wing.
It's not too hard. But it's very crisp.
-Shall we taste both?
-[Paul] They work well as a sort of cloud.
[Prue] What are the flavours in there?
-Pistachios, brandy.
-What's not to like?
-Well done, George. Thank you.
-Thanks.
That's so good. So good.

*Rochica*
[Paul] Ingenious.
You have a lot of moving parts.
You can play with it. Look.
-[exclaims]
-Oh, no. [laughs]
You've broken it on the first go.
[Prue] I did. But we can do it like that.
[Paul] Yes.
It's so delicate, it's so thin.
-The texture's spot-on.
-[Prue] Very good.
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you, Rochica.

*Giuseppe*
Properly engineered.
The way that the counters sit in
the little recess here. It looks amazing.
It's a very classic ginger biscuit.
I quite like that.
It's the cardamom
and the cloves coming through.
-[Prue] Well done, Giuseppe.
-Thank you.

*Chigs*
-[Paul] Oh, nearly!
That's very clever.
-[Prue] Now it just has to taste wonderful
-I know.
[Prue] And it's a little bit cakey.
But I like that, especially if it's thick,
you don't want it to be too hard.
[Paul] It's perfect.
-But you're missing a row of red balls.
-[Chigs] I know.
-Trust you to count them.

*Lizzie*
There's a show, "Paint Along with Prue."
[Paul] Getting out of jail free
by adding that palette
and saying "paint it yourself"
is interesting.
The ginger and the chocolate together,
it is probably too strong.
-Okay.
-[Prue] You know what?
If you have it with a bit of icing,
it tones it down and it's delicious.
-Well done.
-Ta.
[Matt] Well done.
With that painting skills, you could get
a job in our factory if this goes wrong.
Done.

*Jurgen*
[Prue] Look at that.
[Prue chuckles]
You've created quite a high structure,
but having said that, it is so thin.
[Prue] Well I agree, it's sehr gut.
-It really is.
-Danke schön.
It looks beautiful.
[Paul grunts]
It's not overly sweet at all.
But it's got
a lovely flavour in the mouth.
-[Prue] Very nice.
-[Paul] You've done a great job.
Again. Konditor meister.
-Thank you.
-[Matt] Well done.
Oh, God. Gonna be sick. I can't do this.

*Crystelle*
[Prue] I'll taste the brush.
Lovely. Lemon and poppy.
Yeah.
-[Prue] Beautiful.
-I think the design's very clever.
And I think you've got
your flavours spot on too.
-[sighs in relief]
-[Prue] Well done.

*Freya*
I think that's beautiful.
And I love the painting.
Do you think it could be a bit softer?
I think it's okay, considering
what it's doing. It's not overly hard.
Structurally she's pretty sound as well.
Thank you so much.

*Amanda*
[Prue sighs]
The saddle is beautiful,
the tail, the head.
Must have been heartbreaking
to see the thing collapse.
It was a little bit, yeah.
[Prue] Let's see what it tastes like.
It's a sugar biscuit
and that's, erm, honey buttercream.
-It's brave not to do gingerbread.
-Thank you.
I would never in a million years
have chosen that biscuit to build this.
-It's so delicate.
-[Prue] Mmm.
But you managed to--
I've made it three times before
and it stayed up.
[Paul] Just a shame
it looks the way it does.
It would've been right up there.
Would admit that's some of the best
biscuit things that we'd have ever had.
Thank you.

*Maggie*
[Paul] For me, it's a bit basic.
I think, as a decoration,
it needs to be a lot more elaborate.
[Prue] But I think we need
to taste the gingerbread.
[Paul] I would've made that a little bit
thinner to allow a nice snap.
-Yes.
-It's a little bit thick and heavy.
I think if you were looking
at a traditional school report,
it'd say, "Needs to try harder."
-[Matt] Well done.
-[Noel] Well done, Maggie.

*Jairzeno*
Looks a bit rough and ready.
The rough-and-ready look
of the painting was deliberate.
And there were two sails.
There was a tall sail at the back,
but the mast broke.
-'Cause of the water, the waves.
-[Matt laughing]
It's the way the cargo was loaded,
that was the problem.
-And that too, yeah.
-[Prue chuckling]
Don't give me that waffle.
Let's have a go at the biscuit.
Mmm, the cardamom
comes through well in that.
It's a lovely blend.
[Prue] It tastes delicious,
but it's a bit rough and ready.
-[Paul] Thank you.
-[Matt] Well done.

[Matt] It's decision time
for Prue and Paul.
Who will be named Star Baker
and whose time in the tent
will come to an end?
Week two, that was a pretty high
standard of Showstopper, wasn't it?
-That was great.
-[Prue] It really was.
I felt so sorry for Amanda.
If that rocking horse had held together,
it would've been right up there
because it tasted beautiful.
It was so delicate.
The one I'm most
worried about is Jairzeno.
You were looking at that going,
"It's kind of a ship."
Or a barge. He had a very leaky stern.
All his bakes have been rough and ready.
I think Jairzeno is in
a little bit of trouble, I agree.
And I would even put Maggie down there.
She struggled in the signature
and I wasn't convinced that that beach hut
was strong enough.
But I think, for me,
in line for Star Baker, Jürgen.
-[Prue] Yes, certainly.
-[Paul] Giuseppe's up there as well.
-[Prue] What about Chigs?
-I think Chigs has to be up there
because that snooker table is fantastic.
One of the names you didn't mention there
who did really well, I think, was George.
[Paul] George, I think,
sort of jumped up a bit.
[Prue] I love George
because I think he has real imagination,
and his concepts are always great.
-Yeah, they're really good.
-They're just sort of…
-[Noel] He's not very neat.
-…tatty at the edges.
I just had this thought…
I mean, George grew up in Cyprus.
You were in Cyprus for a while.
You're probably, what, about 25 years
older than George?
You like the ladies. Do you feel
a sort of paternal sense towards him?
-Matt, this is going nowhere.
-Yeah. It's finished, don't worry.
Well, bakers, it falls to me to announce
who is the smartest cookie.
Do you see what I did there?
That was really good, wasn't it?
This week's Star Baker is…
Jürgen.
[all applauding]
That means I've got the horrible job
of announcing who's going home.
This only gets harder
as we get to know you all,
but the person who's leaving us
this week is…
Jairzeno.
Sorry, bro.
-You don't deserve to go, oh, God.
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Loved the idea, mate.
-Thank you.
I was half-expecting that result
because if you look at the Showstopper,
compared to everybody else's,
mine was quite basic.
-Oh, I'm so sad.
-[chuckles]
[sighs] I'm really relieved,
but I am absolutely gutted
that Jairzeno's gone.
We sit and talk all the time.
He's so lovely. He's so laid-back.
And his flavours are amazing.
I don't understand, well…
Someone has to go.
[Maggie] Amazing, I mean…
But I think, this afternoon,
I learned the real meaning
of the little expression,
"The skin of your teeth."
[Prue] Well done, Giuseppe.
You really did good.
Thank you very much.
I've had a very, very good couple of days.
I'm very happy with how it went.
Jürgen deserved it entirely.
It's very stiff competition.
[Rochica] I'm so proud of you.
[line ringing]
I've got no plans
for stopping The Baking Terminator.
[Giuseppe laughs]
-Hello?
-Hi, Benjamin. This is Jürgen.
I'm Star Baker again.
-[Benjamin laughs] No way.
-Yes.
-[woman] Jürgen.
-[Jürgen] Yes.
-[woman] Is it true?
-It is true.
-[woman] My goodness.
-[chuckles]
-[woman laughs]
-Yeah, crazy, isn't it?
[closing theme playing]
