*Peter*
-Hello, Peter.
-Hello.
They look incredibly good.
Let's hope they taste good.
I do like the look of them.
They're very professional.
I love the way you've got
the raspberries standing in the halves.
[Prue] That's a lovely
flaky pastry, isn't it?
[Paul] You can see all
the layers. It looks very good.
Mmm. The oats are really delicious on top.
They're crunchy, slightly caramelised.
The custard is good. Beautiful flavour
with the whisky and raspberry.
It's probably a little bit thick.
-Okay.
-[Paul] Only a little.
But the saving grace is the raspberry.
Because the raspberries carry more liquid,
so the balance is there.
You thought it through
and ticked every single box.
It's a really lovely custard slice.
-[Paul] Hmm.
-Thank you very much.

*Dave*
I intended for the wobbly lines.
-I like them.
-It's all about wobbly these days.
-Absolutely.
-Wobble, wobble.
[Dave] This should hopefully
have a wobble.
[Prue] That stood up to that.
That is delicious.
The pastry's beautiful and flaky.
A gorgeous coffee flavour going through.
It's a little stodgy, the custard.
-Okay, yeah.
-[Prue] It's still pretty delicious.
I mean, it's not stodgy, stodgy.
And I love the coffee, and it's
a really strong espresso sort of flavour.
[Paul] Well done.
-[Dave] Cheers. Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done.

*Laura*
I'm just so embarrassed to serve you that.
I'm so sorry.
It's so sad.
How much gelatin did you have in?
-Ten leaves of gelatin in the custard.
-Ten leaves?
-It should have set like concrete.
-[Laura] Yeah.
Part of the problem,
it could be the flavours
could have broken it down.
-Okay.
-Yuzu, you've got in there?
-Yeah.
-Put too much flavour
in a custard, it can't set.
[Prue] The flavours
actually sound wonderful.
That's a bit hard.
You've lost a lot of your butter
in your pastry.
So you've lost the colour, as well.
-Mmm.
-[Paul] So it's very hard.
-Mmm.
-[Paul] It's like a cracker
rather than rough puff.
[Prue] Hmm.
The yuzu is very sharp. It is very strong.
And I love the flavours.
But that puff pastry is not good.
Laura, you've had a bad morning,
but it tastes delicious.
-Thank you.

*Laura*
Individually, if we had a plate
with the key lime pie on
and a plate with the bun on
and a plate with the cake on,
I'd have gone, "That's nice."
I think individually,
they'd probably look better.
-[Paul] Let's look at the base.
-[Laura] It's a carrot and walnut cake
with a cinnamon-orange
cream cheese filling.
-That's beautiful.
-Thank you.
[Paul] Nice, moist,
full of flavour, full of texture.
-Perfectly baked.
-Heavenly cake.
-[Paul] Mmm.
-Thank you.
[Paul] Let's have a look at the key lime.
I put a bit of stem ginger in the filling.
Flavours are amazing in it.
I love the zing coming from that lime.
Tell us about this…
Chocolate and candied orange peel
Chelsea buns.
Nothing wrong with your baking, Laura.
I like Chelsea buns sort of
stretchy and squashy in the middle.
[Paul] The flavour is fantastic.
[Laura] And then the lemon macarons
are filled with lemon curd.
Great flavour, delicate.
[Prue] I love the soft middle.
You are such a good baker
and you're so good at flavour.
-Thank you. Thanks so much.
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Well done, Laura.
-Well done, Laura.
Thank you.
[exhales]
Peter, would you like
to bring your showstopper up here?
-Scary…
-You all right?
Yeah. Once I get it up, it'll be…
good to go.
I like the Christmas theme on the top.
That looks quite festive, doesn't it?
It's a battle of everything.
[Prue] I think it looks lovely.
[Peter] At the bottom,
it's a Victoria sandwich
with a strawberry jammy cream
in the middle.
Delicious flavour.
I think the flavour
and the texture is perfect.
A little drier than I thought.
You need that lovely,
thick layer of creamy strawberry.
[Peter] In the middle,
lemon and blackberry choux buns.
Blackberry is delicious.
Sharp on both, blackberry and the lemon.
It's lovely
and silky smooth inside, as well.
The choux is nicely baked.
Craquelin's worked.
I love the little Battenberg biscuits.
They're softening a bit,
but they're delicious.
-[Paul] Let's have a look at the…
-[Prue] Friands.
That's a bit disappointing.
It's got that doughy texture.
It's a bit stodgy.
[Prue] But all in all,
I think it's a good effort.
-Thank you, Peter.
-Thank you very much.
[Dave exhales]
[softly] Well done.
-Well done, Peter.
-Thanks, Dave.
Dave, would you like to bring up
your showstopper, please?
It really looks original,
enticing and very well designed.
Dangerous at the same time,
'cause what you've done is
pick things that you think
you could have done better.
So these are now perfect.
[Prue chuckles]
-[laughs]
-Just say yes.
Yes.
[Paul] Let's see the fraisier cake.
[Prue] My goodness. Look at that filling.
That is a luxury slice of cake.
This is tender as anything.
It's really lovely.
[Paul] I think it's delicious.
Beautifully light, summery cake.
-Let's look at your brownie.
-[exhales]
-This is macadamia nut and…
-[Dave] White chocolate,
and there's
dark chocolate chunks inside, too.
What we were complaining about last time
was that they were cake-like
rather than gooey.
Gooey, yeah.
Oh, I hit goo. That's better.
[Prue] That's gooey.
[Paul] You got that
light crack on the top.
You got texture and good flavour.
So they're all right.
Let's have a look at these.
[Prue] Babkas.
Last time, you struggled with a babka
because you didn't understand
what you were asked for.
Yeah, I think I took them out
of the oven a bit too early.
Ironically, you brought these out
a bit too late.
[Prue] Just what I was gonna say.
[Paul] The flavour's good,
but the dough is tough.
It should be more open than that.
Okay, let's try these choux buns.
Straightaway, they're too flat.
I also think you didn't bake them
for quite long enough.
They weren't crispy.
[Prue] They're also not helped
by having a wet filling.
Cream needed to be a bit thicker.
[Paul] Brownies, check.
Your main fraisier cake, check.
Your profiteroles and babka cakes…
still need work.
But I also think that fraisier cake is
one of the nicest things I've eaten.
-That was heaven.
-[Dave] Thank you.
-Thank you very much.
-[Paul] Well done.
[softly] Well done.
I just don't know if I've done enough.
Prue wasn't so keen on the friand.
It was a bit stodgy,
but I still love a bit of stodge.
[Laura] Having just had that feedback
and it being better than I expected,
I'm now really gutted
that I didn't do better yesterday
because I feel like
I could have done it, maybe.
I think it's definitely gonna be
between Peter and David.
And I think Dave is gonna just nab it.
[sighs] Bricking it.
I think it's gonna be so close
and we can't do anymore now.
It's all up to the judges.
[all cheering and clapping]
[Matt] Whilst the finalists join
their fellow Baking Show bubblers,
Prue and Paul have
an enormous decision to make.
You said this was delicious four times.
I'll say it again.
It was utterly delicious.
You said that was heavenly. [chuckles]
The base cake on every one of the bakers
was some of the best examples
of those cakes I've ever seen.
At the beginning of the day,
you said Laura would have to excel.
Her flavours were beautiful
on every single layer.
[Matt] But she's not in the running
to be the winner,
but the other two are.
[Prue] They are so close
because the two sponges
are both perfect.
Then we've got to judge on
the other three things.
You said this was excellent,
this was excellent.
These two could be improved.
Two of Peter's
that you thought were excellent,
two that could be improved.
They're neck and neck.
-How do you--
-It's a draw.
How on earth do you come to a decision?
This is as close to a draw
than I've ever seen.
Wow.
[all cheering and clapping]
Bakers, would you like to come
and join us, please?
[all cheering and clapping]
Congratulations on reaching the final.
Usually, you'd be here with your family,
but this year, you're here
with a different kind of family,
the amazing bubble who came together
to make this show.
And I would just like to say
a huge thank you
to everybody who worked on it
and in particular, to the medics,
to the cleaning team
and to all the staff here at the hotel
who've looked after us.
-Thank you so much.
-[all cheering]
So, it's time to find out who has won
and the judges have said
it was the closest final they've ever had
and the hardest decision
they've ever had to make.
Okay, the winner is…
-Peter.
-[all cheering and clapping]
[indistinct chatter]
It's bloody mental.
[Paul] You're the winner, mate.
Well done, bro. Amazing. Amazing.
No, I can't quite believe that I'm here.
-Thank you, Matt.
-Congratulations, Peter! Amazing! Amazing!
[Peter] I can't believe I made it here.
I can't quite believe
that the show happened.
This is gonna be
a really huge chapter of my life.
Erm…
And…
What a way for it to end.
How close was it with David and Peter?
It came down to little bits of crisp
on a choux bun.
It came down to flakes
in a rough puff pastry.
It was honestly that close.
Peter should be exceptionally proud.
He's the youngest winner we've ever had
and the first Scottish winner
we've ever had.
[Prue] I'm terribly proud of Peter.
I feel as if he's my grandson
or something,
because he's such a nice guy…
I want a picture with you.
[Prue] …and he's so eager to learn.
You can't not like him.
At my age, you feel they're all
my children or grandchildren
or maybe even
great-grandchildren. [chuckles]
[Dave] I gave Peter a good run
for his money, but he really deserves it.
I'm not disappointed at all.
If someone told me that
I would be a runner up,
I'd take that all day long.
Overjoyed and then bittersweet
because it's over,
but also looking forward to going home
and I'm just really made up
I got some flowers, to be honest.
And you really couldn't ask
for a better winner.
Like, he really does deserve it.
My flatmates told me
there's a really nice shelf
in our new flat that I can shove it on.
I wanted this a lot. [laughs]
When I was 12, watching the show,
it got me into baking, big time.
And… I think that was series three.
That's my favourite series
of the Bake Off.
James got to the final
and John won that one.
I've re-watched that series like,
probably eight or nine times.
I mean, I'm a Bake Off nerd. [laughs]
I think 12-year-old Peter would be in awe.
I think I'd believe it,
but I'd be
just the most excited, giddy kid,
which I feel like I am right now.
I am that excited, giddy kid.
[Paul] Go and show it off to that lot.
[all cheering]
[uplifting music playing]
-Hey, Andrew.
-[Andrew] Hey.
-Is everyone there?
-Yeah.
Erm…
-I just won the Bake Off.
-[all cheering]
[chuckles]
[closing theme music playing]
