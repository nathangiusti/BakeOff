*Lottie*
-They're very neat.
-Yeah.
They're perfectly cooked underneath.
Nice and thin.
So, my first quiche
is goat's cheese, beetroot and some thyme.
Lovely short pastry.
[Paul] The beetroot and the goat's cheese
with that beautiful,
buttery, crumbly base is delicious.
-Good.
-[Prue] Right. Breakfast.
This is one
where I have to put my prejudices aside.
I really don't like baked beans.
What I'm mostly getting is black pudding,
which I like.
Glad to say
I can hardly taste the baked beans.
Yeah, I didn't get
the baked beans, which is good.
They don't add
anything to the look either.
-No.
-But the pastry is the king in that.
-The pastry is very, very good.
-Thank you.

*Dave*
[Dave] So, the first one,
there's bird's eye chilli, avocado,
and top-sirloin beef.
You like bird's eye chilli?
I like Birds Eye Chicken Dippers.
[chuckling]
Sorry if it's making you more hot.
The paprika in this one,
-and cayenne, just overwhelm.
-Yeah.
-[Prue] Heavy on the spices.
-[Dave] Yeah.
-[Prue] Let's try that one.
-[Paul] Let's have breakfast.
-There is egg in there.
-Yeah.
I don't know if
that's the scrambled egg or the custard.
I like the idea of the spices
in the pastry to act like a sausage.
But I think it's ruined it,
it's too strong.
-It does taste like a sausage breakfast.
-[Paul] It does.

*Marc*
Remind us of the flavours again?
That is the smoked haddock.
The fish is delicious.
But more importantly,
the crumbliness and the butteriness
of your pastry is very, very good.
And your other, the cod is beautiful.
My only complaint is
that if you were at a party
and you had these as a choice,
they're too similar.
Yeah, yeah.

*Laura*
[Paul] Bit of leakage going on
with the chorizo.
I'm sorry, that's not happened before.
-Pastry's a little tough.
-Oh, okay.
However, I like a bit of spice.
The flavour's lovely.
[Paul] Asparagus and pea.
You've given it a nice,
delicate hint with the mint.
-Delicious.
-Lovely, thank you.

*Peter*
[Prue] These look so pretty, Peter.
Okay, let's have a look
at the Thai-inspired one.
[Peter] Yeah.
-[Prue] Very nicely cooked pastry.
-[Paul] Mmm.
I think the chilli
slightly overwhelms the fish.
'Cause crab is so delicate.
[Paul] But the wholemeal one,
it works beautifully with the salmon.
-Excellent.
-[Paul] Mmm.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

*Hermine*
[Prue] The pastry right in the middle
is a little undercooked.
I was a bit short on time.
But, actually, you've got the texture.
Holds well.
-Run through the ingredients again.
-It's shiitake mushroom and, er, spinach.
-I love that.
-Delicious.
It's such a classic combination.
And such a good one.
[exhales]
Your other… The salmon
and the leek is absolutely delicious.
-[Prue] Isn't it?
-It's creamy, the salmon's delicious,
it's buttery in the pastry.
-It's absolutely gorgeous, isn't it?
-[Prue] Mmm.
-Well done.
-Thank you, I wasn't expecting that.

*Marc*
Marc, would you like
to bring up your showstopper, please?
Considering that's an ice cream cake,
it's quite impressive.
Thank you.
Even if it wasn't an ice cream cake,
you'd say, "That's impressive."
[chuckles] It is very impressive.
-[Matt] Oh, look at that.
-[Prue] Wow. Look at that.
Yep.
Mmm. Mousse is lovely, but…
Both the ice creams are delicious…
-Bottom one's not quite set.
-I was struggling with the honey there.
You add something, so the freezing
will take a little bit longer.
-But very brave.
-It's so complicated.
There's so much happening,
-and you've pretty well done it.
-Thanks very much.

*Hermine*
-Looks nice.
-I think it looks beautiful.
I love the way
you've done the ribbon. Very good.
[Paul] Let's have a look, shall we?
Nice, neat lines.
You can see the biscuit down the bottom.
It's akin to a shortbread.
I think that's beautiful.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] I think it's so well balanced
because I put both the mango
and the coconut flavours in together,
and I can taste both distinctly.
Really good.
The Breton is beautiful
because it's buttery
and you've got a really nice eat
that, it's simple…
but highly effective.
As always, you're doing classical things
very simply, but beautifully.
-Well done, Hermine.
-Thank you.

*Peter*
-Looks great. Clever.
-It looks absolutely fantastic.
I love the decoration.
[Paul] Let's have a look, shall we?
-He's really strongly, isn't he? Oh!
-[Prue laughing]
[Prue] Remind us about your flavour.
It's a Christmas cake.
A layer of Christmas cake ice cream
and a layer of brandy cream ice cream.
Peter, that is absolutely delicious.
And it's very clever
because you've managed to freeze that
with a lot of booze in it.
Your flavours are great
but the cake's pretty solid
because of the amount of fruit
that you put in there.
By the time that's soft enough to eat,
your ice cream will be melted.
[Prue] That's absolutely true.
-But it's lovely.
-Well done.
Thank you.

*Dave*
We did point out about the ice cream
being piped on as well on the top
is a risky thing to do.
It doesn't look the best.
These, I wouldn't have bothered with.
I just didn't wanna present
something too simple.
-That's what I didn't wanna do.
-[Prue] Let's have a look.
The textures are lovely.
Chocolate is nice and strong.
[Paul] Sponges are baked beautifully
as well.
It's akin to a tiramisu,
which is what you set out.
-It doesn't look the best.
-I know.
-But I like the flavour.
-[Prue] Mmm.
-So do I.
-[Paul] Thank you.
-[Prue] Very good.
-Cool.
-[Noel] Well done.
-Cheers, thank you.

*Lottie*
[Paul] Very underwhelmed.
Did you know all the way along
that it wasn't going to freeze?
I had my suspicions because
this cassette tape idea was fairly new.
Erm, so it had been in a square cake tin
for a long time.
But without that around it, it melted.
To be honest, I think the cassette tape
is a really witty and nice idea.
-But it's not an easy thing to model.
-[Lottie] No.
No, it's not. [chuckles]
-I did try and say this morning…
-You did try and say, yeah.
…it would never work
in this temperature.
-Is it gonna taste good?
-I really hope so.
[Prue laughs]
[Lottie] Hope there's ice cream
in there still.
[grunts softly]
-Did you lose a lot of it?
-[Lottie] Yeah.
[Prue] So that looks nice.
Chocolate ice cream is delicious.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Absolutely delicious.
Is that meant to be cherry ice cream?
It's blackberry. Yeah.
-I can't get any blackberry at all.
-Okay.
I think it looks terrible.
If it tasted good, then you
sort of hang something on that.
[Lottie] Yeah.
[Paul] But besides the puffed rice
down at the bottom…
just not getting anything from it at all.
Nothing.
It's a shame.

*Laura*
-The meringue kisses look nice.
-[chuckles]
Thanks, Paul. I'll take that.
It's all a bit of, er…
on a lean, isn't it?
Yeah. It's my fault. I had issues.
Didn't press the right button
on the old ice cream machine.
So I'm really, really sorry.
-What a pity.
-You've manage to create a cake.
The tempered chocolate lost all the shine.
It is melting down the side.
But it's what it tastes like, too.
I'm sorry.
[Prue] Remind us
what the baked element is.
[Laura] It's a chocolate sponge,
a brownie in the chocolate ice cream
as well,
then the meringue on top.
[Prue] Hmm.
I think the ice cream is delicious.
The praline, it's a lovely flavour.
Yeah, your ice creams are delicious.
Just not frozen.
The big issue I have is brownie.
Why would you put a brownie
in the freezer?
What's the key element
that you look for in a brownie?
It's fudgey.
You'll never get that in a million years
if you put it in the fridge.
-Okay.
-[Paul] But the flavours are nice.
It's a pity, Laura,
because you so nearly were there.
I know. I'm sorry. Thank you.


So not quite as hot as yesterday.
Still warm.
Still a challenge to make ice cream.
Who do you think
really excelled themselves?
I thought Hermine's was very clean,
very tidy, very neat.
And beautifully made. Every element of it
was classic and perfect.
-I loved the mango.
-She's in line for Star Baker.
Yeah, she has to be. I think Hermine,
I would even say that Marc's pulled
himself up into a situation of Star Baker.
You were very, very impressed
when Marc presented his cake.
-[Prue] It was so ambitious.
-Who's at the bottom?
I actually think Dave's saved himself
today with that tiramisu cake.
I think it's Lottie or Laura.
Lottie's been quite erratic.
She's either brilliant…
-[Paul] Yeah.
-…or a bit chaotic.
And Laura's been in the bottom a lot.
She's… She's made a lot of mistakes.
Every showstopper,
she's fighting to stay in the competition.
She is. I think it's between
Lottie and Laura again.
Well, well done to you guys
for choosing an ice cream cake challenge
-in one of the hottest days--
-We didn't know that, did we?
-We didn't know that.
-You knew.
We don't have higher information.
That is not what the Daily Mail
are gonna say.
-They know. They know. Devious.
-[Noel chuckles]
Well done, bakers.
You've all worked very, very hard.
And now it's down to me
to say which one of you is Star Baker.
All of you have been Star Baker once,
except Hermine…
until now. Congratulations.
-Thank you.
-[all clapping]
-Thank you.
-Well done.
Yay!
-Well deserved.
-Yeah.
Ah, that means I've got the horrible job
of announcing the person who's leaving us.
This gets tough. It does get tough
because you're all our little buddies now.
But…
the person who is going home today…
is…
Lottie.
-Aww. Cat Face.
-Don't be nice to me.
-[Marc] We know.
-[Noel] Why, Cat Face?
-[softly] Why?
-I had to.
-Who am I gonna muck about with now?
-[Lottie chuckles]
Just give me a minute. [crying]
It's just like a massive relief,
but also, like,
obviously, I'm gutted
to see everyone, like…
Not be with everyone every day.
Honestly, it's been amazing.
It has been amazing.
Can you stop crying please, Laura?
Thank you.
I think, mixed emotions
definitely right now.
Really happy I got through, but erm…
yeah, Lottie is a really good friend.
Beneath the sarcastic, tough exterior
is actually a really kind, really funny,
really lovely human being.
So yeah, I think at the moment,
I just feel a bit sad
that I've… I've lost Lottie.
-[Peter] I'll miss you.
-I'll miss you.
-[Peter] I'm sorry.
-[Lottie] We'll have a whisky tonight.
I literally packed two outfits.
And I'm here in week seven,
wearing everyone else's clothes.
I cannot believe the stuff that I've done.
I got a handshake, I got a Star Baker.
Like, I'm so chuffed with myself.
And maybe I can bake.
Maybe I can.
-[Prue] Hermine, well done.
-Thank you.
I was absolutely thrilled
that Hermine finally got Star Baker
because honestly, in a way,
she's deserved it
two or three times before,
but she's just been pipped
by a tiny margin.
Well done. I'll miss you, too.
[Hermine] It was a lovely thing to hear.
Cherry on the icing.
But as they always say,
keep my head on my shoulder
and keep going. [chuckles]
I know. Ooh!
Check you out! [chuckles]
-You all right?
-Yeah.
-Did you hear?
-Yeah.
-Oh, you happy for me?
-Yeah.
Oh, lovely.
I'm proud of you.
Aw! [laughing]
