*Mark*
They're quite impressive.
I like the stout one.
It's the colour I expected it to be.
This has been coloured a bit
but I don't really mind that,
to be honest.
[Mark] It's got sobrasada
and an Irish sheep smoked cheddar.
[Paul] It's a decent soda bread.
There's flavour in there,
but you've got to hunt it.
[Prue] It's delicious with the top,
then you really get the flavour.
[Mark] And then, I've got
chocolate and Irish stout.
The chocolate comes through.
[Paul] Very good.
You get the chocolate instantly.
Then the stout lingers.
-A great loaf.
-[Prue] The butter's lovely.
-Good job.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
-Well done.

*Laura*
[Paul] They look quite rustic,
but both the same size.
They look quite nice.
The onions and the chorizo
go really well together.
-A little underbaked.
-[Prue] It's a pity, the edge is perfect.
[Paul] Glacé cherry bread.
Look at that.
[Paul] Can't taste the glacéed cherries,
but the marzipan is delicious.
The marzipan comes whacking through.
It's just lovely.

*Lottie*
-[Matt] There's a good crunch.
-[Paul] Mmm.
[Prue] It's a really lovely texture.
Beautiful.
[Paul] A great tasting loaf.
-[Prue] Yes.
-You've chosen flavours
that work in all breads,
and olive is one of those.
[Lottie] And my sweet
is blueberry and maple bacon.
Well, the blueberries
are not exactly evenly spread, are they?
When I get a blueberry, it's delicious,
the texture's good.
I'm missing the bacon.
It's wasted on the outside.
Lot of it's gonna end up on the plate
and you won't taste it.
-Thank you.
-[Lottie] Thank you.

*Peter*
[Paul] They look great.
It's very brave to take
the gluten-free option.
Difficult though, isn't it?
It's falling to bits a bit
-and then it gets glue-y in your mouth.
-Okay.
-[Paul] This is the ginger?
-Ginger beer.
I love the honey, texture's beautiful.
Very cake-like, though, isn't it?
It's a little bit stodgy.
The flavours are delicious.
Your flavours are normally spot-on.

*Marc*
-[Paul] Very rustic.
-[Prue] They look classic.
-They're really good.
-[Paul] Hmm.
I love that.
-Really?
-Mmm. It's a nice loaf.
If you get a mouthful of everything,
it's delicious.
Thank you very much.
-[Paul] Okay.
-[Prue] This is a little doughier.
-[Paul] More cake-like.
-Nice flavour, though.
-It's cranberries, is it?
-Cranberries, chocolates, and sea salt.
Not getting the cranberry.
It's just a little bit weak.
Needs a bit more.
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thank you.

*Rowan*
They both look as if
they haven't risen enough.
-There are very big lumps of sausage.
-Yes.
[Rowan laughs]
-You always like a lot of sausage?
-Wouldn't care to comment.
-Okay, fair enough.
-[chuckles]
Actually, the sausage is okay,
the olives are okay.
-I would have left the bread in longer.
-Right.
-[Paul] See how wet--
-[Prue] That's why it's so heavy.
[Prue] It'd be nice if it was lighter.
[Paul] Wow.
That much polenta in there was a mistake.
It's too gritty for me.
It's a bit like eating
a lemon drizzle cake in a sandstorm.
[laughs]

*Dave*
[Prue] Looks as if it's risen nicely.
-Not enough flavour for me.
-[Dave] No?
-You put Gruyère?
-[Dave] Yes.
-You need double that, triple that.
-Yeah. Okay.
You do get the chocolate,
just not enough in each bite.
It's a shame,
'cause it's baked well, actually.
[Prue] Two very good loaves.
You just need a bit more flavour.

*Sura*
[Paul] Let's try the za'atar one first.
-[Prue] What oven temperature did you use?
-160.
[Paul] That's why it's so pale.
The blend of olives
and za'atar is delicious.
[Prue] I like the flavour.
Right, sweet one.
Are the fruits mostly apricots?
[Sura] Apricots,
dried cherries, and walnut.
-I think that is delicious.
-Thank you.
Really, really good.
My only issue of both loaves
is your temperature choice.
You should've baked them higher
and it would've been spot-on.
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

*Linda*
[Paul] Looks good, but I hope
it's baked all the way through.
I get worried when they're that pale.
Needed a little longer in the oven.
It's such a pity
because the flavour is lovely.
That's a bit soggy, too.
Does have that spicy
bara brith flavour to it.
When you try and push
a load of fruit into a loaf,
if you shape it too tight,
all the fruit goes to the outside.
There's nothing inside.
I like the flavour,
but unfortunately, all the fruit burnt
-on the top of the loaf, not in it.
-Yeah.

*Hermine*
[Paul] They look really nice.
The idea of putting
the smoked salmon in it is so original.
I've never had that.
-You invented a bread.
-[whispering] Yeah!
That, I really like.
The salmon really works.
It's like a whole sandwich all in one.
The aftertaste is lovely.
-It's nice and well-baked.
-Thank you.
-That's a very grown-up fruit cake.
-[Prue] Mmm.
Lots of booze. Lovely.
I've soaked the fruit
for a couple of weeks.
You serious?
-[Prue] She wanted us to taste it.
-[Paul] Wow.
-[Prue] Lovely.
-Thank you.
I think they're very special. I really do.
-[all exclaiming and clapping]
-[Hermine] Oh!
Thank you.
Know what I love?
The fact that I've never had them before.
-Thank you.
-This has really complex flavours.
I love it. It's special.
Well done.

*Hermine*
Hermine, would you like
to bring up your showstopper?
Looks a bit abstract.
-[Prue] You're driving through vineyards?
-[Hermine] Yes.
-These?
-That's supposed to be farmer's field
-and a tractor.
-[Prue] A tractor.
-Yes.
-[Paul] I see, okay.
You've lost a bit of definition
in the swirl on the outside,
but overall, it looks good.
Let's have a look
at the frame to start with.
This is the brioche.
[Hermine] Yes.
-And the main bit is the focaccia.
-Yeah.
The brioche doesn't hold much flavour.
I knew you were gonna struggle
to get that out in time.
It's an enriched dough
but it's not a brioche.
-[Prue] Focaccia's lovely.
-Thank you.
It's springy. I like both, actually.
The focaccia is not bad.
But I do like the design.
-It's very, very good.
-Thank you.

*Sura*
I think it looks quite dramatic
and effective.
[Paul] The plait on the outside
is not bad.
[Prue] I like the effect you've got
by interlacing the two.
Texture looks good.
I think that is beautifully seasoned.
The tomato bread is nice.
It's got a nice zing.
But more importantly, it's the structure,
the air bubbles, it's regular,
and it's even all the way down.
-It's a nice loaf.
-Thank you.
Did you try one of the balls?
They've got feta inside.
[Prue] Mmm.
That is delicious.
-Can I go?
-Yes, absolutely.
-[all laughing]
-Your agony is over.
-[Noel] Well done, Sura.
-Thank you.

*Laura*
I love your Victorian swags
of great velvet curtain.
Your gilded tassels are wonderful.
It's simple but effective.
-Shall we have a look?
-[Prue] Yeah.
[Laura] It's a focaccia base
with pancetta and cheese.
[Prue] It's got quite a punch.
Your ingredient choices are good.
The problem is focaccia
is a very, very light dough
and you put that
on top of it so it couldn't rise.
So what it did is
concertina back down again
and so it feels quite raw.
[Prue] It's a pity, because when you get
the edge of the focaccia,
it's really nice bread.
The chili bread's got a kick to it.
Not bad at all.
I think it's full of flavour.
but textures weren't right.

*Peter*
It's simple, sort of effective.
I think you could've done more with it.
Your flavours are coming from
the seeds on the top of the dried herbs.
They carry through.
-It's a nice eat.
-[Prue] It tastes very nice.
I just feel it's a little dense and tough.
[Paul] You made a bagel like a pitta.
-It's a little weird.
-[laughs] It is, isn't it?
A bread shouldn't do that.
It's like a piece of leather.
Oh, Peter.

*Lottie*
The design's pretty good.
You kept some definition in there, too.
[Prue] The bread is well risen,
it feels great,
-but it lacks flavour.
-Okay.
-And this is tomato and paprika.
-Yes.
Yeah, tomato, paprika and chorizo.
-That packs a punch. That's nice.
-[Prue] Yes.
[Paul] Nice balance of flavour with it.
Nice bread. Should've done more with that…
-[Prue] Very nice.
-…rather than the white.

*Linda*
I like the concept,
I like the design, I love the cow.
We drunk milk straight from the cow
when we was children.
-From the udders?
-Not quite.
-[Noel] Wow.
-[Linda laughs]
[Paul] Remind me of the flavour again?
It's olive and tiger bread.
That's not tiger bread topping.
It's the flavours of it,
but not so much the cracking.
[Paul] Okay.
-[Prue] It's dense.
-[Paul] Needs more olives.
More proving's needed.
More flavour's needed.

*Mark*
Interesting trees.
Little bit bulky
compared to the rest of it.
[Prue] I like the bee.
[Paul] The plaiting's a little bit
irregular, thick and then thin.
The structure's not bad, because actually,
you do have a light crust.
It is wetter on the mouth,
which is what you want.
Flavour's not that strong, though,
considering you're using wild garlic,
you should be getting
a serious kick from that.
This one's got apple and cinnamon?
[Mark] In the middle, yeah.
Mmm. The apple
and cinnamon is really nice.
It's a bit basic, the picture,
but the bread is okay.

*Marc*
Well, it looks really surprising
and pretty, and quite neat.
Certainly colourful.
If you dig deeper around the edges,
it's a bit weak on the plaiting.
It's slightly underproved,
-and ripped in the oven.
-Okay.
But this particular area here is gorgeous.
-[Marc] Thank you.
-Really nice. Neat, clever.
[Matt] It's intricate detail, isn't it?
[Prue] Oh, look.
That looks like nice bread.
[Paul] The flavour of the brown's not bad.
-It could do with more salt.
-[Marc] Okay.
[Paul] Fennel one is nice.
Overall, I like those flavours.
-Thank you.
-I think you've done a really good job.
It looks good, tastes good,
smells good. It is good.
-Great.
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thank you very much.
-Well done.

*Dave*
Your wife's pregnant?
Yes. Although I do look
more pregnant than she does.
[laughs] I was gonna say.
It's called sympathetic pregnancy.
[Paul] I would've spent time
cutting bricks out
and placed them on
and just built up that brickwork look.
You sort of get it,
but it would look nice with that.
Okay.
[Prue] This is the one with--
Mango, lime and chili paste
running through.
You certainly get
the mango and the chilli.
[Paul] I like the flavour.
Never had anything like that.
But I think the bread's a little too dry.
-It's overbaked.
-Okay.
[Paul] The flavour of the base?
That is hibiscus and guava flavour drops.
I've never met guava flavour.
Never had an Um Bongo, Prue?
-[Matt] Never been to the Congo?
-[Prue] I know guavas well,
-but I've never known it as an essence.
-Right.
And I can't really taste it.
[Paul] The ideas are unique.
Never tried either before.
Just that the baking was a little too far.
-Yeah. Fair enough.
-[Paul] Thank you.

*Rowan*
[Prue] Well, Rowan. [chuckles]
I think it looks great.
I think it looks quite attractive.
Very big.
-[Prue] What's the bread?
-[Rowan] Worcestershire, blue cheese
and pears soaked in local cider.
[Prue] Get the cider.
Where's the blue cheese?
-Well, I pressed it in.
-You pressed it in?
That's why we don't get the taste.
-[Rowan] Right.
-I would've mixed it in the dough.
And you needed much more proving in that.
Keeping these restrained to keep the look.
You've gone for all style
and no substance.
You've ended up with a bread
which is quite bland.
-Right.
-[Paul] What's the flavour of that one?
That is chestnut and walnut.
Again, walnuts, lot more.
It's such a pity,
'cause that's much nicer bread.
Should we try the earthy one?
I can smell the truffle.
Definitely has more flavour,
but it could do with some salt.
-Okay. [chuckles]
-[Paul] Thank you very much.
[Rowan] Many thanks.


[Matt] How do you think that went?
Overall, the standard wasn't good.
I think they feel a lot of pressure
on Bread Week to impress you
and often, they implode.
They needed to come in strong.
If you're not confident, it shows.
[Prue] Sura and Marc E,
those two worked with terrific confidence
and they're bang in your face.
They both managed to get
the right texture, the right flavour,
the right look.
-So, Star Baker, Marc E and Sura.
-Yeah.
What about Hermine?
She had a handshake.
Hermine has got a possibility.
Technical wasn't brilliant.
And her showstopper,
I didn't like the enriched dough.
Who do you think's at the bottom?
-Obviously Rowan. Anyone else?
-[Paul] Peter's in trouble.
I also think David's in trouble.
-Our two previous Star Bakers.
-Yeah.
[Matt] In defence of Rowan,
his showstopper really looked like
a showstopper, didn't it?
Again, style and substance.
It lacked flavour.
But how much flavour
do breads really need?
-You've crossed the line.
-I've crossed the line.
Do you wanna fight, Matt?
So, bakers, congratulations.
I know it's been a long couple of days.
One of you is Star Baker
and that person is…
Marc E.
-Wow.
-[all clapping]
Oh, bakers, that means
I've got the horrible job
of sending someone home.
[sighs] The person who is leaving us is…
Rowan.
That's fine. [laughs]
These boots were made for walking.
[laughing]
I feel very content, really.
I've had a wonderful time.
Erm, it is exhausting, but very rewarding.
Bring it in. Bring it in, kids.
[Mark] Sorry, Rowan.
And I was also quite pleased
that Noel said to me,
"I'm all style and no substance."
He said, "It's on my CV." [laughs]
[Hermine] Gonna miss those laughs.
[Rowan] Oh!
Rowan's been such a character.
I'm sorry to see him go
because he is so ambitious
and so imaginative
and he puts so much thought
into his baking.
He delivered a showstopper
which was very impressive to look at,
but it just didn't taste good.
[Laura] Gonna miss you, Rowan.
Such mixed emotions.
Sad for Rowan, ecstatic for Marc
'cause he really deserved
and needed that for his confidence.
I just got Star Baker, didn't I?
On Bread Week.
It's the thing that I enjoy making.
It's the thing that started me on
this whole baking experience.
To get Star Baker is amazing.
-[Paul] Well done.
-Thank you.
It was really good.
Marc did really well in the signature.
Pretty well in the technical, too.
And in the showstopper,
he managed to get his dough risen
and tasting good.
So, the whole Buddhist ethos
really worked for him.
Hey! [chuckles]
-Well done for being Star Baker.
-Thank you.
Hey, Gibbygibs.
-Thank you, girls.
-[girl] Love you.
[Marc] I love you, too. You're the best.
Thank you.
Oh, you made me get emotional now.
