*George*
[Paul] I know you did the dough again.
-Is this your second or your first?
-Second.
[Paul] It's packed
and I like that in a focaccia.
Sort of busy.
-[Prue] I think that's lovely, George.
-Thank you.
The bake is good. You created a good blend
of flavours all the way through.
You just needed a little bit
more water to open it up a bit more.
But I think you're sort of
85% of the way there.
And you were definitely right
to redo the dough.
Yeah.

*Maggie*
[Prue] Looks very attractive.
[Paul] It's gotta be pushed down
till you feel the tray.
-[Maggie] Oh, right.
-That far down.
I like that stretchy soft texture.
It's very soft on the top,
which defeats the object a little bit.
But I do like the flavours.
I love the thyme in there.
Maybe a little bit more mixing.
-But overall, it's a decent focaccia.
-Thank you. [chuckles]

*Freya*
[Paul] This smells great.
The texture's nice.
I get the pepper and the cayenne
in there, little hint of paprika.
It's well baked.
I'm really relieved,
because I thought it was going
to be over-spiced and it's not.
-It's really delicately done.
-Ah, thank you!

*Rochica*
[Paul] Love the design on the top
like you've scorched it.
-Wow.
-[Prue] That's all garlic.
-Strong, isn't it?
-Yeah. [laughs]
The texture is okay.
The problem is it's very strong of garlic.
I would have put the garlic on the top,
pushed it in.
In this piece there isn't any,
but loads in this one.
It's about keeping it all regular.
Let's ask the vampire
what you think of that.
Yeah, I can't go near that. [chuckling]
-[Paul] He backs away from it as well.
-[chuckling]

*Amanda*
It's overbaked.
Needed to come out five minutes before.
-You put the filling in lines, didn't you?
-Yeah.
[Prue] Think I prefer it scattered
so you get a bit of everything.
If you'd put less flavours,
one of everything in one bite,
then you'd have smashed it.
Thank you.

*Chigs*
When you put cheese on like this,
you end up with a dry spot,
and then you're going to have
exposed areas of dough.
And that'll always catch.
So what you've done is over-baked this.
-The flavours are lovely. Really powerful.
-[Chigs] Yeah?
-Great flavours there.
-It's delicious.

*Crystelle*
It's quite an open structure,
but it needed to be much, much thicker.
That's beautiful, annoyingly thin.
-Okay.
-It needed to be a little bit thicker.
And that was beautiful.
Great flavour combination.
And it's so unusual because it's so fresh.
Highly unusual, but beautiful.
-Well done.
-[Paul] Thank you.
[sighs] Thank you!

*Lizzie*
[Prue] It looks really nice.
[Paul] It's got a nice top,
it's fairly equal.
You've filled the tin quite nicely.
I think it's lovely. Good flavour,
nice and soft, crisp on the outside.
You could've proved it a little bit longer
just to open it up a little bit more,
but you have an irregular
structure with a crispy top
and a fantastic flavour and colour,
so I can't fault it that much.
-I think it's a great focaccia.
-Ta.

*Jurgen*
-[Paul] It's slightly over-baked.
-Mmm-hmm.
[Paul] You have a big wet spot
that runs down there along the base.
More proving and less baking.
It's quite tight inside.
It needed more mixing.
It does break pretty easily.
It's more cake-like than bread-like.
Jürgen, I'm not absolutely mad
about the flavours.
I normally love kippers.
I just think it could have been
a little bit better.

*Giuseppe*
It's the sort of focaccia
that I would bake,
-but let's have a look inside, shall we?
-Yes.
It's really nice. It's soft,
and yet it's got the focaccia structure.
[Paul] Shows it's proved correctly.
But the thing that I particularly like,
you haven't gone overboard with flavour.
And made a beautifully light focaccia.
And you get a mouthful
of everything on every bite.
-That's what focaccia is.
-Thank you.

*George*
-I think he's adorable.
-[Paul] It's simple, but it works.
[Prue] Lovely.
The bread's a bit heavy.
The thing is, when you do
stand-up milk bread sculptures,
the dough is so soft, it will collapse.
-Yeah.
-[Paul] It works on a koala.
'Cause it's quite charming.
But it's concertinaed up
because it can't carry the weight.
But I think the design is clever enough,
and your base one…
This is nice. It's just sweet enough.
-[Prue] Well done, George.
-Thank you very much.

*Lizzie*
You've caught a few of them in the oven.
-Yeah.
-But I quite like that.
-Looks like it's been on a barbecue.
-[both laughing]
But the overall design
I think is very clever.
The pig was probably up here,
and it's dropped a bit.
So basically you've got mango tea.
Yeah. I did have a pet pig,
so, it's called, er, Susie.
What happened to Susie?
She slipped on ice,
we had to get her put down.
[all chuckling]
Slipped on ice?
-Yeah.
-Don't take pigs ice-skating.
She was living in the garden,
the ground got icy.
I like the texture. And it is light.
You can get that tea, can't you?
-Not sure whether I like it, but, erm…
-Quite perfumed.
But I can identify it,
that's the key thing.
-Thank you, Lizzie.
-Ta.

*Chigs*
It's beautifully done.
[Paul] It's not bad.
It looks quite well-proved.
You can see how round it is.
[Prue] I think that's really well made.
But I don't get
a lot of orange blossom flavour.
You get a hint of something
slightly aromatic at the back.
It's light, it's fluffy.
The textures and colours
are pretty consistent.
-It's a nice bread, that.
-[Prue] Very nice.
Good design.
Simple but highly effective as well.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done, Chigs.

*Maggie*
It's quite abstract. Looks quite rustic,
and then this looks quite neat.
Yes.
Is that four and a half hours'
worth of work?
Well, it was for me.
[all laughing]
Good answer.
[continues laughing]
It's under-proved and it's got no flavour.
I'm hard-pushed
to find the seaweed in that.
See, there's simply not enough in it.
The sweetness is there,
but it's very cake-like.
Could be a bit lighter.
But I honestly think
if you put a bit of salt in it,
you'd have the flavour,
because I can get the seaweed.
But there's no doubt
that salt would enhance it.
[Maggie]
Well, that's rather disappointing.
-But never mind.
-[Paul] Yeah, it is.
-Thank you, Maggie.
-Thank you.

*Jurgen*
The way you've incorporated
different flavours
in different breads is very clever.
The baby…
[Paul and Prue chuckle]
…is very basic,
but it does work, it's effective.
Colour looks great on the bread as well.
You glazed this?
I glazed it with egg wash. Egg wash.
Lovely flavour.
-[Prue] Very good flavour.
-The sweetness level's just right.
But for me, it is slightly under-proved,
and therefore
you haven't got that structure.
So, nearly there.
-[Paul] Thank you, Jürgen.
-Thank you.

*Crystelle*
It's very clever.
And you've created a theme.
The chicken could have been a bit higher.
-Spatchcock.
-Uh, yeah.
[Prue] It's definitely
a spatchcock or a turtle.
I think your craqueline
could've been a bit darker.
-[Crystelle] Okay.
-[Paul] A bit longer in the oven
would've created more of a darkness to it.
The flavours are great, though.
The citrus kick is fantastic.
The top is beautiful.
The texture is lovely. It's light.
It's got a nice sweetness to it,
which is just right.
-It's really a nice slice of bread.
-Thank you very much.

*Giuseppe*
I think the design is incredible.
You've done an amazing job.
It's actually quite simple,
but you've executed it beautifully.
Paul's never had fruit or veg before.
He only eats bread.
So can you tell us what each one is?
So you've got a courgette--
-He is as well.
-[all laughing]
Apples and mushrooms, yeah.
The texture in there,
it's light, it bounces back.
And the flavour's in there as well.
It's difficult to get orange
to come through in bread,
but you get the zest,
which is a much purer form of orange.
I think you've done
something that's, erm, very clever.
It's absolutely delicious.
And I think the texture's lovely.
-Well done, Giuseppe.
-Thank you.

*Amanda*
I think you've done a really good job.
You've lost a lot of definition,
but you've utilized that to your strengths
to make the octopus the way it does.
It's very clever and effective.
I think it's delightful.
You can see how tender the loaf is.
I love that. I love the flavour.
The sweetness is just the right side
of sweetness, and the texture is spot-on.
But it's not bouncy.
You've ended up
with a massive air pocket in there.
But I think it's very good,
very brioche-like.
-It's light, it's well-baked.
-I think you've done a terrific job.
-Well done.
-Thank you so much.

*Rochica*
There's something wrong
with the proportions.
That little bird, even if it was upright,
couldn't have laid those eggs
in a million years.
It's over-proved.
You've lost it 'cause it's going flat.
It's a bit tight.
It's under-proved as well.
This is going to prove
at a slightly different level to this.
-[Rochica] Oh, okay.
-[Paul] Because it's smaller pieces.
The cinnamon level's right.
Sweetness level's right as well.
Just that the dough's too dense.
And when you say
that's four and a half hours' work,
I wouldn't believe you.
Erm, that does taste absolutely delicious.
But the texture's not right.
-[Paul] Thank you, Rochica.
-Thank you.

*Freya*
[Prue] I think it's really very amusing.
And I must say that the crab shell
is so realistic.
-It's beautifully done.
-I like it, it's very neat.
Let's have a look.
Is the beach demerara sugar
or soft brown sugar?
Yeah, it's soft brown sugar.
Nice milk bread.
The structure's light, holds its shape.
And the sweetness levels
are just right as well.
-It's not overly sweet.
-It's nicely baked.
Tastes good, and I love the look of it.
I think it's just hilarious.


[Matt] So where are we at?
Milk bread's quite difficult
to do properly.
I think most of them
did a pretty good job.
Simplicity was the way forward.
And I think Giuseppe got that.
What Giuseppe has done is clever.
-[Noel] What about Freya?
-[Paul] I would say Freya was up there.
She has done well.
There's a few people
who are sort of middle ground,
and I thought Jürgen saved himself.
-George is--
-Lizzie is doing well.
Lizzie really excelled, I think.
What about Maggie?
-[Paul] Maggie struggled.
-[Prue] I think she's in trouble.
I didn't get the flavours in that.
I thought the structure
wasn't particularly good.
I think it was a little bit too simple.
I think the two people,
I think Maggie and I also think Rochica.
The trouble with Rochica's
is that the whole thing didn't work
because there wasn't
a loaf of bread there,
and we're trying to judge bread.
But I really like them all now.
I don't want anybody to go home.
This is quite a hard point to leave,
because they're just
getting to know each other now…
-Settled--
-Settling into the life
of the prison camp where we film.
[all chuckling]
To be fair, a lot of them
have tried to escape already.
Well done, bakers. Big week, bread week.
Especially in front
of the breadfather, Paul.
It's a tough one,
but you all did really well.
I've got the great job this week
of announcing who is Star Baker.
The person who's Star Baker this week is…
-Giuseppe.
-[all applauding]
Yeah! Bravo!
Now I have the less fun job of telling you
who's going to be going home,
and it gets harder and harder each week
because we're becoming friends
and we're bonding.
And we don't want to lose anyone.
But I'm afraid
we are going to be losing somebody,
and that person is…
Rochica.
[Freya] It's okay.
[Rochica] It's come to end,
but I have really, really enjoyed it.
And not everybody gets to bake
in the Bake Off tent.
So I'm proud of where I've got to.
And I'm just going to keep baking.
Just don't do anything to,
like, time. [laughs]
-We're gonna miss you.
-I'll miss you too.
-Just getting to know you.
-I know, right?
[Maggie] Your family
will be so happy to see you.
[laughing] I think
I was very close to the edge.
The cliff was crumbling rather badly,
but I seem to have scraped through again.
-Well done, Maggie.
-I don't know how I keep doing it.
-Squeak through.
-Squeak through.
Next week,
I've got to be spectacular. [snorts]
[Jürgen] Can't win them all.
Can't win all the Star Bakers.
It feels very good to be
at the end of Bread Week and still in.
-[Prue] So deserved, really.
-Thank you.
Star Baker, can you believe that?
Especially for Bread Week.
I better savour it 'cause
it ain't gonna happen again. [laughs]
