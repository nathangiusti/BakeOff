Kim-Joy
-They look pretty even.
-[Paul] Hmm.
[Paul] Got a nice colour on em.
The tangzhong,
it's gonna be interesting to see
how that affects the dough.
I think it's offered up
a very delicate dough.
It's quite soft,
which is good for a Chelsea bun.
So, I think your baking is very good.
I like the flavours.
Is there citrus in there as well?
Yeah, a little bit.
That's the overriding flavour
that you get.
I think it's delicate and it needs to be
a little more obvious.

*Manon*
[Prue] They're heart shaped, aren't they?
[Manon] Yes.
Very neat. Slightly overbaked.
[Prue] The edges definitely tough.
[Paul] The flavour's fantastic.
The marzipan really works with the fruit
and the apricots as well.
The dough has got a gorgeous structure.
If you brought it out five, seven minutes
earlier, they would have been perfect.
Okay.

*Dan*
[Paul] They're all even.
Got a nice colour.
They break apart neatly.
Absolutely delicious.
Really sticky on the outside.
Great orange. Bang of flavour.
Oh, really good.
Dan...
-Ah.
-It's perfect.
-Thank you.
-[all clapping]
It's annoyingly perfect
and I'll tell you why.
Your structures are regular,
it's beautiful and soft.
Your interior has a good
overwhelming orange flavour
and even the decoration
sits on top beautifully.
It's a well-made Chelsea bun that.
Dan, we're in love with you.
-[exhales]
-[laughing]
Well done.

*Antony*
[Paul] I think it looks impressive.
It's overbaked.
It shouldn't be crispy.
The structure's good.
Soft but the outside is tough.
Hmm.
The overall impression is of dryness,
which is such a pity because the flavours,
once you swallow everything,
is just fantastic.
[Paul] One of the qualities
of peanut butter is that it's very dry.
When you have a dough that's very dry
what you're getting is dry.
Stop saying dry, everyone.
Everyone, stop saying dry.
-[laughs]
-Thanks, Noel.

*Terry*
[Paul] I think they look
like the ones I make.
[Prue] Looks lovely.
Tastes great.
The dough's beautiful and soft.
The sweetness is about right too.
But spread the fruit more evenly
so you don't get these big gaps.
If you had hit the filling, it's perfect.
Thank you.

*Briony*
They look really pretty,
but they've exploded a bit, haven't they?
[Briony] I know they have, yeah.
[Paul] It hasn't been folded properly
and neatly enough.
Right, okay.
Lovely and light. Nice dough.
I think that's delicious.
Oh, yay.
The flavour is very, very good.
It's a shame it looks the way it does.
Okay. Yeah, okay. Thank you.

*Karen*
[Prue] Do you know,
I think it looks really pretty.
Lovely flavour.
-Good.
-Structure is lovely.
-It is well baked.
-Oh, good.
I love bakewell but I've had it
a few times from you now.
Next bake you do please don't put anymore.
I was thinking though,
you say signature, isn't that something
-you always take everywhere you go?
-Hmm.
-Well, there you go.
-There you go.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

*Ruby*
Did you have sugar in your dough?
I didn't, but there was sugar
in the carrot mixture.
It's not enough.
This feels hard. It feels crusty.
-It's not how a Chelsea bun should be.
-Right. Okay.
I think that flavour's very interesting
but I think it fundamentally lacks that...
-Yeah.
-...stickiness.
Mixture in a Chelsea bun don't work.
Oh, okay.
[whispers] I'll have a word with him.
Yeah, have a word.

*Jon*
[Paul] Well, I do like what you've done.
It's quite impressive.
[Prue] It looks nice and spongy.
I think it feels slightly overbaked.
It's overbaked.
-It is?
-Hmm.
It should be much softer
than that on the palate.
Flavour's absolutely delicious.
Yes. That's what I wanted.
I like the decoration
but not so fine a Chelsea bun.
All right. I'll put a liver bird
on the next one, how's that? [chuckles]

*Rahul*
I'm sorry about
that much fruit on the top.
[Noel] Are you trying to match my jumper?
[Prue] Well, it does look a bit messy
-but I must say...
-[Rahul] Yeah.
...it looks delicious.
Pulls apart lovely.
It's very soft and gooey,
which is way a Chelsea bun should be.
It's very interesting.
Such savoury spices.
I mean there's such a contrast
to the sweet fruit
but I really like that.
[Paul] It's baked to perfection.
I think the mango chutney is stunning.
Very clever, Rahul.
-That's a very good Chelsea bun.
-Thank you.

Kim-Joy, please bring up your showstopper.
[Kim-Joy] Not sure.
[Noel] Trust me?
-Yeah.
-I'm a bit of a clutz.
I'm not sure you should have...
Should not have trusted him, Kim-Joy.
This is a shotgun wedding, isn't it?
I mean there are an awful lot
of kittens already.
[all laughing]
[Sandi] Thats their friends.
[Prue] Oh, they're friends.
They're their friends.
I think the bread looks incredible.
It's a lovely bit of plait work as well
and I think the cats are amazing.
It really is charming.
[Paul] Right, let's have a look.
[Prue] That looks lovely.
-Quite like a hot cross bun, isn't it?
-It is, yeah.
Kind of liked a little more fruit in it.
[Paul] And it's bit tight.
So it's a little bit cake like.
Another half an hour proving
that would have been perfect.
Tastes good though.
-And it's certainly celebratory.
-[Paul] Thank you
-Thank you
-[Prue] Thank you

*Rahul*
[Paul] We wanted
a highly decorative korovai
-and that's it.
-That's it.
[Prue] It really is a showstopper.
The detail of the swans
and the decorations
are just absolutely lovely.
[Paul] I hope it tastes
as good as it looks.
[Prue] Oh, look at that.
I like that texture. It's like panettone.
That's fantastic.
You can see the swirls of the dough.
The fruit in there is delicious
and that orange tang.
You're a little genius, Rahul.
Thank you.
-Thank you.
-Well done, Rahul.
[sighs]

*Dan*
It's simple and effective.
The colour of the bakes are consistent.
Dan, you must have spent a long time
on the decorations
and they are absolutely exquisite.
And a lovely texture.
Beautifully baked.
It really is. The structure that
you've managed to achieve
is very brioche like.
But it needs something else.
It needs fruit in there.
The flavour is not strong enough.
Okay. [sighs]

*Ruby*
The attention to detail on the decoration
is spectacular.
Particularly when you look at the hearts,
the plaiting is very, very good.
[Prue] Lots of filling.
I love the almond flavour.
Perfection.
I've made a lot of couronnes in my time
but the bake that laces its way
through the fruit
is to be applauded.
Thank you.
That is absolutely stunning.
I could eat the whole thing.
Oh, my goodness.
[Paul] Thank you.
[clapping]
Great job, Ruby.

*Jon*
[Prue] It's certainly colourful
but it does look a bit clumsy.
[Paul] I think what you've done is,
you've put two very heavy breads
on top of a bread that's warm.
The whole thing's sunk in.
Yeah. I'm not happy
with it at all, to be honest.
[Prue] And it's a bit heavy
where it's squashed together.
You've got too much fruit in there.
The flavour of it is fantastic.
Well, thank you for that.
I just think the texture, the look,
the whole thing is an issue.
-Bad luck, Jon. Not perfect.
-Thank you, Jon.
Thanks.

*Karen*
My goodness.
[laughs]
I like the fact that
they're muted colours.
-Yeah.
-It's lovely.
[Paul] I think the decoration's
incredible. It's intricate.
I do look at the colour of the bread
and wonder what it's like inside.
-So do I. I have to say.
-[Prue laughs]
[all laughing]
[Prue] The bread's a bit
doughy in the middle.
[Paul] You've had to give it
that strong colour to try and bake it
because it's underproved.
It's so disappointing
because it looks so amazing.
It show stops from the outside.
Bit of a stopper in the inside.
No problem.
-[Paul] Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

*Antony*
[Antony] Just to add to the drama.
Hoping these lovebirds
go down the zip line.
[all] Ah!
[clapping]
[Paul] It's simple but effective.
I worry about the colour of that
and it could be down to the chocolate.
And there are not very many decorations.
[Antony] Yeah, I did have a problem
with time management, unfortunately.
So I couldn't
get all my décor on the cake.
It's a bit heavy.
Oh, not the word.
[Paul] If it's not proved enough
and then it's overbaked,
and you end up with a stodge.
Not your best, Antony.
-It's not my best.
-[Paul] Thank you, Antony.
Cheers, guys. Thank you so much.
Still smiling.
Still smiling.

*Terry*
[Paul] The decoration's amazing.
It's almost you concentrated on that
and lost the bread.
All the work that you did you can't see.
And actually parts of the bread's
been ripped off.
[Prue] Did it get stuck on the tin?
It did yes. Yeah.
The whole thing
is not baked. It's massively under proved.
Oh.
But my goodness, the flavour is lovely.
It's very citrusy and sweet. Delicious.
[Paul] How long was the first prove?
-Thirty minutes.
-And the second one?
Fifteen.
Fifteen? And then you baked it?
Yeah.
That's where your problem is.
It should have been at least two hours.
The idea's sound enough but unfortunately
not very well executed.
That's fair play.

*Manon*
Well, I love the Fabergé egg on the top,
and this lattice is lovely.
And I hope it tastes as good as it looks.
[Paul] You've managed
to utilise the dead dough
together with the bread
and it works as a package.
So well done.
Right, let's have a look.
The orange flower water is too strong.
It's like bath bubbles.
Oh, no.
Do you know what? You're lacking salt.
And I think it's effected the texture
of the loaf as well.
The design is impeccable
but I think everything inside is wrong.
-That's okay. Thank you.
-Thank you.

*Briony*
-The slightly Leaning Tower of Pisa.
-[Briony] It is. Yeah.
It looks very basic.
But you know what?
I love the way you've embedded
the towers in the dough.
Thank you.
[Noel] Aw!
Bye, Prince.
He's dead now.
Yeah, happy ending for Rapunzel.
I think for a celebration korovai,
it really needs more flavour
or fruit or something.
-[Paul] It's definitely underproved.
-Okay.
It's so tight. You needed
about another half hour, maybe longer.
[exhales]
[Noel] That was quite a tricky
showstopper, wasn't it?
[Paul] A lot of them were underbaked
and underproved,
which is sad,
because five hours is a long time.
But I think there's a couple of people
in line for Star Baker.
-I think Dan.
-[Sandi] He's our steady man, isn't he?
-He is.
-And Rahul.
-Rahul.
-Who thinks he can't do anything
but he's a really, really good baker.
I've never met anyone like Rahul.
-No.
-He's like an enigma.
[Sandi] Well, Jon certainly did not have
a good showstopper.
Strange was he did so well
with the Technical, he came second.
I mean likewise,
when you're looking at Terry,
who won the Technical,
he was doing quite well
and his Showstopper was terrible.
I cannot stop thinking
about the flavours of Ruby's.
Yet again, it seems to me,
she's saved herself.
She was in serious trouble
coming into today
but to smash it out the park again
with that showstopper.
You said perfection.
I know.
But unfortunately,
it leaves a couple of people
who really let themselves down today.
One was Briony. Overall, I think Briony
struggled over the three challenges.
Certainly, Antony. Flavours didn't work.
Texture wasn't good.
-The zip line was good.
-Yes.
The zip line was good.
Yeah, I think there's not enough
with the bread really.
-No?
-No.
Well, bakers,
what a bread fuelled weekend.
Well done for surviving.
I've got the great job of announcing
this week's Star Baker.
It's someone that the judges' thought
was fantastic throughout.
And someone who showed a lot of swagger
in the showstopper.
The Star Baker this week is...
Rahul.
[cheering]
-Well done.
-I'm gonna kill him.
So, that means I get the horrible job.
I'm afraid we do have to say goodbye
to somebody and that person is...
Come on. Just say it.
Antony.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, sorry, sweetheart.
[Antony] Too soon. Leaving too soon
but I don't think I'll stop smiling
'cause you know what?
This is for me,
the best opportunity ever.
-Come on, ladies. Come on.
-Come on, bring it in.
[Antony] I've met
some of the most amazing people,
so I'm smiling 'cause, you know what,
this isn't sad. [chuckles]
These are just happy tears
I'm leaving but still happy tears.
Yeah. Ah, God.
-Goodbye. Good luck.
-Thank you so much.
[Paul] It's very sad
'cause he's a good baker
and I'm sure he'll carry on baking
but unfortunately you can't afford
to have a bad week
and Antony had to go.
Yes, Rahul. Two weeks in a row, man.
It is so surreal.
I mean, I still can't believe it.
I just keep pinching myself. "Is it real?"
Now I think I can bake.
[Prue] When he put his showstopper down,
it really was a showstopper.
It took your breath away.
And it's his birthday on Monday.
-Is it?
-Yes.
There's another birthday present
for you then.
[Rahul] Yeah, thank you.
Rahul is getting stronger and stronger.
When you look at the showstopper,
it was baked beautifully
and the flavours were all there, too.
He ticked every single box.
-We've never had this before...
-[Sandi] Smiling.
...where someone saves themself twice now
in their Showstopper.
I'm like the cat with nine lives.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I need to get my act together
next week. [laughs]
I cannot deal with that stress again.
