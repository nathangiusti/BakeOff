*Crystelle*
-[Paul] Looks great.
-Those little egg shapes are lovely.
So, I've got a coconut streusel base,
a lime curd, and then fresh Kiwis.
[Prue] Delicious.
Really strong lime
which goes beautifully with the meringue.
The sides are too thick.
You've got, like, an impenetrable wall
you've gotta get through.
-But flavours are great though.
-[sighs] I'll take that.

*Jurgen*
We have the pyramids in matza.
-So, just the basic pavlova, then.
-[Jürgen] Just the basic pavlova.
[Paul] The idea is very good.
It's a little untidy. It's cracked a bit.
[Prue] That is so unusual.
You get the dates first
and then the orange.
It's a great blend of flavours,
and it works in that pavlova.
I would have thought it wouldn't have
enough acidity, but it does.
Jürgen's back.
-Thank you.
-[Prue laughs]
Mazel tov.
[laughing] Thank you.

*Lizzie*
[Paul] I mean, it's not the most
attractive looking pavlova.
-'Cause that green is… [laughs]
-[Prue] It looks…
[Lizzie] It is blueberry, rosemary,
and lemon curd.
It's like something
out of a Willy Wonka Factory.
[Matt] Yeah.
I like the rosemary. Very good lemon curd.
The flavours are spot-on.
I just think it's a bit stodgy.

*Amanda*
Love the appearance.
Has cracked a little bit.
I would have put more raspberry,
less chocolate.
-[Prue] The chocolate is so dominant.
-Okay.

*George*
-[Prue] George, I think it looks awful.
-Okay.
[Paul] The baking hasn't worked either.
That idea of putting it in the proving
drawer to get that sort of crack in there.
It's all marshmallow, isn't it?
You need to hollow it out more.
-The flavours are great.
-[George] Okay.
-The speculoos with the lemon.
-Absolutely delicious.
It's not all bad news. Thank you.

*Maggie*
-I think "informal" is a good word to use.
-Exactly.
[Prue] Higgledy-piggledy.
[Paul] Structurally, it's lost its way.
-It's collapsed a little bit on the side.
-[Maggie] Yes.
The flavours are lovely.
I think it does look a bit of a mess.

*Giuseppe
It looks really summery and delicious.
[Paul] I think you could've baked it
a little bit longer.
-Because of that.
-[Giuseppe] Yes.
[Paul] It's broken away.
Mmm. Flavours are so fresh and summery.
The peachy cream is just delicious.
-Yeah. Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done.

*Freya*
-[Prue] Looks fantastic.
-Decoration looks very good.
-But…
-Oh, gosh.
The proof is literally in the pudding.
[Paul] Wow, it's like an Eton mess.
The aquafaba doesn't hold up well at all.
[Paul] They're not very strong flavours.
-They're not tangy or tart enough.
-[Freya] Okay.
If you get a slice
of the candied peach, it's good.
But the, sort of, sloppy bit
in the middle, that's not very nice.

*Chigs*
-[Paul] That looks amazing.
-[Prue] I love the edge.
Just so casually, but elegantly swirled.
Beautiful. All right, let's have a look.
That just falls through.
-Are you excited?
-I am.
-That's for you.
-[Prue] Oh, look at that.
It's filled with Chantilly cream
and a mango and passion fruit coulis.
[Prue] It's lovely, soft,
but stable in the middle.
And crunchy outside.
I think it's wonderful.
The acidity and the cream is just lovely.
[Paul] There's a nice marshmallow
in there, its stable enough to hold it.
It's quite difficult to get that balance.
But the way you've done the top
and the chocolate, I can't, you know…

*Jurgen*
Jürgen, would you like to bring
your Showstopper up, please?
Well, I think it looks absolutely amazing.
[Paul] The wine jelly.
You've got a few little bubbles in there.
But I like the way it's set.
That view looks lovely.
That cut through beautifully.
-Wow.
-[Jürgen] It's topped by wine jelly.
Then white chocolate Bavarian
with black pepper.
Then a genoise and then at the bottom
there's a hazelnut dacquoise.
That is such a luxurious, creamy,
boozy mouthful.
Your textures of everything are gorgeous.
-I can't get the black pepper.
-No, I'm looking for the pepper.
Usually it comes a bit later.
-Okay, let's just wait for a minute.
-[all chuckling]
[Paul] If you'd like to sing.
[humming "Pastime With Good Company"]
-[clapping]
-That's very familiar.
-Got the pepper.
-[Jürgen] Got the pepper?
[all laughing]
Excellent.

*Amanda*
This is inspired
by a crime scene that I went to.
[all laughing]
When I was very young in service.
So I think you struggled with the joconde.
And the dam has broken
when it was still trying to set.
[Amanda] It's genoise sponge
with Calvados Bavarian cream,
with caramelised apple jelly.
And the top is a maple syrup glaze.
They look like very beautiful layers. Mmm.
You know, it tastes absolutely delicious,
but it does not taste a lot of apple.
You're getting more
of an alcoholic flavour.
The texture of everything is great.
But unfortunately you drowned
everything out with that Calvados.

*Giuseppe*
You've lost some of the definition,
but it's pretty.
I think overall,
it's quite a professional-looking piece.
Very, very elegant.
The filling is two types of bavarois,
pistachio and raspberry and strawberry.
[Paul] Mmm, great layers.
Oh, look at that, soft as anything.
-Beautiful.
-Oh.
Great flavours. Great acidity.
The genoise has been baked beautifully.
It's lovely and soft.
I mean, you'd serve that
at a decent hotel.
-How many stars?
-Oh, a good five.
-[Prue] Excellent.
-Thank you very much.

*Lizzie*
The bin's for you.
-"I'm wheelie born in Liverpool."
-[Paul] Oh, right, yeah.
-[all laughing]
-I love it.
You got the Liverpool skyline,
which is pretty cool.
It's a bit rudimentary.
[chuckling] Dacquoise is
a little bit tough.
[Prue] It's hard work, Lizzie.
[Paul] I think your texture's all wrong,
but your flavours are beautiful.
-It's wheelie good.
-There you go.
[all laughing]

*Crystelle*
[Paul] Well, I think it looks beautiful.
The pipework is particularly good.
Simple, but effective. [clicks tongue]
[Prue] Those layers are really lovely.
They're very powerful flavours.
The coconut and lime
is just beautiful. Mmm.
The lime, it's so powerful.
I would've pulled that back a little bit.
But everything else I'm happy with.
Thank you.

*George*
[Prue] I like the flower patterns.
But where the joins are,
it's a bit clumsy. It's sort of lopsided.
-Well, what am I--
-The peanut layer.
Oh, literally you've got
a layer of peanuts.
[crunching]
You certainly get the peanut flavour
and the peanut crunch.
[Paul] That peanut layer is ridiculous.
Can't get through it.
I think you've just gone overkill
with the peanuts.
-I quite like peanuts.
-[all laughing]

*Chigs*
[Paul] It looks amazing.
The joconde's well done.
-I mean, this was taken from a tile.
-[Chigs chuckles] Yeah.
And it's so original
and it looks startling.
-Thank you.
-[Paul] And two tiers.
Looks like a delicious bathroom.
[chuckles]
The bavarois are perfection.
They are perfection.
Your flavours
and your textures are superb.
They're just firm enough to stay up.
I mean, it's really clever.
I don't even like Black Forest gateau
and I love that.
Thank you.

*Freya*
[Prue] You've lost some of the imprime.
It's a bit messy,
but let's have a look inside, shall we?
[Freya] The joconde is chocolate hazelnut.
Then there's a hazelnut dacquoise
and then a layer
of Italian meringue buttercream,
then a chocolate orange mousse
and then on top, it's orange jelly.
[Paul] It's set quite hard.
It's more like a ganache.
-Yeah, yeah.
-[Paul] The mousse.
-I think the orange is too strong.
-[Paul] So strong.
[Prue] But I actually think
your joconde is really good.
Thank you.
It needed a cream, it needed something
in there to hold everything together.
I've had some beautiful vegan cakes.
It's not one of the better ones.

*Maggie*
See the Dam Busters have been in.
[laughing]
Let's have a look at it.
[Prue] Well, it's a very pretty colour.
Mmm.
Maggie, the flavour is lovely.
It's the essence of summer.
The strawberries are just beautiful.
[Paul] Where's your second
element in this?
The bavarois and the coulis.
[Paul] Ah, that's the second element.
What have you been doing
for four and a half hours?
-Doing it twice.
-[Paul] Ah, did you do it twice?
-Flavours are lovely.
-[Prue] And the joconde is good.
-Thank you so much.
-[Paul] Thank you.



Well, that Showstopper
ran the gamut, didn't it?
[Paul] Giuseppe, Jürgen, Chigs.
I think they've all done
quite well out of this.
-Jürgen's was an amazing concept.
-I think Jürgen's was beautiful.
But if you have another look
at Chigs', it's still holding well.
All the layers were there.
The taste was delicious.
-Fantastic flavour.
-[Paul] Some of them did collapse.
There was a couple of people that messed
up a bit with textures and flavours.
You look at Maggie, she classed the puree
on top as a second element.
That's not the case.
-You're not buying it.
-[Paul] I'm not buying it.
It split as well.
I mean, it poured out all over the place.
But also
I was really disappointed in Freya.
Because although she did better
with the dacquoise in this,
it was far too thick.
[Paul] That was very dry.
But then you look at Amanda's,
the Calvados in that bavarois
was the only thing you could taste.
-And it split.
-But it tasted nice.
You gotta look back
on the two challenges as well.
We'll have another cup of tea
and another slice of cake,
-and then we'll make a decision.
-Slice of cake.
[mimics Worzel Gummidge] Cup of tea
and a slice of cake, Aunt Sally.
Well, bakers,
thank you for another great week.
It falls to me to announce
who the Star Baker is.
And that person is…
Chigs.
-[Matt] Congratulations!
-[cheering]
Okay, bakers, that means
that I've got the horrible job this week
of announcing the person who's leaving us,
and we're really gonna miss them.
The person who's leaving us this week is…
Maggie.
It's been such good fun.
[chuckling] It's been such…
[Prue] Maggie, honestly,
you've done so well.
[Maggie] The whole thing
has been such fun, really.
And just to have been part of it
is just a complete joy.
[Matt] We're going to miss you so much.
To have stayed for four weeks.
I think it comes pretty high, really.
On a personal level,
nothing can beat delivering a baby.
And bringing a new life into the world.
But it comes quite second.
Just having a bad week.
-You'll have a good week next week.
-Thank you, I will.
Ah, God. Nightmare. [laughs]
I feel like
I definitely scraped through that.
Glad to be here,
but I'm really sad to see Maggie go.
-[Paul] Well done, Chigs.
-Thank you very much, Paul.
[sighs in relief]
[Chigs] What the hell just happened?
Thank you.
Get a handshake
and Star Baker in the same week.
[Crystelle] Oh, you bloody smashed it.
Can't believe it. I'm honestly…
I am so speechless right now.
It never happens. But I'm lost for words.
[Paul] I think Chigs
smashed it out the park.
I think all three challenges,
he was exceptionally good.
I mean, for a guy who said
he'd been baking up to 12 months ago,
he's done an amazing job.
I got Star Baker, Mum.
-[Chigs' mother] Am I on TV?
-Yeah!
[Chigs' mother laughing]
-Congratulations, I'm so proud of you!
-Thank you, Mum.
-So proud of you. I love you.
-Thank you. I love you too!
