-Hello, Kate.
-Hiya.
[Paul] I do like this pattern on the top.
It's quite delicate,
but it makes it look quite pretty as well.
[Prue] It's just that they have run
over the edge a bit.
[Paul] I think the biscuit's beautiful
and soft, but it holds its shape.
I think you've got the texture spot on,
actually, and I do like the flavours.
Get a slight aromatic flavour
from the caramel.
-That aromatic thing is actually the bay.
-[Paul] Yeah.
I really like it.

*James*
There's a huge difference between
the shortbread in these two.
-It's quite doughy.
-Hmm.
The flavours are sort of there.
The textures aren't, though.
-Yep.
-[Paul] I think your issue is the base.
-Hasn't got the texture of a shortbread.
-Yeah.
Maybe it's got too much pecan.
It's a little unpleasant.

*Julia*
[Paul] I do like the design on top.
I mean you're got some lips there.
-[Julia] Yeah.
-I'd like to see that nice and flat.
The caramel is bulging out on all of them,
which makes them equal.
I love the shortbread. Very nutty.
Gives it a nice edge, a nice little bit
of crunch to the softness.
-The caramel is a little too salty.
-Okay.

*Yan*
[Paul] I like the picture of Prue
on the top.
[chuckles]
I like the flavours.
It's more toffee-like than caramel.
I don't think
the texture of anything is right.
The nutty biscuit is quite coarse
and the chocolate is thick.
That's disappointing.

*Sophie*
Obviously they're not identical.
You've had a bit of an issue
with time as well.
[Prue] But I can see
it was going to be really interesting.
You had the disc on top of the ganache
on top of the caramel
on top of the biscuit.
-[Prue] It's a four layered job.
-Yes, which probably didn't help matters.
[Prue] Very orangey.
The base is a bit dry. However the taste
the soft silky caramel
with the orange as well, together, works.
It is delicious. It is very, very good.
They look hideous.
[laughing]
[Paul] But they taste amazing.

*Steven*
They are supposed to be identical
and they look pretty identical.
You can see the layers.
My issue is the thickness of that biscuit.
-Yeah.
-The overall size of it.
Oh, it drops through very well though.
[Prue] Look at that.
For the first time
I don't like the flavours.
And I don't like the texture
of that caramel. It's far too bitter.
I know, but I'll tell you what, Steven,
I mean, for me, I love that caramel.
I love the bitterness of it. I don't like
really, really sweet things.
And the slight bitterness,
the orangey-ness, the macadamia,
everything mitigates the caramel.

*Stacey*
They are so pretty and they are identical.
[Paul] They are very neat.
Very sharp from the side as well.
The flavours are pretty strong. The rum
comes through very strongly, the chilli.
It's a grown up taste.
But I don't really like the rum flavour.
The biggest issue I have is the depth
of that chocolate. It's too thick.

*Tom*
It looks to me as if you've had
a little time problem?
I decided to leave them in the tins
because I didn't want to have
eighteen splodgy messes.
[Prue] Lovely cracky top.
The flavour is great.
The caramel is not the right texture
because it's too soft
and you didn't finish it.

*Liam*
What's all this?
So you know Tetris?
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.
So I don't know why, but I really wanted
to make a Tetris themed shortbread look.
[laughing]
Love the chocolate on top
because it's nice and neat and flat.
The simplicity of it works.
You've got a few issues
with the caramel pouring out the side.
The proportions 2 to 1. I like that.
Sick.
-Can you really eat that much caramel?
-Yeah.
[laughing]
[Paul] The peanut butter in there
is very clever. It's set beautifully.
It's crunchy enough, but again,
soft enough.
You've got that nice balance between
the two. But I love that flavour.
[clapping]
That is crazy. Oh my God.
-Good job.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done, Liam.
-[Paul] Thanks buddy.

Sophie, would you like to bring up
your caramel cake?
[Paul] Very, very elegant.
Thank you.
Obviously humidity
has attacked the caramel
because the nest was much bigger.
[Prue] But beautiful mirror glaze.
[Paul] Hazelnut chocolate.
-What's not to like?
-Yeah.
The light buttercream you've got
in there as well is delicious, like silk.
Delicious. I'm very impressed
with the eggs.
They've got salted
caramel inside, have they?
[Sophie] Yes, they have. Yep.
[laughing]
[Prue] How can you eat
that much caramel, Paul?
[Paul] It's a skill. That is magnificent.
Thank you.

*James*
It's a little bit on the simplistic side.
You have spent so much time
on all the extras
and they're not really part of the cake.
Flavour's lovely. Real caramel taste.
I like the brittle.
You can feel it in your teeth.
It tastes likes you've over-mixed
the sponge because it's a bit rubbery.

*Liam*
I think it looks really appetising.
I love this drip effect as well.
It works you know.
Great colour on that cake.
[Prue] What's so good is the contrast
of the buttercream and the cake.
Gingery, treacly, lovely.
The bake is good. The textures good.
I think you should be very proud
of yourself with that cake.

*Stacey*
I love the colours, I love
the butterflies, its just wonderful.
The cake however, the icing on the cake
more specifically is too thin.
It's just run off.
It looks slightly slimy
rather than luscious.
Delicious chocolate cake.
Texture's perfect.
It's got a delicate flavour in there
and it's baked well.
My big issue is the finish.

*Julia*
The shards are nicely done. They are nice
and thin and I bet they are crackly.
But on the walnuts I think
your caramel was a bit too thick.
I actually love the taste of the cake,
I think it's beautiful.
Um, the poppy seed really works in it.
I think you've created
quite an elegant cake.
You've ticked all the boxes. Well done.
Thank you so much.

*Yan*
I think that is fantastic.
The spun sugar, the cinder toffee,
the caramel river. Ingenious. Yeah.
Very original.
So we've got an animal print
in the middle of our cake?
-[Paul] Wow.
-[Prue] It's very clever.
[Prue] The sponge is a little bit tough.
Love the flavours. That blend between
the chocolate and the orange
works really well.
It is slightly overbaked.

*Steven*
[Paul] It looks like something out
of Game of Thrones. It is very clever.
The mirror glaze is absolutely
extraordinary. It's so shiny.
The, um... Okay.
[Prue] How do you get in there? Crunch.
Oh, look at that.
Your cake is far too stodgy.
[Prue] It's too solid.
Overall, a bit disappointed.
I think the look's great,
but the inside has the issue.

*Tom*
[Paul] You've got the spun sugar
as the nest
and you've got a bit of nut brittle
on the side. It's quite basic isn't it?
Because this is a caramel cake
the centrepiece should be caramel,
although they're very pretty, the flowers,
I think they've not done you a service.
[Paul] Okay.
Oh, Tom! It is gluey, it's underbaked,
it's got no crumb.
[Paul] How did you manage with those
beautiful ingredients to create that?
-Did you make it at home?
-Yes, but as muffins.
So I think because they are smaller
they cook better.
In hindsight, as a cake,
probably not the right recipe to use.
-[Prue] The butter icing is nice.
-[chuckles]
-That's something.
-[Prue] It's got passionfruit
and I'm glad to say that you left
the pips in, which I love.
I like the crunch.

*Kate*
There are so many colours in there
and they are really clear and bright.
[Paul] I love the toffee apples.
They look great.
I just can't wait to try this, actually.
-[Prue] Wow.
-[Paul] Wow.
Wonderful apple flavour.
Really good and light.
Wow, that's beautiful.
The apple, I've just had a big piece
of apple with the cake. That's delicious.
And actually, the cream cheese frosting
when you eat it together again,
another level.
But the apple is masterful in there.
And the cake is sensational.
-[Paul] Very well done.
-[Prue] Well done. Very well done.
-Thank you very much.
-[Paul] Thank you.


What did you think of
their mad caramel skills?
I was really impressed with
the imagination of what they did.
[Paul] Kate did very well.
Do you know, I think
that was the best tasting cake.
I asked her for the recipe because
I have got to know how to make that cake.
And Liam stayed up there, didn't he?
[Paul] He did. Again beautifully spiced
and with that hint of ginger
that sits on your tongue at the end.
It was very, very good.
When you're looking at the people
that are in a little bit of trouble,
I'd say Tom. That, unfortunately,
was not a good cake.
-I felt for him though because...
-I felt for him, too.
He knew he had an off day.
James' cake was dry.
He went caramel on everything,
but the problem was he didn't put
the caramel parts on the cake.
It's like we're having
a bag of sweets with your cake.
Well, we don't envy you having to decide.
But what Noel and I both want to know
is how sick you're feeling. Paul?
Oh, dear. The amount of sugar.
I crave a bag of crisps.
[Sandi] Oh, good. Something healthy
to get yourself back on track.
Yes.
Well done, bakers,
on your caramel crusade.
Now, this week, I've got the great job
of announcing Star Baker.
And the Star Baker this week
made some pretty fine shortbread,
but in the showstopper
produced a cake so banging
that the judges wanted the recipe.
Set off the sugar fireworks
because this week's Star Baker is...
Kate.
Are you joking me?
[all applauding]
Well done.
[Noel] Well done. Well done.
So that means I get to do the next bit,
which I absolutely hate,
but I'm afraid
somebody has to leave the tent.
And the person we're saying
goodbye to today is...
Tom.
I'm so sorry.
Justified. [chuckles]
It was a bad cake.
-[Sandi] I'm so sorry.
-[Tom] It was a terrible cake.
-[Paul] Unlucky, buddy.
-[Tom] No, no it's fine.
Disappointed to be leaving,
but I did a really bad cake
and everyone else did excellent cakes
and I think it's totally fair.
Going to miss you.
Poor Tom, because he really did make
a mess of it.
That cake was raw.
It was just an off day for him.
You were a little bit lucky.
Yes, I know. Don't I know it.
Scraped through again. I need a beer.
[laughs]
I'm sad for Liam because he thought
he was going to get Star Baker.
Oh, my days.
-[Prue] You want to stay up there.
-Yes.
[Prue] Because you really are flying.
So close.
Didn't expect that at all.
I'll be walking round all week,
like, massive smile.
-That cake was fantastic. It really was.
-Thank you.
Kate's apple cake today was, I think,
the best cake I have ever eaten.
In my life.
[Kate] Hi, Ma, you okay? Guess what?
I got Star Baker this week.
[cheerful shouting on phone]
[laughing]
