*Lizzie*
-Hello, Lizzie.
-Hello!
Hey, Lizzie.
This is "My Tart Will Go On."
Erm, like Titanic,
it was a disaster movie.
The cream melted.
-[laughs]
-[Prue] It does look rough and ready.
It's the piping that you've lost.
Probably with the heat from underneath it.
-That's one crispy base.
-[cracking]
Mmm.
Well, you might not
have managed the finesse.
Flavour is delicious.
And it's definitely a caramel tart.
I think if you could have just had time
to finish it properly,
you'd have a little triumph here.
Thanks for the lifeboat anyway.
I'll throw a life jacket as well.
The caramel
is absolutely delicious with that base.
It's a shame it looks like that.
Still, I love it. Finesse, it's not.

*Crystelle*
I like the look of it.
The pipework's good.
And the sides look neat.
Good colour as well.
-So far, so good.
-[sighs] Good God.
[Prue] Mmm.
Quite treacly. The caramel.
So, it's slightly bitter.
But having said that,
because you've got the apple
and the nuts and the cream,
it balances it out.
-[Prue] I think it's lovely.
-[Paul] Good job.

*Chigs*
-Looks lovely.
-It's very neat.
[Paul] Yeah,
it's good decoration on top of that.
[Prue] Thank you.
-Chigs, it's too strong for me.
-[Paul] Yeah.
Too heavy on the chocolate,
almost too much caramel.
-I know it's a caramel tart.
-[Chigs] Right.
-The caramel is too dark.
-[Chigs] Okay.
The ginger is coming through,
it's delicate,
the pastry's a little bit thick.
I think you've taken
the caramel a little too far.
Oh, fair enough.

*Giuseppe*
[Paul] It's beautiful, very thin.
And I love the hazelnuts.
[Prue] That pastry is so crisp.
The caramel is a little liquid.
Funnily enough, though it's quite liquid,
the textures are wonderful.
-I think it's overall a little too sweet.
-Right.
We wanted caramel to be the hero flavour.
It's not. It's the hazelnut.
Okay.

*Jurgen*
There have been issues with cooling.
It's a pity, because we did ask
for a beautifully decorated tart.
Obviously, the first thing
you see about that is the split.
[Paul chuckles]
It's gonna rip
every tooth that was in my head.
What you made is nut toffee.
-It's too chewy.
-[Prue] Not your best, Jürgen.
-Great flavour.
-Thank you.
But not quite what we asked for.

*George*
Looks like global warming in the Arctic.
-[George] Cooling time didn't work out.
-[Prue chuckles]
That is very nice thin crust.
Custard looks
as if it's just curdled a little bit.
[Paul] The custard's definitely curdled,
and that caramel,
'cause it's on the warm custard,
it just remains liquid.
Not getting a huge amount of flavour,
which is annoying.
The glory of caramel custard
is the smoothness.
Once you curdle it, you've lost
the thing that it's famous for.
-I like the base.
-It's all about the base.
[Prue chuckles]
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thanks very much.
-I like it all. And I like you.
-Thanks, that means a lot.

*Crystelle*
Crystelle, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?
What happened to the bowl?
It was a bit of
a last-minute rush at the end.
I ended up going with the balloon method
so I did it while it was quite warm.
It was gonna be bigger.
I like the look of the chocolate.
You got a lovely glaze on that chocolate.
-That looks lovely.
-[Prue] That's very beautiful.
I love the flavour.
-Sort of salted caramel chew.
-The biscuit layer is okay.
The chocolate layer on the top's
just too thick.
And your mousse is quite dry.
A mousse should be
like bubbles on the mouth.
-It's quite stodgy. Gelatin?
-Yeah.
-[Paul] Too much.
-It's a bit too much. Look, it's gluey.
So overall, I quite like the flavour,
even though it is rich.
You couldn't eat a lot of that,
but it looks lovely.
Thank you. I'll take that.

*Jurgen*
Jürgen, I think it looks
most spectacular.
I love the sponge fingers.
The isomalt looks really thick.
You've got quite a heavy collar here,
but the dome itself looks beautiful
'cause it's absolutely crystal-clear.
-Love the flower in the front.
-[Prue] Looks really good.
[Noel] Oh!
Oh, you are a piece of work.
-[Paul] Cut into it.
-[Matt] Oh, look at that.
[Prue] Gosh, that looks beautiful.
-Wow.
-[Matt] Wow!
[Prue] That looks so lovely
because the bavarois
are the same thickness.
The caramel at the bottom
and the pastry is really thin.
That's delicious.
Absolutely. Every layer
from the shortbread to the bavarois,
all the way to the top.
The passion fruit.
The praline, the lady's fingers.
The whole thing's beautiful.
-It's nice to have you back in the tent.
-Thank you very much.
-Jürgen, it's an absolute triumph.
-Thank you.
-Can't resist another.
-[Paul] Well done, thank you very much.

*Giuseppe*
-Lovely shaped dome. Very misty.
-Yeah.
[Paul] Looks like
a greenhouse in the winter.
[laughing]
Apart from that,
it's very elegant and neat.
[Noel] Oh, come on.
[all exclaiming]
-There's so much caramel.
-[Prue] Certainly tastes of caramel.
Actually, it's not too much.
Something's slightly wrong
about the textures.
The glueiness of the glaze
is a little unpleasant.
[Paul] Your mousse is all wrong,
it's like a wallpaper paste.
And it's heavy and stodgy and dry.
The glaze is too gluey.
-Put gelatin in there?
-I did. Yes.
[Paul] Probably a bit too much.
However, it does taste lovely.

*Chigs*
-Looks a mess, doesn't it?
-[Chigs] Yeah.
[Paul] You've had a bit of leakage
and nothing's set.
-Doesn't look the right colour.
-[Chigs] No.
[Paul] It's too light.
The isomalt's too misty.
It's a shame 'cause you can't see
the chocolate work inside.
Let's take it off.
-I mean, that looks a lot better already.
-[all chuckle]
-[Paul] Ooh, look at that.
-[Prue] Thank you.
I love the even layers. Really nice.
The caramel wasn't taken
as far as it could've been,
which is why it's poured out.
Your dacquoise is nice.
It works with the coffee flavour.
I think the flavour
is absolutely delicious, Chigs.
Definite caramel, chocolate is just there.
The praline is delicious.
It's just all a bit liquid.
It's such a pity
'cause it's so nearly perfect.
-Yeah.
-Thank you, Chigs.
[Chigs] Cheers, guys, thank you.

*George*
Well, straight off the cuff
it looks amazing.
I like what you've done with that dome,
considering it's made from sugar.
That's difficult.
It's a nice-looking cake.
-George, I think it's beautiful.
-Thank you.
[Paul] This is gonna be
difficult in sugar.
-Oh, perfect.
-[Prue] Perfect.
Boom.
-[groans]
-[Prue chuckles]
-[Matt] Wow!
-[Noel] Mmm-hmm.
-I could eat a lot of that, George.
-[sighs]
It's a little too dry for me.
You've got dry chocolate ganache,
dry dacquoise,
then you got a little thin layer
of buttercream,
and then you have dacquoise again.
It needed a mousse or a bavarois
rather than just buttercream.
The taste is nice, but the textures,
for me, are too dry on the mouth.
[Prue] I know what you mean,
but I actually think that if you get
a mouthful of everything, it's delicious.
And I think you've done a really good job.
-Thank you very much, George.
-Thank you.

*Lizzie*
Well, it looks amazing.
As always with your bakes,
it's surprising and witty.
-I like it.
-We asked for finesse.
I think we've got it.
You've done an upside down dome,
which is unusual and brave.
Let's have a look, shall we?
[sighs] How am I gonna do this?
-I think I'm gonna need a spoon.
-[laughs]
I have never had sage caramel before.
-What do you think?
-The flavour's very strong.
To be very honest, Lizzie,
it doesn't look great inside there.
-It's a bit rough and ready.
-[Paul] It's just like a trifle.
You've got literally just a mess
of everything going on.
You've mashed it with the flowers.
[Prue] Funnily enough,
Paul says it's like a trifle.
It would be better
if it had a ton of custard in it,
because it's quite stodgy.
The roses are not great to eat,
and it's very sweet.
I've never had anything like it before.
-[Prue] I think it's very brave.
-Yeah, very brave.
-Thanks, Lizzie.




Well, I think that the bakers will be glad
to see the back of caramel week.
-It's been really good in parts.
-Nice to see Jürgen come back.
I think the one that deserves a little pat
on the back was George for using sugar.
[Matt] He could've come in today
and said, "I'm beaten,"
but he came in
and really did himself proud.
Is it enough to save him?
And Lizzie, I have to say,
has not done herself proud.
The whole thing was sort of inedible.
Does this mean Lizzie
is near the bottom now?
It's her or George isn't it?
George has been struggling over the first
two challenges. He's built himself up.
And Lizzie's sort of dropped down.
Don't think he's on his own anymore.
I was a little bit upset
about Giuseppe's as well.
That was really gelatinous.
He's still got a good chance
of being Star Baker
'cause he did do so well
in the other two.
I think Crystelle is in line
for Star Baker
'cause she had not had a bad week.
Jürgen's had a pretty good week.
He did come second in the Technical,
and I think he's done really well today.
[Matt] So let's talk about Chigs.
I thought he did very well
in his Chignature.
Chigs got better every challenge
from Signature through to Showstopper.
At the end of the day,
I think you've got two people in trouble
and the other four in line for Star Baker.
Well done, bakers.
That was a tricky week. Caramel.
And I've got the amazing job of announcing
who is Star Baker this week.
And the person
who's Star Baker this week is…
Jürgen.
[all clapping]
You're back, Jürgy-pops,
you're back.
-Jürgy-Popsy back.
-[all laugh]
And I have the unenviable task
of telling you who's going home
and what I will say is that
it was really close this week.
Could have been one of two people.
The person who's going is someone
we've all grown very close to
and we're all gonna miss a lot.
I'm afraid that the person
going home this week is…
George.
-[Crystelle murmurs]
-It's all right, guys.
There is bittersweet to it.
My Showstopper, I was proud of.
-[Paul] I just think you ran out of steam.
-Yeah, I know.
It is very sad to see George go.
But, unfortunately, George
made more mistakes than Lizzie did.
Speaking to my family,
they're just so proud
that I've managed to kind of
even get in the tent.
So, yeah, week seven. I'm fine with that.
Well done, Jürgen. Well done.
I thought actually Jürgen did enough
to win Star Baker today.
[Prue] Jürgen was back
to his old self, wasn't he?
It was honestly one of the best desserts
I've ever tasted and I want the recipe.
-[Lizzie] How many is that now?
-[Crystelle] How many Star Bakers?
-[Jürgen] Three Star Bakers.
-[Crystelle] Good God!
-[woman] Hello darling. How are you?
-Hello.
Yes, Star Baker again.
-No way!
-[Jürgen] Yes.
-Oh, amazing.
-Yeah.
[Crystelle] Caramel!
We've got five of the strongest
bakers this year going through.
Quarter final? What the hell?
Yeah, it does feel all of a sudden
like we are in a serious competition now.
[Paul] Going into next week
is going to be a little bit different
and, I think, very difficult.
