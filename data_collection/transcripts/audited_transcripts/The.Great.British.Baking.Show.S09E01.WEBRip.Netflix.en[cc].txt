*Maggie*
-[Prue] Still smiling, I see.
-[Maggie] One has to.
I wanted them all
to have a little angel on top,
but I'm afraid I must admit
to having the shakes.
They kept losing their wings.
[Prue] Well, one of them's got it.
The chocolate
is a little bit rough and ready.
[Paul] You got a nice little swirl
in there, actually.
-[Prue] I think your sponge is excellent.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Texture of it is lovely.
-Great flavour.
You couldn't eat a lot of it
because it is so rich.
-The cocoa content's quite high.
-Yes.
My husband would find this
far too much chocolate.
He'd like a milk chocolate.
-For heaven's sake.
-He likes adulterated chocolate.
This is pure.
-This is chocolate.
-[Prue] Dark.

*Jaireno*
There's a sort of fold in there,
not a swirl.
The bitterness from the sugar is perfect,
and the passion fruit
is absolutely delicious.
It is so worth the calories.

*Amanda*
They are a bit uneven.
-I think they're a little bit drunk.
-[Prue] I don't think that's a swirl.
-[Amanda] No.
-[Prue] It's a blob.
[Paul] Cherry's not strong enough
'cause it's blended so much
with the little bit of coffee in there.
Nice lot of booze though.
I like the booze.

*Tom*
Not much of a mini roll.
[Prue] You know, it's not at all bad
because you have got a bit of a swirl.
-And the texture of the cake is lovely.
-Thank you very much.
But you're not getting enough
of the cherry coming through.

*Crystelle*
Well, they're pretty neat.
I think they look attractive.
[Paul] Let's see how they look inside.
Don't wanna look.
[Paul] There's not much
of a swirl in there, is there?
There's like, an abstract swirl.
I think maybe the cream
kind of hides the swirl.
-I have to tell you, it's delicious.
-Oh!
[Paul] I think you've got
a great blend of the spices,
but more so the cardamom
and the coconut together
work beautifully well.
My only complaint
is there's a touch too much jaggery.
-[Crystelle] Okay.
-It's too sweet.
That's absolutely fine.
I'll take that. [chuckles]

*George*
Too hot, bad timing, rushing…
-Maybe a bit of panic as well.
-[Paul] Mmm.
It's pudding.
-It's not cake.
-It's still warm.
And the whole thing's collapsed
'cause you put
a massive amount of chocolate.
There's a famous saying in Cyprus,
which you'll probably be
more than aware of,
Siga, siga.
-Yeah.
-[Prue] What does that mean?
-Slowly, slowly.
-Yeah, slowly, slowly.

*Rochica*
[Prue] You've got a fairly good swirl.
I think the flavours are lovely.
It is a little stodgy.
Even with spelt in,
you've managed to overmix it.
-Oh, okay.
-It's too rubbery.

*Jurgen*
-There was a bit of a wind.
-Forest suffered a storm.
Black Forest is not entirely healthy.
[all laughing]
[Paul] A nice bit of a swirl in there.
You haven't over-sweetened the filling.
So you get that sour cherry.
-You're from the Black Forest?
-Yes.
Try some.
-What'd you think?
-I would buy it.
Why?
The balance between
cream and chocolate is right.
And you have enough sour cherry.
-And not sweet.
-[Prue] I agree.
-I agree entirely.
-[Jürgen] Thank you.
-[Paul] Just needs--
-Just judge your own cake.
I think it's very good.
-Well done.
-[Jürgen] Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done.

*Freya*
[Prue] I'm full of admiration for you
because on the few occasions
that I've tried to use aquafaba
instead of egg whites, takes ages.
Oh, yeah. It is a bit of a faff,
isn't it, really?
-[all chuckling]
-[Freya] I mean…
[Paul] Let's see if it is
worth it, shall we?
I like the nice tart flavour
of the raspberries.
And you've got a little hint
of lemon in there as well.
Cake is a little bit hefty.

*Chigs*
-[Paul] That's got a lovely swirl.
-Thank you.
I like that the sponge is a little thicker
because it means it's risen more.
And the fresh strawberries
are just delicious.

*Lizzie*
They're giraffe-patterned, giraffe-esque.
And we could even go as far to say,
the caramel drips evenly.
-The sea lion in a bit of water.
-[contestants laughing]
Not the best-looking mini rolls I've seen.
There was obviously a rush.
The cream and the caramel's run out
'cause it's been warm when you've done it,
and then your flavours are all wrong.
It's down to the timing.
I bet you did better
when you were practising.
Yeah, but… Tent pressure, isn't it?

*Giuseppe*
Goodness, Giuseppe.
That looks as neat as a pin.
Absolutely beautiful.
You've come up with something
that's very elegant.
Cuts lovely, classic, lovely swirl.
[Prue] That is a perfect swirl.
Classic almond cake with orange.
[Giuseppe] Yeah.
-It's my favourite kind of cake.
-Oh, good.
It's so delicate and it's so well-balanced
that it grows on you.
With every mouthful,
it's getting better and better.
I think your flavours are beautiful.
The orange blossom comes through,
and it's very delicate,
but it's enough there
to create great flavour
because ricotta carries
a little bit of flavour.
So between the two, it's perfect.
-[Prue] It's a triumph. Well done.
-Oh, God.
-Thank you, Giuseppe.
-Thank you.

*Chigs*
Chigs, would you like to
bring your cake up here?
-Matt, could you help me?
-[Matt] I'll give you a hand.
[Chigs chuckles]
-[Matt] Ready?
-[Chigs] Yeah.
-To me…
-[both] To you.
-To me…
-To you.
-[Matt] To me…
-[Chigs] To you.
Just cuppin' the cup.
-There you go.
-It's gonna break.
It's gonna break. I'm gonna step back now.
-Watch it…
-[all exclaim]
Well, it was antigravity before,
but I dunno what it is now. [laughs]
-When I say antigravity…
-It's not much anymore.
[Paul] But I like the bowl. It's got a bit
of movement in it, which I quite like.
-So it's chocolate fudge?
-Yes.
[Prue] The layers are good.
[Chigs] It's got a chocolate and peanut
butter buttercream around it as well.
[Prue] I think it's delicious.
I also like the texture.
Beautifully moist.
The sponge is delicious,
and so is the peanut butter
buttercream as well.
You're a very good baker.
Maybe your engineering skills
need honing a little.

*George*
-It could be neater.
-I agree.
[Prue] I'm sure you can paint better.
I can certainly paint
better than that. Absolutely.
[Paul] Let's have a look.
I think you've got some nice flavours,
but you need to concentrate
more on the finesse.
Yeah.

*Maggie*
I feel it looks more like a plant pot
than an ice cream.
It's gone from a cornet to a tub.
-Your Victoria sandwich is delicious.
-Thank you.
[Paul] But there's not
much flavour in there.
I was expecting something
very different to this.

*Jairzeno*
I was expecting something
very different to that.
It's quite, erm, mortifying, actually.
I think the sponge is perfect.
I love the flavour.
The taste of that guava, I love it.
All the elements are there,
but there's nothing else.

*Amanda*
[Prue] Love the little dolphins,
and I think it's beautifully done.
You've certainly got
the gravity-defying bit.
I'm not totally convinced it does,
because that's just
the Rice Krispies bit, isn't it?
-Yeah.
-[Paul] But I love the colour of it.
The concept of it.
This is lemon drizzle.
Yeah, lemon and elderflower.
I think your sponges
are slightly over-baked.
They're a little bit too dry.
Did you use an extract with that one?
I used, erm, elderflower liqueur.
There's quite a lot in there.
I think there's a touch too much.
-It's quite powerful.
-[Paul] It burns, doesn't it?
Thank you very much.

*Lizzie*
Lizzie, would you like to bring up
your showstopper, please?
-[Amanda gasps]
-[Tom] Oh, no!
-[Noel] Whoops.
-[Freya] Oh, my gosh.
[chuckles] God. Sorry.
[Noel] Paul slowly sabotaged you.
[all laugh]
It's a bit simplistic,
but it does defy gravity.
But the side of it
is a real mess, isn't it?
-It may taste fantastic yet.
-Let's hope so.
I could happily eat a bowl of that.
Oh.
I think your flavour's nice.
Just neaten up
your work a little bit more.

*Freya*
I think those flowers look incredible.
You spent some time on that.
It's chocolate sponge,
Kirsch buttercream,
then a little bit of cherry jam as well.
-Hmm. I think that's lovely.
-Ah, awesome.
It's very boozy.
I think it's delicious, you have got
a nice chocolatey flavour there.
Nice kick from the alcohol as well.
You've got some beautiful textures
running through there. And it's vegan.
I think you've done a great job.
-Really, really good job.
-Oh, thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

*Crystelle*
[Paul] It's very elegant.
I think the pipe work is beautifully done.
Between you and Freya, you've done
an amazing job with these flowers.
[Prue] You certainly hit
the gravity-defying
because you cannot believe
that such a heavy cake
is not going to fall over.
And just remind us about what the cake is.
It's a cinnamon sponge with a vanilla
Italian meringue buttercream
and roasted pecans.
[Prue] Mmm. That's good.
[chuckles] I got exactly that.
-Exactly as you said it.
-[sighs in relief]
It's absolutely
beautifully flavoured. Lovely.
[Paul] The cinnamon hit
is very powerful, but it works
because you balance that out
with the vanilla as well.
The nuts leave
that little bit of texture as well.
You created something
that is actually quite remarkable.
-I absolutely agree.
-Thank you so much.
-Well done.
-It really is lovely.

*Rochica*
You definitely got
the excitement in there.
[Paul] You probably could have done
with a little bit more detail.
[Prue] Look at that,
apple and caramel. How lovely.
-Oh, your flavours are lovely.
-Thank you.
The antigravity is certainly there.
It needs to be a little bit more honed.
Yeah.

*Tom*
I have to say I'm a bit disappointed
about the gravity-defying bit.
It was a bit of a disaster, to be honest.
It's a lemon and almond cake.
-It's rather more almond than lemon.
-Yeah.
Although there is a little bit of a lean,
there's no way that's defying gravity.
Fair enough.

*Giuseppe*
It is simply beautiful,
and it's certainly gravity-defying,
especially as you've got
the cloud off-centre.
So that really makes you feel
this should fall over.
[Paul] It's a great kids' cake.
Let's have a look.
[exhales]
The inside of the cake
is like an inside sponge
with a raspberry jam
and a cream cheese buttercream.
-The sponge is a little dry.
-Okay.
Good flavour though. Really good.
[Paul] Flavour's superb.
Because of the size of the cake,
I would've put two layers in there.
Right. Okay.
[Prue] It's true. If you'd had three
layers of sponge and a bit more filling,
you wouldn't have noticed
the dryness so much.
It's a pity, because you've
absolutely nailed the illusion bit.

*Jurgen*
-I think it's so elegant, don't you?
-Yeah.
It's so clean and simple,
but beautifully done.
-[Paul] Is the cake in this?
-Yes.
There is. So, this is the rod support.
And then you…
With a plinth and you
put the cake on that?
Er, yes, and I've got
two more supporting discs inside.
It's well-engineered.
[Jürgen] The cake is an orange
chiffon sponge with honey buttercream
with a hint of rose and pistachio praline.
I'm glad you said hint,
because rose can be so strong.
Yes.
You've got the rose absolutely right.
You can hardly taste it, but it's there.
It's beautiful because the chiffon's
quite a light sponge.
Then you've got texture
coming from the nuts
which gives you a beautiful flavour.
And in the background,
you've got this rose floating through.
So technically,
the way you baked it is perfect.
You could become the flavour king.
-Very, very good.
-Thank you very much.
