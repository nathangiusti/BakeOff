*Dave*
-[Prue] Hi, Dave.
-[Dave] Hello.
Hi, Dave. Right.
I think they look very neat.
They do look very good.
Thank you.
[Prue] They cut neatly.
The custard middle, I think,
is absolutely delicious
and the texture's perfect.
Thank you.
[Prue] The jelly is
surprisingly thick and I like it.
[Dave laughs]
I was worried
about the amount of gelatine.
Did you hold back
or did you put it all in?
I did put it all in.
I was expecting it to be
a little bit rubbery.
-But it wasn't, 'cause it did melt.
-Yeah.
I think you've done a good job.
You've ticked all the boxes.
-It's neat. And it tastes good.
-Thank you, cheers.
-Well done.
-Thank you. [exclaims]

*Hermine*
They do look really pretty.
[Noel] They look amazing.
It's a bit stodgy.
It's not as silky as I'd hoped.
[Paul] The base is very soft.
There's no way that base could
be solid in the bottom of that
because it's gonna sweat in there.
The moisture from the cheesecake filling
will drop in there and soften it up.
There's not enough lime in there.
Or passion fruit.
-[Paul] Or passion fruit.
-[Prue] Hmm.
It looks good. Thank you.
Thank you.

*Marc*
-They're not canapé size.
-Okay.
[Paul] I would've done it
slightly bigger than the apricot.
-That's too big and too thin.
-Yeah.
You don't get any apricot at all
until you hit the apricot.
-[Paul] Don't get the vanilla, either.
-Really? Oh, no.
It needed to be smaller,
packed with more flavour.
More vanilla.
-[Paul] And just look much neater.
-Sure, okay.
The apricot should've been everywhere
'cause when you get a bit of
apricot with it, it was truly delicious.
-Sure, okay.
-Thank you.
Thank you.

*Peter*
[exhales]
Hmm. It doesn't
look like a cheesecake. Erm…
-Oh.
-The mixture itself must be delicate.
It has formed a little cauldron.
There's your cheesecake.
Look at the ridge round there.
You've dropped a lot of height on that.
I think the flavour is absolutely lovely.
But the shape of it's not perfect.
I'm getting the lime.
The ginger's very light.
It's a nice flavour but it is lime.
I'm not getting much ginger
and it doesn't look
the best thing you've done.
-Thank you.
-Sorry.

*Laura*
So, Laura, just remind us
what's in your cheesecakes?
It's a vanilla cheesecake
with an oat-and-honey base,
passion fruit curd
and a passion fruit and mango…
what's supposed to be a compote on top
but it's a bit of a mudslide.
-I'm so sorry.
-Looks a bit messy.
What I like is the ratio
to the base and height
and that's pretty consistent
however wobbly they are.
I hope you like the taste.
I think they're nice.
Mmm, it's delicious.
-Yay.
-[Paul] That's fantastic.
The textures are all there from the top
to the cheesecake to the base
which you actually break through.
And the passion fruit's there
but not overwhelming.
There's absolutely nothing
the matter with this…
except the look.
-I'll take that. Thank you.
-Thank you, Laura.

*Laura*
Laura, would you like
to bring up your showstopper.
You can see it reminds you
-of, uh, a pond.
-Yeah.
[Paul] I love the way
you've put the flowers in there.
It's got bubbles in it.
That's the koi bubbling.
-Yeah.
-[Prue] It's brilliant.
[Paul] I'd like the sponge
to have been covered.
-Oh, okay.
-So it looks neater.
[Prue] That jelly looks nice and soft.
Mmm. The raspberry mousse
is particularly good.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Lovely.
-It's perfect.
-[Prue] Lovely.
[Paul] Every layer is excellent.
The jelly melts in the mouth,
the elderflower works really well,
every single texture,
every single flavour is spot on for me.
-Wow. Thank you so much.
-[Noel] Well done.
[Laura] Thanks.
-Smashed it, well done.
-Thank you.

*David*
David, I think
it is absolutely astonishing.
It is completely beautiful.
They are my colours exactly.
Yeah, if Prue was
a jelly design cake, that'd be it.
-Erm.
-[laughs]
[Prue] Very clever.
[Paul] I've given you a massive piece.
[Prue] David, that is so neat.
Thank you.
Jelly is fantastic. It's nice and light,
melts in the mouth.
But your downfall is the bit underneath.
Is that clotted cream mousse?
-[Dave] Yes.
-[Paul] Too much gelatine in it.
-Yeah.
-It's too stodgy.
Your sponge itself,
I'm not getting chocolate,
and I'm certainly not getting the fudge.
So when you eat that with that,
-it feels dry.
-All right, okay.
I wouldn't be quite so harsh.
My only quarrel is with the mousse,
which isn't as silky soft as you expect.
But do you know what, I think
it's quite an achievement, David, really.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] I think it's beautiful.
-[Dave] Thank you.
-[Matt and Noel] Well done.

*Peter*
It's very abstract.
[Prue] So that's a reindeer,
and that's a snowman.
And that's a Christmas tree.
Then it's repeated.
I don't think it looks very like
a snow globe.
[Paul] Needed bolder colours.
When you think of a Christmas tree,
you don't think pale.
-Yeah.
-You needed more vibrancy to it
'cause it's a bit pastel.
Let's have a look inside.
-There's mousse right down to the centre.
-[Prue chuckling]
[Paul] Not the easiest cake to cut.
No. [chuckles]
I question whether those mousses
are actually set properly yet.
They're very, very soft.
Okay.
Your sponge is slightly overbaked,
you can tell by the colour.
It shouldn't be as dark as that.
The flavours, though, are beautiful.
[Prue] I think the main problem
is with the size.
Because it's difficult
to get a huge slice out.
And because the mousses are only just set,
it's just like a good trifle.
-I'm gonna have the other mouthful.
-Thank you.
-Well done.

*Marc*
The strawberry mousse looks curdled
and not set.
-[Marc] Yeah.
-This is gonna be an interesting cut.
It's on a board, as well…
The jelly's on top of a board?
Yeah.
[snaps]
[Paul] Oh, dear. It's slightly overdone.
-[Marc] Yeah.
-It's like concrete.
[Prue] Oh, dear.
[Prue and Paul laughing]
Excuse me, Prue.
[Prue] Is that meant to be mousse,
that chocolate?
-Supposed to be.
-[Paul] Is it?
That's more like a ganache.
Your chocolate is hard.
-Yeah.
-[Paul] The mousse split.
-The dacquoise is overbaked.
-And the jelly is…
The jelly's too rubbery.
-But besides that, brilliant.
-[Prue laughs]
I like the design. You're the only one
-who thought to do a two-tier.
-Yeah.
I just don't think
you organised the cake as a one-piece.
-I don't think the concept was right.
-No.
[Marc] Right.

*Hermine*
-Beautiful.
-[Prue] Absolutely.
-Thank you.
-Straight out of a Parisian patisserie.
[exclaims]
[Prue] And I'll tell you what,
I'm a hot stuff gardener
and that is the most perfect
Japanese poppy.
Thank you.
[Paul] Right.
[chuckles]
It's absolutely gorgeous.
The raspberry, the chocolate mousse
work beautifully well together.
And you've got that aromatic flavour
coming from the jelly. Fantastic.
[Prue] All the layers are interesting.
The poppy top is fantastic.
And you know how to make genoise,
and you've made a perfect one.
-[Hermine] Thank you.
-It's a real triumph, lovely.
Well done, Hermine.
Oh, the white chocolate ganache
is delicious, too.
-[Prue] It is.
-Take it away.
-[all laughing]
-Go away before we find something
-to complain about.
-Thank you. [laughs]
Well done.
[chuckles]


Wow, that was incredible.
It was good.
[Prue] I think it was
the most amazing day today.
[Matt mumbling]
-[Noel] Hermine?
-[Paul] She's done an amazing job.
It reminded me of looking in the window
of Fauchon in Paris.
You know, it's got that elegance to it.
And Laura's was really good.
It was a bit untidy round the edges.
-Yeah.
-But the cake was great,
the two mousses were good.
The topping was lovely.
[Paul] When you look at David's,
for me, it was two halves.
The top half was amazing.
Probably the best one.
But, for me, the bottom half didn't work.
Peter's tasted really nice,
but it wasn't
the best thing he's ever done.
-[Noel] You said it was too big to cut.
-[Paul] It was, a bit.
When you cut a slice, you wanna be
taking that around to show people.
-[Prue] Yeah.
-As opposed to Marc's, a chainsaw.
-[laughs]
-Because the dacquoise was just overbaked.
-I could've stood on that.
-Poor Marc.
I felt so sorry for him.
-Yeah.
-[Matt] We all do.
[Prue] Nothing went right.
We're beginning to narrow it down,
so we're looking at mistakes.
The technical was bad for all of them,
even for the winner, Laura.
Then we look at the signature,
it was fairly tight,
you know, they all managed to produce
mini cheesecakes of one form or another.
So when it came to the showstopper,
we've gotta look at that more carefully
because it was
a four and a half hour challenge.
You can't just brush that off.
We've got to look
at the showstopper properly.
Bakers, I have got the great job
of announcing who is Star Baker this week.
Before I do that, I just wanna say
that showstopper was off the hook.
It really was amazing,
so well done, all of you.
Now, this week's Star Baker is…
Hermine.
-[sighs]
-[all clapping]
-[Marc] Well done.
-Thank you.
[mouthing] Wow. Thank you.
Well, it falls to me then to tell you
who's leaving us this week.
It's someone who's been
on an incredible journey,
and I know that that journey
will continue after this show.
And the person
who is leaving us this week is…
I'm so sorry, it's Marc.
It's okay.
-[Dave] Come on.
-See you.
-Give us a hug.
-Cheers, mate.
Enjoy the sun.
Yeah. Thank you, Prue.
[Prue] Oh, I'm sorry.
-I knew I'd reached my limit this week.
-[chuckles]
I'm feeling, erm,
surprisingly okay, actually.
-[Laura] I'll miss you.
-[Marc] You, too.
I've come to the Bake Off
to kind of face my anxieties,
failure, all those things that, as people,
we're uncomfortable about dealing with.
I've definitely learnt more about myself.
Maybe, from what lots of people have said,
it's just to give myself a bit more credit
as well, which I don't.
[Marc] Cheers, Paul.
[Paul] Marc's been great.
He's been on probably the biggest journey
out of all the bakers.
He started off pretty badly,
and then, as each week has passed by,
he's got better and better and better.
And it's a shame to see him go.
-[Peter] Survived.
-[Prue] Just.
[indistinct chatter]
I'm through to the semi final.
[chuckling] I'll take that.
It's kind of hard right now
'cause it's like, fortunate for me,
but I'm gonna miss Marc
and it's a bit of an odd feeling.
[Laura] Bittersweet.
Happy you've got through
but the shine's taken off of it,
especially when you lose someone
you're close to.
And, erm, I think Marc was,
erm, a real gent.
-[Paul] Well done, Hermine.
-Thank you.
Can't believe it.
I still think myself in the tent,
nervous about
whether that jelly will set or not.
And I can't believe they liked
that flower and the whole thing.
[Prue] Aren't you a clever girl?
Hermine, her second Star Baker in a row.
She is an amazing baker.
In the past, she's done really well
because she's kept it quite safe,
but this time,
she made this amazing Japanese poppy.
It was just beautiful.
Semi-final week next week.
And we've got four fantastic bakers,
and I still cannot call
who's gonna be in the final.
I don't think it's sunk in yet
that the semi final is coming up.
I don't… It just doesn't feel real.
[exhales] Like, mind blown.
