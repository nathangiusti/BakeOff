*Liam*
-Nice.
All the same colour and there is 24.
Tick, tick, tick.
-So far.
-Right, let's have a look.
[Prue] Gosh. They are a bit squishy.
[Sandi] Got it. Totally got it.
I will just stand here
and catch it, Paul Hollywood's drippings.
That's actually what's happening here.
But I think, from a flavour point of view,
they are very interesting.
-You get a malt kick.
-Yes.
-Coffee kick.
-Get in.
It's really good. But this is a meal.
-I think they are too chunky.
-Yeah.
See me, that's what it says
on the bottom of your work.

*James*
You have made 24
almost identical biscuits.
Very delicious.
I'm getting vanilla, certainly
getting rhubarb, which is lovely.
I didn't get the custard, but it's vanilla
so it gives you that sensation
of rhubarb and custard,
but quality of the biscuit is fantastic.

*Chris*
A very rich bitter chocolate.
The whiskey is, wow,
it's coming through at the end.
Beautiful, isn't it?
[Prue] Do you know, I think it's too much.
It's got the concentration
of a chocolate truffle.
Ah, okay.

*Yan*
[Prue] They do look
absolutely perfectly even.
[crunching]
Oh, sorry about that. A bit oozy.
No denying the banana and peanut.
If the cream filling would have set,
it would have been a fantastic biscuit.

*Flo*
It does look very intriguing.
Filling looks a little squashy.
[Paul] Your biscuit is quite hard.
I think you have worked that too much.
-You think so?
-Yep.
There is no gin flavour.
But I think the flavour is wonderful
especially the raspberry jam.

*Steven*
I love that chewy middle,
and it is still quite crisp outside.
The only issue is the slight
irregular sizes,
but the flavours and the texture
of the almond and the coffee together,
and the slight chewiness
in the bite, perfect.
Thank you.

*Kate*
[Paul] The icing
is a little bit dodgy, isn't it?
Very dodgy.
It's so tough,
it's offering me out for a fight.
[Prue] It is too tough.
A story of two halves.
The pineapple's there,
delicious flavour, yum.

*Stacey*
-I think they look amazing.
-Thank you.
You have got consistency,
I think they look very neatly filled.
Obviously, a little bit concerned
about that amount of glitter.
-Taste great.
-Thank you.
Crispy on the outside,
soft and cookie-like on the inside,
and the marshmallow has set beautifully
so when you bite in, it doesn't pour out.
And in fact, with fluff like that
which is pure sugar,
it's clever not to have
the biscuit too sweet.
As a sandwich biscuit,
you have ticked all the boxes. Well done.
Thank you.

*Julia*
They are dancing biscuits.
Aren't they? Look at them.
Boi-ing, boi-ing.
That's great that.
They are a little bit scruffy.
Very different, but because
everything's a bit strong, it's too much.
[Paul] You have this mix
of rosewater and cardamom,
which isn't particularly pleasant.
But very daring of you to do it, though.
[Sandi] And the most fun
we have had so far.
Yeah, I'm just gonna do
that one more time. Yeah.
-That's just lovely.
-[Paul] That's quite incredible.

*Sophie*
You were asked for 24
absolutely identical biscuits
and I think you might have hit it.
They look incredible.
Sharp, nice clean lines,
distinction between the two sides.
A bit of drippage.
That's delicious.
Thank you.
[Paul] Can't really taste the limoncino,
you just get a beautiful citrus flavour.
[Prue] Beautifully cooked, very tart.
What's not to like? It's wonderful.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

*Tom*
I like the look of them. I think
the bake's good, I think the size is good.
[Prue] Tell us about the filling?
The chocolate one is just
a chocolate ganache,
the central one is coffee and amaretto.
The cream is very rich in chocolate.
The amaretto flavour is delicious.
The biscuit dough is a triumph.
[Tom] Thank you.


Sophie, please bring up
your biscuit board game.
Well, I must say
it's very beautifully neat.
You haven't had to ice the whole thing.
[Paul] The blocks all look equal.
That is very good.
[Prue] Beautiful dice.
[Paul] I think we need to try
some of this.
I love the lemon flavour, bergamot.
-[Prue] Afterwards you get it.
-There is a little bit right at the end.
-[Sophie] Okay. Yeah.
-But it works.
It's beautiful, crispy snap.
Snakes and Ladders is a classic game
and I think you have done
a very, very good job.
That was a lot better than I expected.
Well done.
I love the colours, bright as anything.
Edges are terrific. It's very neat.
The board is a mixed spice.
Hmm. Very spicy and Christmassy.
[Paul] And soft. As a biscuit,
that is too soft for me.
But the overall design is fantastic,
very much an architect's piece of work.
The overall game
is a little disappointing.
Yeah.
[Paul] The biscuits are delicious.
[Prue] Aren't they?
There is not much ginger coming through,
but there is lots of lime.
Texture, it's very, very good as well.
You make your way around
the board towards Noel and Sandi.
[laughter]
[Paul] It's a shame
all this has broken off
cos what you have essentially done
is made a lot of different biscuits
and piped different numbers on them.
The lemony one is lovely.
The biscuit's been overworked slightly.
It's quite rubbery. The matcha
comes through, that's pretty much it.
James, I love the colours
I mean they are my kind of colours,
-they are bang in your face.
-Exactly.
[Prue] I really love that.
Cones have sort of worked.
Every time I move it,
a little bit more falls off.
-Is that part of the game?
-It has to be a quick game.
[Prue] I must say
the texture is nice to eat.
[Paul] That chocolate is delicious,
melts in the mouth,
the flavour's very good.
The actual board game, the way
you have set it up, is a nice idea.
Thank you.
Flo, please bring up
your biscuit board game.
-Do I have to?
-Yes.
That's Mr. Neverwell.
I'm not surprised.
[all laughing]
So, you picked these up and you try
and pick up one of these things here?
[Prue] Very good.
It certainly looks striking.
But it is a bit messy, isn't it?
-And you made your fondant, didn't you?
-Yeah.
-And you didn't need to.
-No.
[Flo] The man's almond,
the other one is vanilla.
-There is not a lot of difference between.
-Not a lot of difference between the two.
They are both great biscuits,
they are crumbly, they break easily,
there is no chew to it at all.
Simplistic, but actually it does the job.
Well done, Flo.
He's getting bin bagged. After today.
You spin the compass and depending
on which number it lands on
is how many spaces you move.
That works quite well, doesn't it?
It's a bit rough and ready.
Its colourful which is a good thing.
[Prue] And the little boats
are quite neat.
The landmark is rum and ginger.
That's Scotland leaving England.
[all laughing]
You do want your own teeth,
I must tell you.
Both the biscuits are burnt.
The flavours are okay.
I think the most impressive
thing is your compass.
No one has ever said that to me before.
Not your strong point then.
[Paul] I think
it does look a little bit messy.
[Kate] I just didn't have time
to like decorate it
in the way that I wanted to.
I think it looks a little
more like a jungle swamp.
That's the lemon and paradise one.
I am not getting the grains of paradise.
[Prue] No, I can't taste them.
It's a little bit solid.
I don't think eating that is
going to be a huge pleasure.
[Paul] It looks a bit unfinished because
once the board was done
you just spent the rest of the time
cutting out these shapes.
You could have decorated
them a little bit more.
Fantastic flavour.
The lemon honey and ginger is delicious.
To get the honey, the lemon and ginger
all together is quite tricky to do.
The board game is a chocolate
orange and cinnamon.
And it's got chocolate chips in it.
Mmm-hmm.
I have to say I think
it's absolutely delicious.
It's just crumbly and melting and yum.
I would like to see more decoration,
but the biscuits are the star of the show.
-Which game do you want to play?
-Noughts and crosses.
Okay, you be the noughts.
Okay, cool.
-You could have won?
-[Liam] I know.
-[Sandi] Paul.
-I would never do that.
[all laughing]
Well done.
I will be getting drunk tonight.
Steven, would you like to bring
your biscuit board game up?
[Sandi] Yeah, I think I'm gonna help.
This is a bit scary.
Okay.
That is exceptional.
Thank you.
[Paul] The work
that you have got on the top
is sublime, it is very delicate.
[Prue] It's a little masterpiece.
You have a great bake,
it's a great tasting gingerbread.
[Prue] It's very good because the fondant
isn't too thick.
Hmm.
[Paul] The orange flavour is delicious.
It's very well-designed
and it's as neat as a pin.
[Paul] Very, very clever,
well done, Steven.
[Steven] Thank you.
[Tom] Well done.
Oh, mate.
[Sandi] Stacey, please bring up
your biscuit board game.
The board game is a made-up
game called Get to School.
There are three players,
I've got three boys.
It is so neat and so beautifully done.
The piping is good and the sweet,
little school blazer is just exquisite.
[Stacey] That's vanilla and strawberry.
-Slightly chewy, quite rubbery.
-Yeah.
-Sorry.
-Erm, I'm not getting much flavour.
From an eating point of view,
that's much more icing
than you need on that bit of biscuit.
The chocolate is dry as a bone.
The texture is all wrong,
it just crumbles into nothing.
[Prue] It's a beautifully conceived game,
but the flavour and the texture
is not so wonderful.
Do you not think we look like four people
who couldn't agree
what game they wanted to play?
[all chuckles]
So, we cut them all into bits.
[Sandi] I loved this challenge,
an incredible array
of imagination on display.
Absolutely, and some terrific skill, too.
[Paul] Steven's was exquisite.
And then Tom's, I mean,
that could have come out of a magazine.
[Paul] It's the same
when you look at Sophie's
and the taste
of those biscuits were divine.
[Sandi] Chris came into
the showstopper in trouble.
His problem was that
he just never got near the end.
[Paul] Stacey's although, it looked great,
the biscuits were bone dry.
You know Kate struggled as well.
She didn't finish her bake.
[Prue] She is too ambitious.
Flo didn't do brilliantly today,
and she was not pleased with herself.
So, it's not as clean cut as you think
when you look down at the bottom.
It has got to be more
of a conversation about who is going.
[Prue] But I think we will agree
on who is star baker.
I think so.
-That's my head.
-I know.
I'm short enough.
Well, bakers, thank you
for some wonderful board games.
I have got the lovely job
of announcing star baker.
The star baker this week
produced some exquisite detail
in the showstopper.
The star baker is Steven.
So of course, that means
I have the difficult job
of announcing
who is going to be leaving us.
The baker leaving the tent is...
Chris.
Ah.
What a surprise.
Come on, let's have a hug, come on.
[Chris] I am disappointed I never got
to make any breads,
any pastries, the things
that fit my style of baking.
I am just so honoured
and privileged to have got in that tent.
Everything fell to pieces for him,
it's a real shame, you know,
because he has got some fantastic ideas.
All right, mate, well done.
[Sandi] Are you happy to get through?
[Liam] Just a little bit.
Gulp. [laughs]
Dodged a bullet there
but, yeah, happy with that.
[indistinct chatter]
I am not disappointed I didn't get
star baker, maybe another week.
-The double.
-You're going for a double, he is greedy.
I mean, he has done the double.
[Steven] I don't think
I will ever get used to this feeling,
it's alien to me.
I have bullied myself so much in my life
that finally I am getting praise,
I don't know what to do with it.
[Flo] This week,
I let myself down terrible.
I expected to go home.
Come here.
You are not getting rid of me
that easy, are you?
