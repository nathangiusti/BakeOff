*Marc*
You're lacking on the number of pleats.
-How many should there be?
-I think it's 20 or 21.
I was getting close.
You're about seven, eight short.
-Yeah.
-[Prue chuckles]
[Paul] The biggest
problem is that they look a bit pale.
Especially this one.
You haven't brushed it properly.
Flavour's good but it's bone-dry.
You have cream in that?
-Yeah.
-[Paul] Probably a little more cream.
That would've given you
more moisture in the mouth.
-A bit too dry for me.
-[Marc] Okay.
Lovely pastry. I think that
if you'd done it faster and hotter,
-you might've kept more of the colour.
-Okay.

*Peter*
The overall look of this one is fantastic.
It is like a flat fish. Looks great.
[Prue] I was a bit
worried it would be stodgy,
but in fact, it's certainly not.
If anything, it's a bit dry.
There's a nice kick of flavour there,
but unfortunately,
you've got rice sitting on a pastry,
which is very good, but quite dry.

*Lottie*
They're a bit messy. You've lost the
definition in the pleats across the top.
-But I like the colour of them.
-[Prue] I think it's very witty.
[Paul] Very flaky, which is good.
[whispers] Nice.
They taste amazing.
The mash works really well.
Do you remember
I said it won't work? I was wrong.
It is very, very good.
It doesn't look good,
but the textures, the flavours
are all spot on. Tastes amazing.

*Dave*
[Prue] They're very nice and even.
They're nicely glazed, well-baked.
They're the right colour.
-Those are little chillies on top.
-[Dave] Yes.
-[Prue] They're very impressive.
-Thank you.
I think your flavour's okay.
I think it's a bit dry.
You put too much rice in there.
-Okay.
-[Paul] Because the rice
is gonna dry everything out
and soak everything in.
You lost the flavour of the chicken.
But otherwise,
the pastry's good and it's all right
to eat, it just doesn't wow me.
Okay, fair enough.
-[Prue] Can I taste it with your sauce?
-[Dave] Yes. Yeah.
That would've made a huge difference.
It has that sweetness and the chilli,
and there's a bit of kick.
Thank you.

*Mark*
[Prue] You know, that is really
what a pasty should look like.
It's full, the pastry looks beautiful.
Soft and tender.
But firm enough to,
if not hurl over a hedge,
-at least hold in your hand.
-[chuckles]
It tastes beautiful.
The spices in there, the chilli in there,
it's just the right amount.
It's got a nice kick of heat.
The textures are spot on.
It's gorgeous. Very good.
Heaven.

*Hermine*
Another couple
of minutes perhaps in the oven.
I was running behind…
-[Paul] So you were rushing…
-A bit, yes.
-Nice and full.
-[Paul] Mmm-hmm.
That's beautiful.
The lamb's cooked beautifully.
-Thank you.
-[Paul] The flavours, the spices.
Just the right amount
of veg to meat. It's beautiful.
[Paul] That's a lovely pasty.
Because you've got a good
pastry on the outside, it's quite buttery.
-[Prue] It's really delicious.
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much indeed.
-Well done.
Thank you.

*Linda*
You did read the stuff about
we were going to want them crimped?
-Did you miss that?
-Oh. I missed that in the brief. Sorry.
-So we have a samosa, essentially.
-[Linda] Yes.
[Paul] I like the colour of them.
They're a little bit white in places
and broken up slightly.
Bit longer in the oven.
[Linda] Yes, absolutely.
[Prue] Your stencilling didn't work…
-[Linda] No.
-[Prue] You know what,
-it looks very nice.
-[Paul] The flavours are fantastic.
You've got the idea
of the samosa right in there.
I'd like to have seen the crimping.
-Hmm.
-[Paul] But what I do like
is the combination of
the butteriness with the samosa filling.
Would be a delicious lunch.
-[Paul] Well done.
-Thank you.

*Laura*
Nice colour. You've got
a beautiful golden brown colour.
Got a little bit of crimping on the edge.
-Bit irregular in size.
-I like that they're nice and fat.
Good lots of filling in there.
[Paul] Nice flaky pastry. The filling
in there going right to the sides.
Mmm…
Heaven. I love that.
It's flaky, pastry's holding together.
It's moist in the middle
but not wet. I could gobble it up.
-[Paul] Hmm.
-Thank you.
You've got
the perfect blend of ingredients.
-Texture and flavour is spot on.
-Thank you.
[Prue and Paul] Well done.
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

*Dave*
Dave, would you like
to bring up your showstopper please?
I think it looks great. I like the look
you've achieved with the mango.
I think it's wonderful.
All it has to do now is taste great.
Fingers crossed.
[Paul] It's nice and neat.
The flavour is absolutely lovely.
Love the mango.
The base is just about
the right thickness.
It marries beautifully with the mango.
You've done a great job.
You've given an impact
to the top of the tart as well.
[Prue] The overall look is so harmonious.
-Well done.
-Very good job.
-Cheers, thank you.
-[Prue] Really good.

*Marc*
[Paul] It looks highly effective.
The colour looks very good.
I like the way the tart looks.
It looks great.
Lovely and rich, the chocolate.
I do have a problem with the base.
-It's a bit big for the chocolate.
-Yeah.
But your decoration is very beautiful.
[Paul] I'd like to have seen
this chocolate to the edge
of a very rich chocolate pastry,
which is really thin.
-It would've been spot-on.
-Okay.
'Cause that base looks awkward.
It doesn't belong
-to that delicate chocolate in there.
-Okay, sure.

*Hermine*
I think it looks beautiful.
It's a really clever design
and you've managed to get it to work.
-Until Paul Hollywood wrecked it.
-[Noel] Ah.
-[Paul] Right.
-[all laughing]
[Noel] Thunder fingers.
However, that shows
that the pastry will be delicious.
Flavour's lovely. But you could've
made the base a little thinner.
[Hermine] Okay.
But I have to say,
the pastry is beautiful.
[Paul] It is really good.
However, this is a really big, hefty
Paul Hollywood… [grunts] cage.
-[laughing]
-With a delicate, tiny, feminine middle.
It's a Prue Leith tart
with a Paul Hollywood base.
[all laughing]
[Paul] Overall, I think
all your flavours are absolutely spot on.

*Laura*
I'm very impressed with your cage.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] It looks lovely.
[Paul] It's highly impressive.
The tart underneath looks very nice.
Mmm. I love the key lime flavour.
The lime, you can feel it
at the back of your…
-[Prue] Mmm.
-…cheeks.
It's like… ooh. I like that from lime.
That's how a lime should taste,
give you a nice kick.
Your decoration's beautiful.
Overall, I think
it tastes amazing, looks good.
-[Prue] Excellent.
-You've excelled yourself.
[Prue] Hmm, you really have.
Wow, thank you.
That means a lot to me. Thank you.

*Linda*
What happened to the cage?
It usually lifts up,
but today it stayed on the bowl.
-[Prue] I love the, erm, gypsy colours.
-That's right.
[Prue] Okay, let's taste it.
Mmm. I love the flavour.
[Paul] It's a bit thick, that gypsy tart.
It could've been a little bit thinner.
Erm, I like the flavour.
It's very traditional.
It's quite frustrating
that you don't see the full impact.
The way it looks doesn't look good.

*Lottie*
Well, I have to say
your cage is sensational.
Really beautiful.
[Paul] The artistry in there
is exceptional.
The tart itself, I question whether
it would be a tart without sides.
-[Prue] Very squidgy.
-Very.
Mmm.
[Prue] That tastes absolutely beautiful.
But it does look a right mess.
All the independent flavours
are very, very good.
All the textures are good.
What you've made
is very good, but is it the brief,
is my question.

*Peter*
I like the rather
random way you've done the cage.
-I think it's really beautiful.
-[Paul] Quite solid.
Almost looks like it's made of bread.
Almost looks like it's made of bread.
Just happy it's held up.
-[laughs]
-[Prue] Hmm.
Lovely and tart.
[Prue and Paul] Mmm.
That's delicious.
-Puts a smile on your face.
-Very nice. Lovely.
That's partly because
the back of your cheeks are going…
-So it forces a smile.
-[chuckles]
That's called a happy tart, that one.
That's lovely.

*Mark*
-[Prue] So, the cage didn't work.
-[Paul] It's not a good one.
Not compared with what you were
achieving recently. That's not…
-[Mark] Yeah.
-[Paul] …Mark.
Your piping's all irregular as well.
The poached pears don't look appetising.
It's delicious.
It's unusual, but I really like it.
The pastry's far too thick.
You missed something on this one.
At a core level, not just at the fact
that you never got a chance
to finish it with the cage.


I thought they did quite well
after the éclairs.
[Prue] The cages were astonishing,
except for Mark L.
[Noel and Prue] And Linda's.
I think, in spite of her exploding cage,
Hermine must be in line for Star Baker.
I thought the flavours of
her lemon tarte au citron was fantastic.
You did quite like Dave's.
[Paul] I thought his cage was incredible.
What about Peter?
'Cause you liked his as well.
-I did like Peter's.
-[Noel] He came first in technical.
Is he not in line for Star Baker?
-He struggled in his signature.
-Right.
[Paul] But I think
Laura's showstopper was amazing.
-Laura's had a good week.
-She's really come up.
So who is in danger of going home?
Mark L, his cage fell apart.
He could be in a little bit of trouble.
Erm, Marc E.
He struggled in the technical
and he struggled in the signature.
I think Linda's in trouble.
Struggled across the first two challenges,
didn't finish her cage.
-Close, then.
-It is. It's painfully close.
Well done, bakers. You must be exhausted.
I'm sure you want to know
who Star Baker is.
So I'll tell you.
Star Baker this week is…
Laura.
[all clapping]
-[Matt] Congratulations, Laura.
-[imperceptible]
That leaves me with the rotten job
of announcing the person
that is leaving us this week.
It does get harder every week
'cause there's less of you
and we get to know you more.
The person who's leaving us this week is…
Linda. I'm sorry.
No, that's good. [laughs]
I can't really be sad.
I've been like a child
at Disneyland, really.
-Well done, you.
-[Laura] I'm so sorry.
It's been amazing.
One of the highlights of my life.
-[laughs]
-[Noel] How dare they?
Thank you so much.
She is a very good baker,
but she had a terrible week.
[Linda] I know I can bake.
I just haven't done enough.
I am so proud of myself. Yeah, I am.
-[Paul] Well done, Laura.
-Oh, thank you.
[Paul] Did well there.
I'm still a bit in shock,
like, I think I'm a bit like,
"Did that actually just happen"?
When it came to the showstopper,
Laura smashed it out of the park.
Well-deserved Star Baker.
I'm just gonna try and get through
for as long as I can.
Hashtag, winging it. [chuckles]
Looking forward to next week,
Japanese Week.
Yeah, one more. Let's do one more week.
It's getting tougher now.
And I cannot mess up like that again.
Yeah, I'm gonna be better next week.
