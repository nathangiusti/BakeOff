*Giuseppe*
[Prue] They all look lovely.
[Paul] Let's start with
the orange and strawberry, shall we?
[Prue] That is beautifully done.
Really beautiful.
[Paul] The orange
in the shortbread is delicious.
Blends beautifully with the strawberry.
And the spice that you've got in there,
it's just perfect. Right.
Coffee and pecan, eh?
They're going to be lovely, I'm sure.
Unusual and delicious.
And the pecan, that nuttiness
that it brings to the coffee is perfect.
-Really lovely.
-Thank you.
Thank you.

*Crystelle*
[Paul] They look very nice.
[Prue] Let's see if they taste
half as good as they look.
[Crystelle] I have done
brown butter shortbread
with pistachios and cardamom.
I love the flavour.
It's quite unusual, too.
The second biscuits
are hazelnuts and orange zest
with a chocolate hazelnut filling.
So delicate, the orange. It's just right.
The amount of chocolate is perfect.
You've got that chew in the middle.
They're really interesting.
Beautifully made.
-Think they're a triumph. Well done.
-Thank you. [sighs in relief]

*Chigs*
[Chigs] So that's a vanilla shortbread
with raspberry jam and a disk of marzipan.
And the bottom ones are purely marzipan
with some orange.
[Paul] Your textures are beautiful.
-The marzipan you get, but can't taste.
-[Chigs] Okay.
[Prue] This one is nice and chewy
in the middle, crisp on the outside.
-Very good orange.
-[Paul] Your flavours are good,
but it's a shame
we didn't get marzipan coming through.
-But good job.
-Thank you.

*Lizzie*
[Prue] I just love your cheeky girls.
I mean, their little astonished mouths
and eyelashes going out the side
is just beautiful.
[Paul] It needed
slightly longer in the oven,
because it looks like raw paste.
The flavour with the cinnamon,
with the apple, is delicious.
The jam is spectacular.
I like the colour of these,
but they're all over the place.
I think they're a bit too big.
For me, there's too much chocolate.
If you manage to avoid the chocolate,
the almond flavour is delicious.
[Paul] If you'd made them half-size,
bake them properly,
you'd have been getting a handshake.
So if I'd just done it
completely different.
-[Paul] Yeah.
-[all laughing]

*Amanda*
I think the mulled wine biscuits are nice,
all 11 of them.
The orange and chocolate one,
it's lost its definition.
The biscuit tastes beautiful.
It's such a delicate, buttery biscuit.
-Let's have a look at these.
-[Noel] These are called hearts, Paul.
-Most normal people have them.
-[Prue chuckles]
-Never seen one before.
-[Noel chuckles]
-This is an astonishingly good biscuit.
-[Amanda] Thank you.
Biscuit is very short and buttery
and delicious.
The jam is sensational.
I mean, it really is worth every calorie.
-Thank you so much.
-[Paul] Thank you very much.

*George*
[Prue] I think that's lovely.
What's so good is that the kirsch
and the cherry acidity
makes the whole thing lighter.
And these ones should be quite crisp.
Is that right?
[George] They should be
crispy on the outside.
As they age,
they get crispy on the inside too.
-I mean, it's tough.
-[George] Yeah.
It's so tough,
it's offering me out for a fight.
But I love the flavours of both.
You've done really well.
I question whether that was
the right choice to use on this challenge.
I completely agree.
-[Prue chuckles]
-[Paul] But well done.
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

*Freya*
It's not supposed to be like that.
The bottom of the biscuits stuck.
Well, they're certainly chewy, Freya.
And they're delicious.
[Paul] Let's try this Christmas pud,
shall we?
I love the flavours.
But it is certainly overbaked.
-Yeah, yeah.
-[Prue] It is overbaked.
Fruit has got a bit burnt.
But the flavour's lovely.
Especially the lemon.

*Jurgen*
I think they look lovely.
You've got some uniformity here,
which I like to see.
I think they do look very nice.
I can't add anything to that.
I think they look absolutely perfect.
-Let's try the star one first.
-[Jürgen] Yep.
-I flavoured them with Earl Grey tea.
-[Prue] Tea?
-It really comes through nice and strong.
-[Paul] Mmm. Yeah.
Really like it. Right.
[Prue] The horns. Shall we do the horns?
The coffee…
You can smell the coffee, can't you?
That is the crumbliest,
buttery-est biscuit
I think I've ever eaten,
it is just perfect.
Thank you.
That's delicious.
I think you've done well there, Jürgen.
[contestants applauding]
[Jürgen] Thank you.
-[Paul] Good job.

*Lizzie*
[Paul] I like it.
I think you've made a real attempt
to create that finesse
that we're looking for. All right.
[Prue] Let's have a look.
[Paul] You ended up
with something very, very nice.
So you don't get that chew.
You get a cake-like quality.
I think it needs a little more sweetness,
either in a glaze or an icing.
But it's very nice and very pleasant.
-Well done.
-[Paul] Thank you, Lizzie.

*Crystelle*
I like the look of that.
The roses coming all the way down.
I like the uniformity of it.
As a package, it works together.
[Prue] This is the apple one?
[Crystelle] Yeah.
The cinnamon apples are in the centre
and the cream is piped 'round the outside.
[Prue] This is about as fattening
a mouthful as you could get.
The cream, the apple and cinnamon
work beautifully together.
I love the structure as well,
because it's quite light on the mouth.
Delicious.
Good job, Crystelle.
[Prue] Very good job.

*Chigs*
[Paul] It's quite pretty.
It's a bit dark. It's been overbaked.
Okay.
You can see how dark that is in places.
But I like the design though, it's clever.
[Prue] I like the crystallized candy peel,
it's really good.
But it's quite a tough eat, isn't it?
It's dry. Flavours are good, idea's good.
It's the overbaking that's done it for me.
-Thank you, Chigs.
-Thank you, guys. Thank you very much.

*Amanda*
It's quite effective.
Not very neat down at the bottom.
But you can cover up a world of problems
with almonds on the outside.
But its dependent on the flavour.
[Prue] That's a lot of fruit.
-Flavour's fantastic.
-That's beautiful.
The structure is perfect.
The bite is perfect.
The bake is spot-on.
I've never had anything
quite like that before.
Thank you.
[Paul] It's not
the best-looking thing I've seen.
But it's one of the best-tasting things
I've had for a long time.
Thank you so much.

*Freya*
[Paul] There's so much bleeding
coming from the plums.
[Prue] It is a bit messy-looking.
[Paul] If you had water icing
around the outside of each one,
it'd look neater.
[Prue] Should we taste it?
[Paul] Let's have a look.
The syrupy topping
is delicious, unusual and lovely.
But there's an awful lot
of dough to topping.
And I think it could have done
with a little more baking.
-[Paul] Yeah, it's too doughy.
-Yeah, it is underbaked.
-Yeah, it is.
-Got it.
-Thank you
-Thank you.
[Matt] Well done.

*George*
[Prue] I think it's very pretty.
It does look like an anniversary cake.
-[Paul] You need a stronger colour there.
-[George] Yeah.
See the colour you managed
to achieve down here?
You want the same up there.
You can see how light that is.
It's almost been treated like a soft roll.
-[George] Yeah.
-[Paul] All right.
[Prue] Let's have a look.
I love the flavour.
Chocolate-tahini balance is perfect.
[Paul] That's, erm… That's a raw dough.
-Oh, is it?
-[Prue] The middle is raw.
I think it's a bit clumsy,
it's been rushed.
-Thank you.
-Thank you

*Giuseppe*
[Prue] I think it looks absolutely lovely.
I really do.
And it's holding very well.
It doesn't seem to be squashing.
[Paul] I wanna go
straight down to the bottom.
-[all exclaiming]
-Well held.
[Giuseppe] Thank you.
Well, I ain't letting no cake go to waste.
Not on my watch.
[all laughing]
[Prue] That looks really lovely.
Light, it's almost like a panettone.
It's better than a panettone, that.
It's almost like a whisked sponge.
The cherries are delicious.
Nice and tart, but they're sweet
at the same time.
It's delicious. I think you've
done an amazing job.
-[Prue] Well done, Giuseppe.
-[Paul] Thank you, Giuseppe.

*Jurgen*
[Prue] I must say,
I think it looks really beautiful.
It's a lovely colour.
[Paul] I can't wait to see
what it looks like inside.
It's quite a breakfasty bake.
You think it's too bready?
It is very bready.
It's a little bit dry.
You have to be really delicate with this
sort of thing to get the air in it.
That could have opened up
considerably more to make it much lighter.
But the flavour is good.
Overall, I like it.
But I don't love it, which is a shame.


Let's talk about
who's in line for Star Baker.
Giuseppe's done really well.
I mean, he's really beginning
to get into his stride now.
Could be one to watch.
I think overall Jürgen…
Jürgen's done all right, actually.
-He had a handshake yesterday.
-He did.
I was a little bit disappointed
with his Showstopper.
But it looked so beautiful.
Because we think Jürgen is so good,
when he doesn't do something perfectly,
we bang on about it.
-That's still a very good yeasted cake.
-Yeah.
[Paul] I was a little bit
upset with George.
You know, they were doughy.
I think Freya's down there as well,
because Freya's Showstopper
wasn't as good as I was expecting.
[Prue] It was such a pity because
the actual syrup was delicious.
But it was that much cake
and a tiny bit of topping.
[Paul] In Star Baker position,
you've got Giuseppe, Jürgen,
and George and Freya down at the bottom.
Well, bakers,
thank you so much for joining us
for two gruelling days in this hot tent.
Now the Star Baker this week is…
-Is Giuseppe, congratulations.
-[all clapping]
[murmurs indistinctly]
And now we have to lose someone.
This gets harder and harder.
And the person
that we are losing this week
is someone who's brought
their own ideas into the tent.
And we're very, very sorry to see them go.
I'm afraid the person
who is leaving us this week is…
Is Freya.
-Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
-[sobbing]
I'm really sad Freya's going.
My God, she is so talented.
You are literally
the most put-together 19-year-old
I've ever met in my entire life.
That wait was agonising.
I thought, "I'm waiting
for my name to be called,
I'm waiting for my name,"
and then, you know, poor Freya.
Really gutted for her.
[Paul] It's very sad that Freya had to go.
She's done an amazing job.
She's 19 years old, vegan baking,
and she came halfway.
There you go. That's how good she is.
Should be really proud of yourself.
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Really proud of yourself.
Genuinely, I think it's the best
experience of my life.
[Prue] You know, you've done so well.
I was feeling
the lack of experience quite a lot.
So, you know, I am 19.
So I do feel really proud
to have even just been able to keep up.
So, like, to get to week five
and do it vegan,
erm, I just feel like I really have
done what I wanted to do being here.
[all] It's only vegan chocolate cake!
Giuseppe, he's done it again.
Giuseppe absolutely deserved
Star Baker. Yes. [chuckles]
Second Star Baker.
I can't… [clicks tongue]
I can't believe that.
I want to think only of the next step,
so next week, it's gonna put me under
a lot of pressure to perform well,
and that's, erm…
A difficult position to start in.
