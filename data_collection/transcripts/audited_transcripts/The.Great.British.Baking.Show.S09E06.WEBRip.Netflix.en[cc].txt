*George*
-Hello, George.
-Hi, George.
Hiya.
You've got a nice, robust mixture,
which has given you that pop.
This is a toffee and hazelnut chouxnut.
These are not filled.
Mm.
Toffee-ish, really nutty.
Goes nicely
with a soft choux.
-[Paul] Delicious.
-Lovely.
[Paul] Let's have a look
at your filled one.
It's got a Chantilly cream
with raspberry jam rippled through.
You've given me an empty bit.
It's important you get the filling
right the way around.
Quite often, I need two holes
so that I can squirt.
-You squeeze the bag.
-Yeah.
When you meet that little bit
of resistance,
usually means it's full.
[all sniggering]
Why are you laughing?
We're just children.
-You're grown up--
-Sorry, Dame Prue.
Exactly. Stop this nonsense.
-Tell him it's lovely.
-I think that you do…
-Sorry.
-[sniggers]
I think when you do get the cream filling
and the jam, it's delicious.
Thank you.

*Jurgen*
The filled ones have
a ube crème pat.
[Prue] That ube colour
is just extraordinary, isn't it?
That slightly vanilla-y ube taste is…
unusual, but sort of vaguely familiar.
[Paul] I think the structure
on that is very good.
It's nice and open.
-[Prue] It's very light.
-It's so delicate, it's lovely. Okay.
[Jürgen] These are
the unfilled ones.
They have a yuzu and sake glaze.
It has that little bit of acidity
which yuzu gives it.
-They're both delicious.
-Thank you.

*Chigs*
The filled ones,
they are Paris-Brest inspired.
I've got
praline cream in the middle.
Can't see the structure
'cause there's so much of the filling.
[Prue] I think Paris-Brest
should have lots of filling.
That's delicious. Mm.
[Chigs] This is
my chocolate lime chouxnut.
The cocoa, that's just enough
to marry with the lime.
It's unusual, but it does work.
-It's a nice chouxnut, that one.
-Thank you.
It's delicate.

*Giuseppe*
So, those are the empty chouxnuts
with almond praline.
-[Paul] Good frying.
-[Prue] Colour's nice, isn't it?
Contrast of the praline crunch
and the softness of the choux
is just lovely.
[Paul] Okay. Let's have
a look at your filled one.
Crème pat and limoncello.
It's definitely crème pat
with limoncello.
There is too much limoncello,
and I can't resist another mouthful.
-Ah-hah.
-[Paul] Mm.

*Crystelle*
-[Paul] This is the miso caramel…
-[Crystelle] And white chocolate.
[Paul] It is exactly how you said,
it's umami.
It's got a… You know,
it has got that bitterness to it.
And the tropical passionfruit choux,
it's just beautiful.
-But the choux itself is very tight.
-Yeah.
It's not open enough.
It should be… [blows air]
You've lost a lot of the definition.
Do you think you lost
some of the definition in the frying?
Yeah.
-You need to give it a bit of a hit.
-Yeah.
-The choux's let you down a little bit.
-Okay. Thank you.

*Amanda*
[Paul] Okay. The maple bacon.
It needs the bacon.
-Could have done with a tiny bit more.
-Yeah, that's a shame.
-Because I had so much left over.
-[Prue] Yeah.
[Paul] Let's have
a look at your filled one.
[Amanda] It's pistachio crème pat
with a rose glaze.
The, uh, rose,
it's like, um, artificial cordial.
-Too rosy and too sweet.
-Okay.
[exhales]

*Lizzie*
Quite attractive.
The frying colour looks good.
Mm.
-Hibiscus and what?
-Raspberry liqueur.
The hibiscus flavour's quite nice,
and so's the raspberry.
Overall, it's got a nice structure to it.
It's delicate.
And the toffee,
it's delicious as well.
I would buy these in a shop,
that's for sure.
Thank you. I've been in panic.
You're ruining my lifetime's theory
that you cannot cook if you don't love it.
-[Paul] Well done.
-[Prue] Anyway, well done.

*Lizzie
Lizzie, would you like
to bring out your Showstopper?
Well, it's certainly unusual-looking.
It's very bold. I love the design.
[Paul] I like the fish.
The scales look great.
Let's have a look inside, shall we?
Held together,
and there's the fish going through there.
[Prue] Yeah, little fish.
[Paul] You've nearly got that spot on.
I love that.
Your pastry's too thick,
but I quite like the flavour.
I think it's remarkable
the spinach and the fish
are not overcooked,
because they've been
in there a long time.
Thanks.

*Giuseppe*
It's a really perfect owl, isn't it?
[in high-pitched voice] Ow, don't hurt me!
[Prue chuckles]
[Paul] The design is fantastic.
[Prue] Good pastry.
It's firm enough, erm, but it's crumbly.
The cheese and all the flavours
blends well with the beef.
It looks very professional.
It's very Giuseppe.
[Prue] It's excellent, Giuseppe.

*Chigs*
The pastry, you've cracked it slightly,
handling it out the tin.
Juice was leaking out of there.
[Prue] Looks lovely.
You get apricot, you get gherkin.
I think all the flavours work well.
[Paul] But the design
is pretty uninspiring.
[Chigs chuckles]
That's a big deal for me, that was.

*Jurgen*
[Prue] I love the vine leaves.
Aw, look at that.
-[Paul] I think it's beautiful.
-[Prue] Really beautifully done.
I think the pastry tastes delicious.
But the beef, it's gone very, very dry.
It is a bit too dry,
but you get away with it
because you've got the horseradish.
[Paul] Thank you, Jürgen.

*Amanda*
What happened?
[Amanda] I should have
really got it in the oven earlier
so it had time to cool down.
But when I took out the side of it,
one side came away.
[Paul] Oh, right, okay.
[Prue] That's very good looking.
It's very pretty.
It's bone dry.
Your seasoning is pretty strong.
There's so many things going on
in your mouth you try to identify,
but there's just a mix
of a lot of different things.
But I do like the paté.
For me, the paté is the one thing
that is a bit too strong.
[Paul] Thank you, Amanda.

*George*
It's quite dramatic.
I like the two-tone pastry.
But it's under-baked
and it's collapsed down.
Yeah, I got it in the oven late,
which is unfortunate.
My tray's under there, Paul.
-All right.
-It was too hot to handle.
[Paul] Nice interior.
Hmm.
Mm.
That sausage, mate…
I question whether it's cooked. [chuckles]
I probed it three times, Paul.
-You did?
-Ninety-two in the centre.
Right, okay.
-[Prue] It is a bit mushy.
-It's very mushy, yeah.
It's a pity because the bacon,
that is delicious.
That's a shame, that, George.
Thank you.

*Crystelle*
Such a beautiful cottage.
And I love all the little flowers
and the way you've decorated them
and had time to paint them.
Aw, look at that.
[Paul] Wow.
[Noel] That looks so cool.
The colour layers are lovely.
You've separated them with sweet potato.
-Yeah.
-[Prue] I love that.
Have you seen this here?
No.
Oh, my God!
-Well done.
-[all applauding]
[Paul] That… that curry,
the way you've
broken it down into sections…
And each one, for me, the spice blend,
the hot water crust pastry, the design…
-I absolutely agree.
-Fantastic.
It's brave to make curry pie.
It's a witty, it's charming,
and often, things that are
witty and charming
are not also absolutely delicious.
And you've got the pastry perfectly.
Spot on.
-Really good.
-Well done.
[Crystelle] Thank you so much.


[Matt] We should pay tribute
to these bakers
because the standard has been
so good this week.
Then coming into today,
we were talking about Amanda and Lizzie
in a little bit of trouble,
but the person
who did well out of this was Lizzie,
-because I think she saved herself.
-[Noel] Mm.
To the detriment of George.
George and Amanda
are in a little bit of trouble.
George, today,
I wasn't happy at all with that.
So, Star Baker is…
I think Star Baker is
either Giuseppe or Crystelle.
She really smashed it.
You gave her a handshake.
I know. I don't like giving handshakes.
I know…
-It hurts you, doesn't it?
-It does.
[Paul] Ultimately, that deserved it.
-It was a bit of magic.
-[Paul] It was. Very clever.
But I think Giuseppe
has done really well as well.
It looked amazing.
I loved his meat, though…
[laughing]
Are you talking about Giuseppe's meat?
'Cause I looked down just as I said it.
That's what it was.
-We're all friends here.
-I know.
Well done, bakers, on another week.
It's not easy to find a Star Baker,
but the judges have done it.
This week's Star Baker is…
Crystelle!
[contestants clapping]
Thank you. God.
Oh, that means I've got the horrible job
of announcing the person who's leaving us.
This gets tougher,
it does get tougher every week,
and this has been an amazing week.
But the person who is
leaving us this week is…
Amanda.
-Ah.
-Thank you.
It's okay, you're all right.
-[Noel] Is it all right?
-I knew it was me. You kept looking at me.
[Amanda] I mean, you gotta go sometime,
haven't you?
I didn't think, when I got here,
I'd get that far
after seeing all the other bakers,
but I've had such a good time.
[George] We'll miss you.
You'll be all right.
I'll see you in a few weeks.
[Amanda] You know what?
I came here to have a good time.
It's a little bit stressful here,
but it's a kind of fun stress.
Perhaps if I didn't talk so much
I might've got a bit further.
But I enjoyed it,
so I'm glad I did what I did.
[Crystelle] Oh, God…
I'm in utter shock. My name was going
over and over in my head.
I was preparing myself, and I was just
saying, "George, George, George."
And then they called Amanda
and I could not believe it.
This has given me a big push
to fight for my place.
-That pie…
-[squealing]
[Paul] I don't often give out
handshakes in showstoppers,
but Crystelle deserved it.
It was perfection in my eyes.
-[Chanelle] Hello.
-Hi, Chanelle. Is everyone there?
[Chanelle] Yeah.
I got Star Baker!
[women screaming over phone]
[speaking indistinctly over phone]
-[Chanelle over phone] What do you mean?
-And guys…
Guys, guys, Paul gave me
a handshake in the showstopper.
[women exclaiming
and speaking indistinctly over phone]
[Crystelle] Oh, God.
And people wonder why I'm loud.
[laughs]
[closing theme playing]
