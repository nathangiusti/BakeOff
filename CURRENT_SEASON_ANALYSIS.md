## Performance Analysis

### Top Tier (8.0+ Average)

**Jasmine** (8.05/10, 2 Star Bakers)
- Clear frontrunner with two Star Baker wins in four episodes
- Most recent performance (R4): 9.50/10 - one of the highest single-episode scores possible
- Strongest Star Baker performance in R3 (9.06/10)
- Consistency is exceptional with no scores below 7.0
- Win probability: 15.3% (highest remaining)

**Tom** (7.92/10, 1 Star Baker)
- Strong second place with one Star Baker win
- Recent performance (R4): 8.25/10 - solid high-performing round
- Very consistent across all four episodes
- Win probability: 15.1% (virtually tied with Jasmine)

**Key Insight**: Both top contestants are performing at levels comparable to historical series winners. Jasmine's 8.05 average would rank her among the top 3 winners if she maintains this through the finale (Giuseppe: 7.90, Sophie: 7.58, Peter: 7.56).

### Mid Tier (6.0-7.9 Average)

**Lesley** (6.96/10, 0 Star Bakers)
- Solid mid-tier performer hovering just below the elite threshold
- No Star Baker wins yet, but consistently safe
- Win probability: 13.3%

**Nadia** (6.48/10, 0 Star Bakers)
- Had a strong R2 performance (8.13/10) but hasn't maintained that peak
- Win probability: 12.3%

**Aaron** (6.28/10, 0 Star Bakers)
- Consistent mid-tier performer
- Win probability: 12.0%

**Toby** (5.87/10, 0 Star Bakers)
- Recent improvement with R4 score of 6.83/10
- Win probability: 11.2%

### At Risk (Below 6.0 Average)

**Nataliia** (5.58/10, 1 Star Baker)
- Won Star Baker in R1 with strong 8.27/10 performance
- Had a difficult R2 (3.92/10) that significantly impacted her average
- Win probability: 10.6%
- **Warning**: Despite her Star Baker win, her average puts her at risk

**Iain** (5.39/10, 0 Star Bakers)
- Lowest score among active contestants
- Had a particularly weak R3 (3.15/10)
- Win probability: 10.3%
- **High Risk**: Most likely next elimination candidate based on historical patterns

## Episode-by-Episode Breakdown

### Round 1
**Theme**: [Insert Theme]

**Star Baker**: Nataliia (8.27/10) ✓ *Predicted Correctly*
**Eliminated**: Hassan (3.78/10) ✓ *Predicted Correctly*

**Analysis**: Model performed perfectly in the opening round. Hassan's elimination was expected given his low score, and Nataliia's strong performance earned a deserved Star Baker win.

### Round 2
**Theme**: [Insert Theme]

**Star Baker**: Tom (7.75/10) ✗ *Model Predicted: Nadia (8.13)*
**Eliminated**: Leighton (5.27/10) ✗ *Model Predicted: Nataliia (3.92)*

**Analysis**: This round demonstrated the limitations of pure statistical prediction. While Nadia had the highest score (8.13), Tom received Star Baker. Nataliia survived despite a very weak performance (3.92), while Leighton was eliminated with a mid-tier score. This suggests judges may have factored in overall trajectory or given Nataliia grace for her R1 win.

### Round 3
**Theme**: [Insert Theme]

**Star Baker**: Jasmine (9.06/10) ✓ *Predicted Correctly*
**Eliminated**: Pui Man (4.42/10) ✗ *Model Predicted: Iain (3.15)*

**Analysis**: Jasmine's dominant performance was correctly identified. However, Pui Man was eliminated over Iain despite Iain having the weaker performance. This may indicate accumulation of weak performances across earlier rounds.

### Round 4
**Theme**: [Insert Theme]

**Star Baker**: Jasmine (9.50/10) ✓ *Predicted Correctly*
**Eliminated**: Jessika (2.33/10) ✓ *Predicted Correctly*

**Analysis**: Another dominant round from Jasmine with near-perfect scores across all components. Jessika's elimination was inevitable with such a low performance score. Model predictions were accurate for both outcomes.

## Win Probability Analysis

Win probabilities are calculated as: `(Contestant Avg Strength / Total Remaining Strength) × 100`

### Current Frontrunners

1. **Jasmine** (15.3%) - Strongest candidate with dominant performances
2. **Tom** (15.1%) - Nearly tied for first, very consistent
3. **Lesley** (13.3%) - Solid third place but needs a standout performance

### Key Observations

- **Two-horse race**: Jasmine and Tom are essentially tied for the lead with a combined 30.4% win probability
- **Middle pack compression**: Contestants ranked 3-8 are tightly grouped (10.3% - 13.3%)
- **High variance possible**: With 5+ episodes remaining, contestants in the 6.0-7.0 range could surge with strong performances
- **At-risk zone**: Nataliia and Iain are most vulnerable despite having more episodes to recover

## Historical Comparisons

### Jasmine vs Historical Winners

Jasmine's current 8.05/10 average would rank **2nd among all Series 5-12 winners**:
1. Giuseppe (S9): 7.90/10
2. **Jasmine (S13): 8.05/10** ← Current position
3. Sophie (S5): 7.58/10
4. Peter (S8): 7.56/10

**Note**: This comparison assumes Jasmine maintains her current average. Historical finalists typically see slight variations in final episodes due to increased difficulty.

### Early Star Baker Dominance

- **Jasmine**: 2 Star Bakers in first 4 episodes (50% win rate)
- Historical context: Multiple Star Baker wins early is a strong indicator of series winner potential
  - Giuseppe (S9 winner): 2 Star Bakers total
  - Syabira (S10 winner): 3 Star Bakers total
  - Sophie (S5 winner): 2 Star Bakers total

### Nataliia's Trajectory Warning

Nataliia presents an interesting case study:
- Strong R1 win (8.27/10)
- Catastrophic R2 (3.92/10)
- Current average: 5.58/10

Historical precedent: Contestants who start strong but fall below 6.0 average rarely recover to win. Her Star Baker win may provide temporary judge favorability, but sustained improvement is necessary.

## Predictions

### Most Likely Winner (Top 3)
1. **Jasmine** (15.3%) - Frontrunner with dominant performances
2. **Tom** (15.1%) - Strong challenger, very consistent
3. **Lesley** (13.3%) - Dark horse if she achieves a breakout Star Baker performance

### Next Likely Eliminations
Based on current averages and historical patterns:
1. **Iain** (5.39 avg) - Lowest average among active contestants
2. **Nataliia** (5.58 avg) - Despite Star Baker win, below safety threshold
3. **Toby** (5.87 avg) - Hovering just below 6.0 threshold

### Potential Surprises
- **Nadia**: Had one exceptional round (8.13). If she can return to that form, could surge
- **Aaron**: Consistent at 6.28 but hasn't shown the standout performance needed to challenge the top two

## Statistical Notes

- **Win Probability Calculation**: Probabilities are relative to current remaining contestants only. As contestants are eliminated, probabilities will redistribute.
- **Historical Model**: Based on 603 contestant-rounds from Series 5-12
- **Performance Threshold for Safety**: Historical data shows contestants below 6.0 average face 25.8% elimination rate vs 0.9% for those above 8.0
- **Star Baker Correlation**: High performers (8.0+) have 43.0% win rate for Star Baker per episode

---

## Next Episode Predictions

Based on current trajectory and historical patterns:

**Most Likely Star Baker**: Jasmine or Tom (both performing at elite levels)
**Most Likely Elimination**: Iain (lowest current average, recent weak performance)
**Dark Horse Star Baker**: Lesley (consistent enough to potentially break through)

**To Watch**:
- Can Jasmine maintain her dominant pace?
- Will Tom have a standout Star Baker-worthy performance to challenge Jasmine?
- Can Nataliia recover from her R2 disaster?
- Will Iain improve or face elimination?
