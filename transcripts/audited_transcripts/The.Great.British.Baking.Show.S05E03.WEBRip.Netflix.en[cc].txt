*Kate*
I think they're a bit small.
I think teacakes should be big and flat.
-These are sort of buns.
-[Paul] Good fruit distribution in there.
I think you have slightly over-baked them.
Yeah.
[Paul] I get the blueberry.
I get the cinnamon.
-[Prue] They taste terrific.
-Thank you.
Nice, even buns.

*James*
[Paul] Great texture.
The proving is perfect.
[Prue] And the baking is perfect.
It's got good flavour.
That tastes fantastic.
You just needed that temperature
to be up by 20 degrees,
and you'd have ended up
with the perfect teacake.
-Congratulations.
-Brilliant. Thank you.
Handshake from me. Means nothing.
[exhales]

*Liam*
These two look heavily fruited
and these don't.
They might not be when you open them,
but the truth is, it's better not to have
these outside, because they get
a bit too over-cooked.
My problem is, I don't think it's baked.
-[Prue] Oh, no. No, that's not good.
-It's not baked.

*Flo*
You got any salt in there?
-Yeah, a little bit of salt.
-Not enough. It's bland.
Do you know, I think you could've done
with a bit more fruit in here.
What temperature was your oven?
-160.
-Too low.

*Sophie*
Smells great.
-I actually quite like them.
-Yeah?
Yeah, I do.
The thing it needs, though, is more spice.
Oh, really? Okay.
It just lacks flavour.
But actually, the fruit is lovely.

*Tom*
I think it's clever of you to have rolled
them so that the fruit is really encased.
Never got any fruit in that one.
-Never got any fruit in that one.
-[laughing]
But the flavour of the dough is excellent
and that balances it out,
so by the time you toast it
and put your butter on,
it tastes good. That's the closest thing
I've had to a teacake so far.

*Stacey*
[Paul] I think you've baked it okay.
[exhales]
I honestly think it's a good teacake.
It looks like a teacake,
it feels like a teacake. It's not hard.
I think your choice of milk
was a big problem,
because if you'd had egg on that,
they'd look as they should,
but you got the basic shape.
You have got a decent teacake.

*Julia*
There seems to be
plenty of fruit in there.
I'm certainly getting the fruit
and I'm certainly getting the orange.
Spices? Yeah, I'm getting that, too.
Overall, I think the flavour's good,
distribution's good, the size is okay.
Just slightly under-proved.
Okay.

*Yan*
It's a little doughy, isn't it?
It's the volume of fruit,
and it's added all that moisture to it.
But overall, the flavour is nice,
you know?
It does have a very good flavour.
What else is in the mango?
Cardamom. Cumin. Chili.
It's amazing. There are so many things
going on. Beautiful chutney.
[Yan] Little bit of a kick at the end.
I didn't want to blow your heads off.
Great.
-Very, very good.
-Thank you.
[Prue] Really delicious.

*Steven
They, my friend, are not your finest hour.
They are pretty bad.
It's just over-proved.
You've heated it up
and the whole thing has fallen apart.
[Prue] On the other hand,
your vodka cocktail
looks absolutely wonderful.
You know what? It's absolutely delicious.
Try a bit of vodka butter, Paul,
see if you change your mind.
[laughing]
-They're still over-proved.


*Liam*
[Prue] It's a pity he is like a baby dragon.
I would have liked to see him
really centre stage.
Paul's gonna pull his head off.
I think you've got some strong,
bold flavours. The basil's there.
-It's very good. Tastes just like pesto.
-Great flavour. Wow.
I think we'll try the pumpkin.
It's well-baked. I love the colour.
I'm trying to hunt the flavour.
I'm not getting much.
I get the chilli heat,
but I don't get much else.
Let's try this focaccia.
Garlic.
Strong.
Almost too strong.

*Yan*
It's not very evenly distributed,
the apricots.
The flavour of the apricot is delicious.
-[Paul] What's in this chocolate one?
-[Liam] It's chocolate and date.
Your flavours are fantastic today.
Get in.
But your proving is a little bit under.

*James*
I like the design of the owl.
The hedgehogs, probably not as much.
-This is walnut and raisin, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.
[Prue] Smells good.
Saffron's quite strong.
The walnut and raisin is losing its battle
against the saffron,
which is a real shame.
Remind me what the green is?
It's matcha green tea.
[Prue] Oh, it's matcha. Do you know,
that's too strong for me, too.
I really don't like the flavours, James,
but the design is so bold.
The baking is so good.
The proving is right.
You've got everything right,
-except it doesn't taste nice.

*Stacey*
You know, I think it is so elegantly done.
It's exquisite.
Thank you.
[Paul] I'm gonna take a little cut
of the challah.
While I'm here,
I'll take a little bit of
the lemon and turmeric.
[Prue] Challah is lovely.
Really good.
Taste is all right, but the proving
is wrong. It needed longer.
The strength of that turmeric is
quite overwhelming. The lemon's lost.
I think the design's good.
I think it's been executed well,
but your flavours are wrong.

*Steven*
Wow.
Well, Steven, that is amazing.
[Paul] It does look mighty impressive.
I'm gonna have to destroy that,
this now, you know?
[sighs] It's fine.
[exhales]
I think that's unbelievable.
The delicacy of the crumb,
which is more focaccia-like,
the flavours that you've got
from the Manchego, from the chorizo.
Well done. I mean, that's a big tick.
I've got to find the weak link.
[laughing]
It's delicious.
It's a perfect breadstick. Just curly.
[Paul] Remind me of this one again,
is it peppermint?
Chocolate peppermint breadstick.
[Prue] It's lovely.
[Paul] I mean, wow, wow, wow
on the flavours.
Steven, come here a second.
Come here.
Stand next to Prue.
I'm gonna go sit down here.
[laughing]
That is ridiculous.

*Flo*
Thank you, Flo. Can you tell us all about
your coloured bread sculpture, please?
It's supposed to be Tom Jones'...
Tom Jones? Davy Jones' locker.
I think Tom Jones' locker
would not look like that.
[Flo laughing] Davy Jones' locker.
I think it's very ingenious.
I think it's a little too clumsy
to come off perfectly.
Oh, look at the colour.
There's your three right there.
Squid ink, turmeric and beetroot.
The texture is very good. It's baked well
'cause it's more like a ciabatta.
-Is that what you set out to do?
-No.
You could've lied then, Flo.
I left the door open
and you never walked through.
No.
The paprika's quite strong in there.
This one tastes almost tasteless
because my mouth is still...
burning from the paprika.
Yeah. The paprika is just overwhelming.
[Prue] Not your best, Flo.
No.

*Kate*
I love that octopus.
I love the flavour of squid ink,
so I hope we get to get it.
The squid ink comes through
and it's very suitable for an octopus.
That is very good.
Heavy crust all the way around,
which cracks.
Beautiful and a regular structure inside.
[Prue] Well done.

*Sophie
I do like the basket.
I think the plaiting is very, very good.
I'm looking for the definition
in the colour
and I'm not seeing it too much
at the moment.
The apples don't really
look that green, do they?
The dough's quite underdone.
I think it's only marginally underdone,
and although, of course, the apple inside
has made it a bit wet,
it's still very pleasant to eat.

*Tom*
Well, you've certainly got
your three colours, haven't you?
[Paul] But having said that,
it's about getting
the definition in the rose,
and I think you've lost
some of the definition.
And the definition on the yellow roses
is much better.
[Paul] Much better. Yeah.
[Prue] I mean, that is really
quite exquisite.
-[Paul] This is the, uh...
-[Tom] Beetroot one.
I mean, it has a sort of pink hue,
which what you were going for.
Not much flavour, quite bland.
Which is a shame.

*Julia*
[Paul] I like the snail.
[Sandi] Is there something about the shape
of the snail you particularly like?
[all laughing]
Paul, are you going to
pull yourself together?
Yep. Give me a minute. [clears throat]
[laughing]
[Prue] Well, you certainly have
the three colours, don't you?
In fact, you have four colours.
Beetroot and potato,
oh, just feels so lovely. Look at that.
[Paul] The colour of that is amazing.
Lovely texture.
Nice flavour. I'd like to try this.
[Prue] This is the rye.
Wow. That's packing a punch, isn't it?
This is gonna be fascinating.
[Prue] Good crust.
Very malty.
[Paul] Great texture, great flavour.
[Prue] Really good bread. All right,
now we're going to attack this fellow.
Look at that. It's goat's cheese and...
Caramelized onion.
[Paul] Great taste.
Really fantastic taste.
The goat's cheese in there is delicious.
Your design is very, very good.
Well thought through.
-[Prue] Well done.
-Thank you so much.


What a memorable Showstopper.
Who stood out for you?
Stacey's fallen out of
the possibility of Star Baker.
I don't think that was good enough.
I think Julia's certainly still up there.
Julia's was lovely.
The snail was... humorous.
With the goat's cheese inside
and the onion, it was delicious.
She gave herself a huge job
and she pulled it off.
Obviously, Steven stood out.
That was exceptional.
I mean, every single element
to that was perfection.
The flavour combinations were stunning.
Very, very clever.
Though I'm not sure
we can give him Star Baker
when he did so badly with his teacakes.
Can we talk about Flo's Tom Jones' locker?
[Paul] The paprika burnt your mouth.
Just killed everything.
So much paprika in there.
She's in trouble.
-I think she struggled, Flo.
-What about Liam?
I want to shake Liam
because he keeps doing things wrong,
but he has this brave thing about flavour,
which I love.
Has he saved himself? I don't know.
