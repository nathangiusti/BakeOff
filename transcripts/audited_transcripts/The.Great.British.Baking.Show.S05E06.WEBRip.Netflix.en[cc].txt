Hello, Sophie,
tell us all about your savoury pies.
So I have the four seasons
and the filling
is a roasted butternut squash,
spinach, and blue cheese.
I love this plaiting around the outside.
That is so neat.
So why didn't you leave it in there
a little bit longer
to get that latticework cooked
a little bit more?
Oh, no, that was intentional,
so that's got a milk wash on it.
-Yeah.
-[Paul] And this one?
Oh, maybe that could have done
with a bit longer. [chuckles]
[Prue] Gosh, that looks good.
[Paul] That pastry,
it's crispy all the way through.
I think blind baking
was a definitely a good choice.
I think it helped.
[Prue] And that filling looks perfect.
[Prue] You've got enough sauce in there
to stick it together,
-but not so that it sogs up the pastry.
-Yep.
A little bit of saltiness
coming from the blue cheese.
Blue cheese is such a great flavour,
but it hasn't killed the butternut,
it hasn't killed the spinach.
You've got a really good balance.
[Paul] The whole thing together
is absolutely delicious.
Really good.
You've got the right sauce level as well.
-[Prue] That is a triumph.
-Well, thank you very much.
-That's a proper Prue pat you got there.
-Yeah, no, a Prue pat.
Congratulations.
-Thank you.
-I'll just double check for them as well.
-Yeah.
-Just take that with me.
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thank you.

*Steven*
Nice decoration, and actually
the colours are all fairly even
except for this one. What happened?
Yeah. That was the last one in the oven,
it was just a rush at the very end.
[Prue] Beautifully made.
I think the little hearts around
the edge are absolutely beautifully done.
[Paul] Okay.
-[Steven] Item one.
-[Paul] Nice bake all the way down.
[Prue] Perfect.
That is very good pastry.
I have to say it
doesn't look really pretty.
I mean, there's something
quite upsetting about eating pink mash.
The colour's unfortunate.
It looks a bit like raw pork.
[Prue] But the flavour's good.
The berries with the mash
are the star of the show.
[exhales deeply]

*Julia*
[Paul] Nice bold colour.
[Prue] Yeah.
[Paul] I think you could have done
with a little bit less.
-Okay.
-If I'm honest.
Was it yours that has the, uh,
baking powder in it?
You see, I honestly think that's a mistake
'cause it's made it a tiny bit cakey.
Can't really taste the sausage, mate,
it's just paprika,
that's all you're getting,
really coming through it.
Not your best work,
a little bit disappointed.
Sorry.

*Kate*
I don't think they look good.
-No.
-I think the plaiting is okay,
but you've lost
all the definition on it as well.
-Let's go for... Is that Jesus Christ?
-[Prue] Don't rise to the bait, Kate.
Oh, I won't, no.
It's a bit boring.
I mean, it's perfectly pleasant,
but you don't think, "Oh, that's divine."
And you do have a couple of soggy bottoms.
I've seen you bake
a lot better than this, Kate.
[sighs]

*Yan*
[Prue] The expectations
are tremendously high,
and really it does look a bit of a mess,
and they don't all look
quite evenly baked.
I was struggling for time, so I thought
I'm gonna get at least one pie cooked
'cause I don't want to give you
anything raw to eat.
I think the one we are safest with
is trying this one here, with the colour.
-It's baked at the bottom.
-Ooh!
Your pastry is delicious,
buttery, flaky, I don't think
it's the same on the others.
No.
The chicken is tremendously dry
and over-cooked. The pastry is perfect.
It is pastry week,
just remember that, when you...
Yeah, but, and filling
as well, unfortunately.
And decoration.
And four the same.
-Oh, bum.
-[Paul] But besides that...
-Sorry, am I...
-Thank you.
-Am I allowed to say "bum"?
-Yeah, 'course.

*Liam*
Overall actually, I quite like
the colour of the pies,
one thing I do like is the dome.
I love that classic dome.
Let's have a quick look at this one.
Oh, it is baked.
Okay.
[Prue] Ooh, that looks good.
Very flaky, looks a great filling.
[Prue] Oh, that looks wonderful.
Look at those colours.
That pastry is terrific,
and it's well-seasoned.
[Paul] I think your textures between the
chorizo and the sweet potato is very good,
very buttery, flaky pastry,
and it is baked.
I think it's a bit of a triumph.
-[Liam] Thank you.
-Well done, Liam.
-[Prue] Keep me a bit for lunch.
-100 per cent.

*Stacey*
[Paul] Very clever, very neat.
Like the colour, like your designs,
looks very, very good indeed.
Well baked.
[Prue] It's cooked underneath.
Pastry looks good.
I mean, really well filled.
A mouthful of pastry
and mince is quite gluey in the mouth,
but the flavour's lovely.
Mince can often give out
a lot of moisture,
and actually you've combatted
that quite nicely
'cause it's got
a lovely colour underneath.
And I love that.
That's a nice pie there,
that's very clever.
He's just eating it now, he's just eating.
-Good, it's fine, yeah.
-Reminds me of, reminds me of me nan.
It's like a proper northern pie.
Very well done.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

*Sophie*
Did everything go to plan?
-I will know when you cut it open.
-[laughter]
Takes a long time to get
that even smooth outside,
I mean, it is beautifully done.
[Paul] Well done.
Yes.
To do that much game
and not get any liquid out of there
is very, very good.
I think it's an amazing construction,
and I love all the flavours.
[Paul] The forest fruits cut through that,
that tartness really cuts through,
but it's that pastry,
it's too thick on the side,
and so you've got that raw bit of
hot water crust just running through it.

*Kate*
I think it looks great.
[Prue] Oh, look at that,
doesn't that look perfect?
[Paul] The pastry is thin,
but it's held well.
I think the flavour is lovely,
and I think it looks pretty.
I love that.
-Do you?
-Yeah, absolutely.
Coolness of the mango
with the curry just works.
-Very clever.
-Thank you.

*Stacey*
It does look a bit of a mess.
[Prue] It certainly looks home-made.
It probably should have been
a bit more professional-looking.
One other thing
I kind of have to tell you.
I'm afraid there's a bit of
baking parchment in the bottom.
Like a surprise. [chuckles]
[Paul] No, it's actually
in the pie, isn't it?
-[Stacey] Yeah.
-[Prue] It is actually in the pie, yeah.
[Stacey] When I took it out of the mould
it was falling apart,
so I filled it up really quickly
and the parchment circle
is still in there.
I'm so sorry.
[Paul] I think if you...
If you were having this as a meal
it would work.
You've made a dish which tastes good
and haven't considered
the hot water crust pastry.
Yep.

*Steven*
[Paul] Look how straight those sides are.
It's neat, it's got a lovely colour on it.
[Prue] It looks really moist
and attractive.
[Paul] It does look good.
You know, overall it's a bit bland.
The stuffing and the turkey
almost taste identical.
The Brussels sprouts
are almost immaterial.
It's a bit of a let down on the flavour.

*Yan*
Now, this one was done
inside the tin, is that right?
Yep.
[Paul] I think it looks all right,
the little bit of crimping
looks quite nice as well.
But I'm dying
to see that chequerboard inside.
Okay.
-[Prue] That does look good. Very nice.
-[Paul] Wow!
It's quite stunning,
the pastry is crispy, it's golden,
nice rich flavour to it as well.
All the sausage meats taste different,
and the fruit works with it.
I think it is absolutely wonderful.
Yes.

*Julia*
-Could have been, uh, much neater.
-[Julia] Yeah.
Where the lid meets the sides,
and they look a bit
sad sitting on the top.
Now, you did this in the tin?
Yeah.
I don't think the asparagus works.
It's all been in the oven too long
because the chicken is dry,
and the asparagus is overcooked.
On the other hand,
the pastry is undercooked.

*Liam*
My conscience kicked in,
so I ended up doing it the traditional way
of using outside the cake tin.
Does your conscience have steely blue eyes
and a silver-grey beard?
[laughter]
[Paul] Right.
[Paul] Well, it's holding together
quite nicely.
But the colours are fantastic,
look at them.
[Paul] Considering
it's a quite lean meat, goat,
that is succulent, it's juicy,
with the plantain
it gives you that lovely smoothness to it
and that tropical flavour as well.
But together, it's really nice,
and when you get that fruit,
that salsa as well,
it's spectacular.
It's absolutely wonderful.
Your grandma is a genius.
Get in. Yes, Nan. [laughs]
-What's your grandma's name?
-Cynthia.
Will she come round
to my house and cook this?
Any time.
