*James*
I must say, it looks very pretty.
-[Prue] My mouth's watering.
-[chuckles]
That's not the lightest sponge
I've ever had.
On the other hand, you've got the
orange there, it is nice and marmalade-y.
[Noel] Paddington Bear will be pleased.
It's my pet name for Paul.
[laughs]
It is a little bit dense.
I wouldn't say it's
a great steamed pudding,
but it's a very good steamed pudding.
I'll take that.
-Well done.
-Thank you.

*Julia*
[Prue] Nice custard. Looks good.
The taste of the orange
and treacle together, it works.
Not the lightest sponge,
but it is delicious.

*Sophie*
[Prue] Looks a little stodgy.
[Paul] This is going to be interesting
with the mascarpone cream.
That Tonka taste is very extraordinary
and rather good.
The flavour of the pudding is delicious.
The ginger and the fig
really work together, and the honey.
Still unsure about the Tonka bean.
-I love it. Just too stodgy.
-Yep.

*Steven*
I love the effect of the fruit sort of
falling down and the darkness
hitting the lemon sponge.
I think that really works.
-Looks very good.
-That sponge looks so light.
The blackcurrant is a nice little burst
of acidity.
[Paul] Should be sharp against
the mellow lemon of the sponge.
[Prue] It's really good.
It is a beautiful sponge,
it tastes amazing, it is light.
[laughing]
[all applauding]
-Well done, mate. Well done.
-[Steven] Thank you.

*Kate*
The custard's embarrassing.
[chuckles]
That's not custard,
that's a big mistake.
It's quite powerful
but I don't get the Earl Grey.
You've got Earl Grey fighting
against lemons,
it's gonna lose every day of the week.

*Yan*
It really looks good. It's dramatic.
It's beautifully designed.
[Paul] Held together well.
Nice consistency.
[Prue] That is good mango.
It's beautiful and light.
-[Prue] It's lovely.
-It's absolutely delicious.
-[Prue] Well done.
-Thank you. Oh, my God!
Two handshakes.
-Thank you, Yan.
-Thank you.

*Liam*
I think it's very pretty.
I love the cherries on the top.
Oh, that looks lovely and light.
Very almond-y, proper Bakewell flavour.
[chuckles]
-It's too stodgy.
-Okay.
You probably mixed it too much and the
gluten's got quite powerful.
That's why I couldn't give you
a handshake.
Do you want a Fielding fondle?
[laughing]
Don't leave me hanging.
[both laughing]

*Stacey*
Looks quite attractive,
sponge looks pretty good.
[Prue] Oh, that looks really good.
Nice and light.
Absolutely delicious.
One of my favourite things is
a Bakewell Tart.
You have the texture of a Bakewell Tart
in there, which is very clever.
Cherries' got that sharpness
to it as well.
So overall, it's a very special thing.
It's absolutely delicious.
[gasps]
[chuckles]
-Thank you.

Sophie, please bring up your
ornamental trifle terrine.
It’s wonderful that you’ve got your
pink sausage in the middle.
Yeah.
I like the look of it. I love the colours.
Wow, drops really lovely.
[Prue] Well, that worked.
Beautiful.
The slice is pretty, a very good slice.
And that yuzu really comes through.
That’s absolutely delicious.
-Brilliant.
-[Prue] Really good.
The sponge, the bavarois,
the mousse, the jelly.
I think altogether you created something
very pretty, very high class.
Terribly delicious.

*Yan*
Amazing, isn’t it?
I actually love it. And she’s got
the gelatine to create the poppy.
It’s very clever.
The strawberry mousse is a triumph.
But who doesn’t like strawberry mousse?
The custard. I think you’ve got
a little bit too much gelatine in there.
It’s just set on the wrong side of firm
but it looks incredible.
Thank you.

*Stacey*
[Prue] Well, it’s certainly jolly.
The pink is proper pink, isn’t it?
Yeah.
[Prue] Well, the slice is pretty,
isn’t it?
[Paul] Yeah.
This is spot on.
The lime, the mint, the chilli.
Who would have a chilli in a trifle?
But it works, that little heat at the end
is fascinating.
The biscuit down the bottom is delicious,
meringues around the outside,
again, genius.
I think you’ve come up with something
that’s truly unique and tastes beautiful.

*Kate*
It’s neat, it’s clean,
there’s stark lines.
The difference in colour is phenomenal.
The jelly is very nice and tart
and really raspberry.
It’s delicious. The custard takes
me back a few years.
I used a bit of custard powder.
Me Nan used to do something
very similar to that.
It’s very good.

*James*
[Prue] Does look a bit firm.
It’s too firm on all of it.
White chocolate is very sweet.
The best bit is the prosecco jelly
on the top.
All the other layers
are not carrying much flavour.
It’s a bit sickly.

*Julia*
Overall, I think the appearance
is all right actually.
I’m fascinated to see
what it’s like inside.
Don’t think the jelly works,
funnily enough,
although I love passion fruit.
It almost tastes watery.
The passion fruit isn’t
strong enough for me.
The texture and everything is okay.
That soggy sponge though I just don’t get.
It’s a shame.

*Steven*
Oh, look at that.
[clapping]
[Noel] Wow!
[Prue] Isn’t that fantastic?
It’s very clever.
[Prue] The stars are amazing.
[Prue] Hmm.
The coconut flavour’s lovely.
It’s a little tough.
Hmm, disappointing.
I don’t like rubber
and it is,
it’s too much gelatine in there.
I think you’ve gone for appearance
rather than textures.
It's not good.
It's a shame, cos it looks amazing.
Everyone’s had a style over substance
at least once.

*Liam*
I think it’s a bit clumsy
and the jelly’s not set..
Yeah, I... Yeah.
[Paul] Wow! It’s like water
that jelly, innit?
It’s just...
I do get the chai.
Chai latte, panna cotta is delicious.
Chocolate brownie is quite tough
and your jelly is a disaster.
[exhales]


Right, who’s vying for the top place?
I thought Sophie’s was delicious.
If you walked into a Michelin starred
restaurant and had that,
you wouldn’t argue it.
It’s absolutely superb.
[Sandi] What about Stacey?
[Paul] Very clever.
Every layer was good.
She’s definitely a contender.
What about Kate, has she saved herself?
I think she has saved herself. It’s not
the first time that Kate’s done that.
The whole thing together as one
when you eat it is absolutely delicious
and actually quite elegant too.
The one who I wanted to weep for
is Liam.
It’s all too clumsy.
I sort of weep for him as well.
He can do better than that.
He knows that as well.
The other one
who I think is in trouble is James.
Fantastic jelly, problem for me
is every other element was wrong.
Julia’s was really disappointing.
She had a passion fruit jelly
with very little flavour.
Julia, yeah she’s, erm,
put herself into a bit of trouble.
Well, you’ve got a lot to decide.
Meanwhile, we’ll just
double-check that this is a...
-Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-You know...
Right, bakers,
I get the best job of the week
cos I get to announce the Star Baker.
The Star Baker this week is the baker
whose terrine
the four of us have literally just
finished off cos it was so delicious.
The Star Baker is Sophie.
[all clapping]
Which means that I’ve got the horrible job
of revealing who’s leaving us.
The person that
we have to say goodbye to is...
James.
I’m sorry, mate.
I’m sorry.
That's all right.
[sobbing]
Thanks, Paul.
-I’m all for you, buddy.
-Yeah.
My time has come.
It’s gutting.
I wanted to do this to put myself against
other really good bakers
to see how good I was.
To be part of that’s been
really humbling.
[Prue] We will miss James in the tent. 
Julia was sobbing her eyes out
and who was comforting her? 
Don’t get me going. I’m not crying.
And that’s typical of James.
He’s just such a nice guy.
Oh, thank you very much.
That was delicious.
It was the Showstopper.
Sophie stepped up to the plate
and produced one of those bakes
that you just wanna go back for again
and again and again and again.
Yes, Star Baker.
I will try and enjoy the moment
before I start thinking about next week.
But, yeah, I’m really chuffed.
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
It was really important that
I did well yesterday, cos if I didn’t...
All I need to do next week is just
pick myself back up 
and just keep on going upwards.
That’s how I’m gonna do it.
That’s the plan. That’s the plan.
