*Dave*
You've done well with the feathering.
Three colours is quite difficult.
-[Paul] Good snap.
-[Noel] Massive snap.
You have the snap. Flavour's good.
You can taste the nuts and mango.
It all works.
Sesame seed, too, which I love.
I just think
you needed more texture in there.
Yeah.
I love the dark chocolate.
It's a nice biscuit.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Good.

*Mark*
Looks a little bit lumpy. Too lumpy.
Yes, I remember worrying a bit
about your very large nuts.
-Mainly because…
-[all laughing]
[Paul groans]
Right.
It snaps, though.
The white chocolate is quite dominant.
It needed something else.
Maybe a bit more fruit in there.
-Could be better.
-Okay.
Thank you.

*Laura*
-That's a pretty classic Florentine.
-[Laura] Yeah.
[Prue] Snaps quite well.
-I love that for flavours.
-Yes!
I think the issue is
you want something bitter.
If you'd kept it to dark chocolate,
you would've been on a winner.
But otherwise, that's a great Florentine.
-Thank you.
-Great, thank you.

*Rowan*
[Paul] Have you practised these?
-Yes.
-Have you done them in the time?
-No.
-Right.
Do you remember what we said last week?
-Entirely.
-So my question is why did you do it?
-Course I have.
-Because I like them.
[Prue] Anyway, it certainly does not snap.
-No.
-I love the flavours of it.
-It's not baked enough.
-The idea of the waistcoats, I love.
But, honestly, that modelling chocolate
ruins the biscuit.
-[Rowan] Okay.
-[Prue] It's so sweet.
Great flavours. Again, simplify things
to get it done in time.
He's a dreamer. Don't stop dreaming.
-But thank you anyway.
-[Prue laughing]

*Sura*
[Prue] They look so sweet,
like little boats.
[Paul] Looks amazing.
Mmm!
The crunch from the nuts is gorgeous.
You get a bit of saffron in there as well.
You've created a beautiful,
well-balanced Florentine.
It's lovely.
The only problem is we asked for a…
-Snap. Yeah.
-[Prue] Snap.
-And what's the tea?
-[Sura] Cardamom tea.
-[Paul] That's delicious.
-[Prue] Lovely.
-Can I take it with me?
-Thank you so much.

*Peter*
You've got the colour
of a sticky-toffee pudding.
-[Peter] Yeah.
-Smells like one, too.
[Paul] Ooh, bit of a bend.
The flavour's delicious.
I've never had anything like it.
Particularly like that white chocolate.
I love that caramel flavour.
You're clever with your ideas.
You've come up with something
that's truly unique. Thank you.

*Hermine*
[Paul] They're a bit scruffy.
Time wasn't on my side.
[Prue grunting]
-[laughs]
-You needed slightly longer in the oven.
There's something tough in there.
Is it the mango?
Probably, yes.
Hmm.
-It's like leather.
-Oh, God, this is agonising.
The mango needs to be soaked
'cause it's just too chewy.
-But love the flavour of it.
-Thank you.

*Marc*
[Prue] It's very pretty
and neat as anything.
Unique. Unusual to use the ruby chocolate.
-Yeah.
-I do like the uniformity.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] It isn't going to snap, though.
[Marc] Yeah.
[Paul] Ruby chocolate's quite tart
and blends well with ginger.
You've got a nice flavour.
I love the sour cherries. Very surprising,
very original and very delicious.
-Brilliant. I'll take that.
-[Prue] Well done.

*Linda*
I think you've lost in the appearance
what a Florentine is.
You should be able
to see much more texture.
You're not getting that,
it's flat as a pancake.
[Prue] I bet it tastes nice.
And it has a snap.
[Paul] Ginger tastes strong, which I like.
It's like having, erm, ginger brandy snap.
It's a delicious biscuit,
but it is not a Florentine.
-Okay.
-[Paul] Thank you, Linda.

*Mak*
What's the decoration?
Supposed to be, er,
a sort of, of a peacock effect.
Peacock? Thought it was a tennis racquet
to celebrate Wimbledon.
Yes, it was.
[Paul laughs]
[Prue] They're gooey.
Could've stayed in there
another five minutes.
-You soaked your mango, didn't you?
-Yeah.
I imagine that contributed
to a sort of sogginess.
I like the flavours,
but it's not a Florentine.
Never mind. Thank you, Mak.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

*Lottie*
I have to say, I think they look good.
Thank you.
You've got a good tempered chocolate,
and I like the top, classic Florentine.
You've got a nice shine, it's busy,
and that's what a Florentine
should look like.
Bit of a snap.
It's chocolatey, it's nutty.
Love the sour cherry.
It's delicious.
The ginger and the cherry
with the dark chocolate is just fantastic.
And it does snap, it's nice and thin.
Can't find fault with them, really.
[Lottie gasps]
-Well done.
-Thank you.
I'll take that one with me. Thank you.

*Rowan*
Rowan, would you like
to bring up your showstopper?
I'm calling this
Worse Things Happen at Sea.
[all laughing]
-We did get your flashing lighthouse.
-You get the flashing lighthouse.
[Paul] It looks like a lighthouse.
It does look a bit smaller than
a lighthouse.
-[laughing]
-[Paul] Little bit.
-[Matt] Yeah.
-[Prue] Is this gingerbread?
It's all a lemon…
Biscuit.
Lovely flavour.
[Paul] That's been worked so much.
-[Prue] Too thick.
-Tastes like rubber, it's a shame.
'Cause the flavour's not bad.
[Prue] I feel it's not your best, Rowan.
I know you can do more.
It's a bit disappointing.

*Marc*
-[Matt] Hmm.
-[Paul] It looks brilliant.
The toast, the rack, the knife,
the way that you've done the buttercream
and that, looks great.
Thank you very much.
Because it's thick, which it needed to be
for the middle of the toast,
-it's squishy in the middle.
-Okay.
-[Prue] But I like that.
-Overall,
-you've done an amazing job.
-Thank you.

*Hermine*
[Paul] They're a bit clumsy,
but they're all uniform
and I like the colour on the outside.
It's beautiful.
It looks as if you sprayed it on.
Thank you.
I'm not convinced on the flavour.
It's all quite bitter, isn't it?
See, it's gotta taste good
as well as look good.

*Laura*
Underneath this is a stand
which you've just put this on the top of.
I'm not convinced
that that's had a lot of work in it.
-Lovely flavour.
-[Paul] The flavour of the biscuit's nice.
It's got a kick to it from the spices,
but in four hours,
I'd wanted something a little bit neater.

*Linda*
[Prue] You've certainly made it
very pretty.
It really is extremely well done.
The biscuit has been worked
a little bit too much.
The texture's not quite there.
It was always gonna be an issue
with shortbread,
but I think the design is very pretty.

*Mark*
-[Prue] It certainly looks very African.
-Scruffy, but it looks the part.
[coughs] Love it.
[laughing]
-Strong, innit?
-[Prue] It's lovely.
-Very strong coffee flavour.
-I like that flavour, don't you?
-[Prue] Hmm.
-[Paul] Never had anything like it before.
You'll be awake all night, Paul.

*Dave*
I love the colours.
-It's so Mexican. It's beautiful.
-Yeah.
[Paul] That is remarkable.
We were looking for form
and shaping and moulding,
-You've done an amazing job.
-Thank you.
It's very believable.
That is lovely.
Thank you.
-Mmm.
-That's actually delicious, yeah.
Overall, you've done a really good job.
Thank you.

*Mak*
We were looking for moulding,
you've gone flat.
I know that the teapot's not moulded,
but I like the look of it.
That looks a bit bendy.
I like the flavour.
[Paul] Not much ginger.
It's not a bad flavour, though.
I just think
the whole thing's a bit clumsy.
You needed more care, to be more precise.
-Thank you, Mak.
-[Mak] Thank you.

*Sura*
[Paul] It looks rushed to me.
You're normally very neat.
That's not neat.
-It's just the icing that is rushed.
-I agree.
Great flavour, though. Great snap.
-[Sura] Thank you.
-Really crispy. Delicious.
-Hmm. Very good.
-Really nice.
-[Prue] Thank you.
-Thank you.

*Peter*
I like that. It looks very neat.
It's quite effective.
-[Prue] So that's the cranachan.
-Mmm-hmm.
The mixture of oatmeal,
whisky, raspberries…
Honey and cream.
-Mmm. It's delic…
-[chuckles]
You couldn't finish the word delicious,
it was so delicious.
-[Noel] Prue's in ecstasy. [chuckles]
-[Prue] It's very witty.
And actually, the biscuit's beautiful.
It's well baked, it's tasty.
-I think you've done a great job.
-Thank you very much.

*Lottie*
[Prue] It's very impressive.
I think the boat's there,
it's a shame you ran out of time
'cause it's gone all over the place,
but you've moulded it nicely.
Erm, the plate looks a bit rough.
It is Viking, it's been under the ground
for the last 500 years or something.
Thanks, Prue.
[Prue] It's good gingerbread.
Very crisp, lovely flavour,
lots of ginger.
It has got a nice flavour to it.
-Overall, you've done a decent job.
-Very good.


[Matt] It's decision time
for Prue and Paul.
Who'll be named Star Baker
and who will leave the tent?
So who do you think did the best
in that last challenge?
-[Paul] David's was very good.
-Absolutely lovely.
I adored it and then I liked…
-[Noel] Mark R.
-…Mark.
-His Ethiopian tea set.
-[Matt] Marc E had a really good week.
-I really loved that.
-Very clever.
The texture, the look, it's very neat.
-[Matt] Hmm.
-So the Marks…
Top marks for the Marks.
[laughing]
[Paul] We've got a few people in the mix
-for Star Baker.
-[Matt] Hmm.
But when it comes to who's going home,
it's difficult between Mak and Rowan.
Which of those two do you think is
the most likely to improve if they stay?
Well, I have to say Rowan
doesn't seem to take any advice.
Paul has been saying to him,
"Try not to promise too much."
"And, for goodness' sake, finish."
[chuckling] He hasn't done it once yet.
You just want his execution to be better
-because he has great ideas.
-I know.
On the other hand, Mak is steady, good…
-But he's not blowing your mind.
-Yeah.
I sense that you're torn.
We'd better leave you
to make your decision.
