*David*
-[Prue] Hello, David.
-[David] Hello.
[Paul] Hi, David.
[Paul] I think the plaiting
and the shaping look very, very good.
Very good.
Could-- Couple of minutes less, perhaps.
It's just gone a little bit dark there.
[David] Hmm.
[Paul] I don't think they're bad
at all. The shapes are amazing.
[Prue] They look really good, I think.
Nice texture, though.
It's, erm, springy, soft cake.
[Paul] Hmm.
[Prue] I love the flavour of saffron,
it's really good with the sugar on top.
[Paul] That's a well-baked dough.
The structure's good,
the flavour is fantastic.
It just needs that...
a few extra little bits of fruit in there.
-Very good, though. I'm impressed.
-Well done.

*Michael*
[Prue] They are a bit uneven,
aren't they?
Yeah.
[Paul] They will be slightly misshapen
because of the volume of fruit
in there as well,
because you get one with more fruit in it,
it can't grow as much as one that has got
less fruit in. Let's have a look.
[Prue] But they're lovely and shiny.
I like the glaze.
Yeah, the glaze looks good.
Decoration's nice.
It's a little tough, actually.
But I think your flavour is spot-on.
The spices are nicely warming
and balance with the fruit.
-Oh, that's good.
-[Paul] It's very good.
It does taste like figgy pudding.
It's really delicious.

*Steph*
Well, I do think they look very shiny
and very attractive,
and my mouth's watering.
[Paul] They smell amazing,
don't they?
Let's have a look.
The fruit distribution's in there actually
and we didn't see it down the middle,
but you can actually see it properly
in two halves,
when you cut it down the middle.
-The texture's perfect.
-[Prue] The texture's lovely.
Yeah, and they're sticky, you know,
you can feel it on the fingers.
[Prue] It's not too much spice
and it's not too little.
[Paul] Hmm.
-Well done. Well done, Steph.
-Well done, Steph.
[Paul] They're nice
hot cross buns, them.
-[Prue] Well done, Steph.
-[Noel] Yes, well played.

*Alice*
[Paul] I think they all look
similar to each other.
There's a bit more
of a difference in the colours.
[Alice] Hmm.
[Paul] Even side to side.
[Prue] Wow. Well, you've got
your blueberries in the middle.
[Paul] Yeah.
[Prue] Nice texture.
Did you candy the lemon peel?
[Alice] Yes. Took me quite a while.
[Prue] Yeah, it needed a bit more.
[Paul] Quite bitter, isn't it?
The lemon in there.
The sweetness hasn't come out in it.
I also think the lemon curd glaze
is not as attractive
because it's not shiny enough.
Hmm.
[Paul] I think you baked them well,
I just think there's a pretty
irregular colour going on in there.
-[Alice] Hmm.
-[Paul] And size.
Well, they look homemade.

*Rosie*
[Prue] They're lovely colour.
[Paul] They look great.
Highly decorative.
I mean, they'd look great
in a shop window, those.
The buns themselves look a bit flattish.
You can see they're sitting quite squat.
I think you've got pretty consistent
on the colour.
And there's a bit of raspberry jam.
[Paul] They're a nice flavour.
I'm...
-I look at that crumb...
-[Rosie] Hmm?
Now, this is where you've dug it out
and you've put this in.
-[Rosie] Yeah.
-See how quite, er,
dense it is down there? Open?
I did have to do it when it was quite hot,
so I was sort of cutting them and then
pressing down with the fork when it was...
So it... Yeah, it's condensed the...
-[Rosie] ...a bit hot, yeah.
-...dough down at the bottom.
[Prue] It's really pleasant.
It's like, erm, sort of almost
doughnut texture, it's nice.
[Paul] I think you've done
a great job.
I think they do look very, very smart.
Thank you very much indeed, Rosie.
-[Prue] Well done, Rosie.
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Lovely.
-[Prue] Excellent.

*Henry*
I think you've got a pretty stable colour,
you know,
you have irregularities there in the size.
Little bit, yeah.
-Nice idea, though.
-But they really look interesting.
If I saw them in a bakery window,
I'd want to try one.
Hmm, okay.
[Prue] It is delicious.
Oh, thank God.
[Paul] So, I think your flavours
are good.
The proving's good, the bake's good,
the colour's good, the technique's good.
[Prue] Flavour's lovely.
[Paul] Yeah, my only gripe
is the, erm, the size difference.
But nevertheless...
N-- Shut up.
[Paul] Well done, Henry.
[Prue] I don't think
you say "shut up" to the judge.
[Henry] I'm so sorry, sorry.
[Noel] No one's ever told
a handshake to shut up.
-That has made my month.
-[Paul] That was good.

*Steph*
Steph, would you like to bring up
your Showstopper, please?
[Paul] The blocks that you've rotated
needed more filling in between
because there's big gaps there
which shouldn't be there.
You almost wanna grout round it.
-Yeah.
-Just makes it neater, you know.
I agree about the little gaps,
but the pattern is very Sarawakian
and I think it looks lovely.
-The sponges are delicious. They're soft.
-They're very good.
I have to tell you,
the marzipan is brilliant.
-Just delicious.
-The decoration's good as well.
-I think you've done a good job.
-Very good, Steph.
-Thank you, Steph.
-Thank you.

*Rosie*
I think it looks a bit messy.
-[Rosie] Yeah.
-[Paul] It's not neat at all.
Erm, you can see the colours,
they're vibrant enough,
but I just wanna see what it's like inside
when we cut it.
[Prue] That is a very complicated
pattern to attempt.
That's got quite a tasty flavour, that.
What is the jam inside?
[Rosie] It's nectarine jam.
[Paul] You can't identify it,
you know it's there.
-Gives it a little zing, you know?
-It's very nice, the taste.
[Paul] The idea's sound enough
it just hasn't been executed
to a better level
to really shine off
what you've actually done
'cause there's a lot of work there.

*Michael*
It's a shame you didn't add
a little bit more colour
into the top and bottom layers
because that bottom layer there
looks quite raw, rubbery.
I drizzled rum between the layers,
so it has got a bit of moisture in it.
-[Paul] Oh, did you?
-Yeah.
There are layers,
but because they're all the same colour,
or almost exactly the same colour
it looks just like one solid slab.
It is a little stodgy.
Very claggy, very stodgy in the mouth.
I think the soaking
was probably a bad idea.
It's almost like all one now,
and a very dense piece.
So, when you eat it, it's a bit rubbery.
Overall, it looks wonderful.
It's just a pity about the texture.
Okay.
-Thanks, Michael.
-Thank you, Michael.

*Henry*
What's this?
-[Henry] Just cake.
-[Paul] Another cake.
[Henry] There's a lot of cake there.
-It's all cake. Yeah.
-[Prue] It's all cake.
Well, I think that's really clever.
Looks like a stack of egg sandwiches
in an afternoon tea.
That's what I was going for, yeah.
[Paul] Is that what you were going for?
-Shut up.
-[all laughing]
Henry, I think that is
a really nice textured cake.
It's not stodgy,
the lemon and lime comes through,
it's really nice.
[Paul] Actually, I'm quite impressed.
-It's not perfect.
-No.
But it's been executed pretty well,
and actually, you do get a nice flavour
in the mouth and nice texture,
certainly not rubbery.
It breaks apart like a cake would.
Even though it's cut
into so many different pieces.
I actually think you've done
a pretty good job.

*David*
Well, I'll tell you, my first impression
is that it's architecturally
very interesting,
and I love the shape of it
and everything else.
My next is that it is very small.
I mean, this was
supposed to be for a party,
a big cake for a lot of people.
-Is this for Sandi's family?
-[all laughing]
Sylvanians still have to eat, you know.
There's meant to be more,
but I had an issue with some of my layers.
I lost quite a bit.
[Paul] The lines that
you've managed to achieve
and the colour definitions that
you've got here are pretty good.
Nice and spicy.
Think it could be a bit sweeter, really.
[Paul] It's a little bit rubbery.
It's perfectly edible
if you had a piece like this.
You couldn't eat much more than that,
but I quite like the flavour
and I love the neatness of it.
I think it's very neat.
[Prue] Just think the whole thing
is not quite sweet enough.
If you eat a tiny little bit of icing
with it, it's great.

*Alice*
I think it's extremely neat.
The detail in it is incredible.
The way you've gone to all this trouble
to get this pattern going,
and then the lines on the top
are beautiful.
The painting, the decorations
of the fireworks look good.
It looks a bit dry,
and that's my only concern at the moment.
The layers are so thin
and they're so small,
your little blocks or strips,
that it almost looks like weaving.
That is pretty clever, isn't it?
[Paul] That is very, very good.
-Is there almond in there as well?
-[Alice] Yeah.
-[Paul] Tastes like marzipan.
-[Prue] Mmm.
That works really well.
The marzipan gives it that petit four...
almost texture, flavour in your mouth.
I think the detail in there
is exceptional.
It's fine, vibrant, and very artistic.
-Very good.
-[Prue] I think it really works.
-Well done.
-Thank you very much.


It's really, really close, I think.
-[Noel] Well, that was pretty good.
-I thought it was fantastic.
[Paul] Rosie's was a bit messy.
I think she's put herself down
into a spot of trouble.
She was so ambitious, I mean
the way she cut her cakes was
much more complicated and difficult
and she didn't succeed.
It's a pity.
I thought Michael's was quite neat,
but you weren't
as impressed with it, were you?
Michael's chief problem was
there were lots of layers in that
but they all run together
'cause they're squished, aren't they?
Just blends in with the marzipan,
doesn't it?
Erm, I think point in question is,
when you look at David's,
look how neat that is.
It's a shame they're very small
and they were a bit rubbery.
I liked the decoration with cake on cake
that Henry did.
-[Prue] Oh, I loved it.
[Paul] The taste of Henry's was very good.
You get that lime and lemon,
perfect combination.
The colours balanced up
beautifully as well.
As was Steph's, I mean she had a problem
with the filler on that one
but you can see every single line,
every single colour in there as well.
I think Alice has done a great job
on this challenge, actually.
'Cause now she was in terrible trouble
coming in to the Showstopper.
-[Paul] Yeah.
-[Prue] Oh, she must have saved herself
surely, that was such a good cake.
Who might be in line for Star Baker?
For me, I think Rosie and Mike
are in a little bit of trouble.
And I think Alice has saved herself.
And I think any one
of the other three could be Star Baker
and that includes Henry, Steph,
possibly David.
Hello, bakers. I’ve got the fantastic job
of announcing who's won Star Baker.
And the person who's won Star Baker
this week is...
Henry.
-[clapping]
-[David laughs] Well done.
Shut up.
[all laughing]
So, this leaves me with the horrible job,
and it gets so hard now.
I’m afraid the person
who is leaving us is...
Michael.
-I’m so sorry.
-It's okay. It's okay.
It was my time, it's okay. It’s okay.
[Michael] I feel okay.
My head is held high and I am so happy
and so proud... and so tired. [laughs]
I’m going out laughing,
and that’s brilliant.
It’s totally fine.
Don’t worry. Don’t worry.
I wish I was a pretty crier
you know, like in black-and-white
French films when it’s raining.
But instead, I’m like... crying ‘cause
I couldn’t make a kek lapis Sarawak.
[Paul] It’s pretty sad, Michael going.
He did okay, but overall,
the standard this week has got better,
and I think from now on in,
we’re gonna see
a different standard of baking.
[Henry] That went well.
That’s my tick list now.
I don’t actually need to do any more.
I've ticked everything off.
[Noel] Alice has made me cry now.
[Michael] Oh, no.
I’m just gutted, erm,
that Michael’s left, yeah.
He’s just been so supportive,
I don’t think I’d have got this far,
to be honest, without Michael.
I’m so glad to be going through.
I can’t quite believe it.
I think it’s gonna
take a while to sink in,
kind of week eight of the Bake Off. What?
