*Peter*
[Paul] I like the overall look of it,
it's neat.
[Prue] I love the polka dots.
Love the texture of the chocolate one.
It's both crumbly and moist
which is quite difficult to get.
Nice thin marzipan.
The chocolate's got
a lovely flavour to it. Decadent.
It's the same with the orange.
Gluten-free flour
for sponges really does work.
-It's great.
-[Prue] Delicious.
-Well done.
-Thank you.

*Mak*
[Prue] It's very neat, isn't it?
Good orange flavour.
I just question the ginger with the orange
and then on the outside, the pistachio.
It's too complicated.
The almond marzipan
would have been better than the pistachio.

*Hermine*
-[Prue] That looks striking.
-[Paul] The decoration's neat.
The marmalade brings bitterness
to the marzipan.
It blends the orange
and the chocolate together,
-so it's never gonna be too sweet.
-It really is a pleasure to eat it.
-Aw, that means a lot. Thank you.
-[Paul] Good job.

*Laura*
The one thing you expect
from a Battenberg is incredible neatness.
You've got no distinction
in the colours of the sponge.
But your flowers look sweet.
I'm getting a plain sponge
and the raspberry.
-Okay.
-And that's pretty much it.

*Dave*
[Prue] Really nice square edges.
The coffee overpowers the chocolate.
-It's delicious.
-[Paul] You can't really get the booze.
It's a beautiful coffee
and vanilla Battenberg.
I think you explained it wrong.

*Linda*
It's lacking identity.
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-[Paul] He's just unfinished.
-[Linda] Yes.
-[Paul] Oh, we have the St George flag.
-It's over-baked. It's bone dry.
-Yeah.
[Prue] I wish we could give you marks
-for your handsome cousin.
-[Linda] He's lovely.

*Loriea*
-[Prue] Very striking.
-[Paul] I can smell the bubble gum.
-[Matt] About to say…
-So can I. [chuckles]
That's a good thing.
I'm rolling it round
to try and blow a bubble.
I reckon if I did it long enough,
I probably could. That's bone dry.
The flavours are intense.
I love bubble gum, I like cream soda,
it just needed to be
a little bit less heavy.
And it's really thick, the marzipan.

*Mark*
[Prue] It's a nice light sponge.
It's a little thick,
but I like the marzipan.
Pomegranates don't do anything
flavour-wise.
There's pistachio in the green sponge,
-that brings a lovely texture to it.
-Thank you.

*Marc*
[Paul] If Fanny Cradock
was gonna do a Battenberg…
-[both] That would be it.
-Is that a compliment?
-[Marc] I know…
-[Prue] I think it's a bit too busy.
-Good strong sour cherry. Lovely.
-[Paul] Fantastic.
-There's too much rose water.
-Okay.

*Lottie*
-Shall I open it for you?
-[Paul] Please.
[Prue] I like it wrapped up.
Oh, I love your stripes.
-[Paul] The starburst.
-Yeah.
It's a little bit messy.
Was it warm when you were doing it?
Yeah.
The colours are really wonderful.
I like the cake.
They both taste the same,
is that meant to…
-Er, yes?
-[Prue and Lottie laughing]
The yellow is supposed be a custard.
[Prue] They both taste delicious,
and the same.
The rhubarb jam
that you've made is nice and strong.
And there's enough acidity in it
to cut the sweetness.
It's a good effort.
-I'm struggling not to eat more.
-[Matt] Mmm.
-Do you want to finish?
-I'll stay here
-and eat.
-Please do.
They'll judge everyone else.

*Rowan*
I had to change the design
at the very last minute.
-So no temple, then?
-It's a deconstructed temple.
[Paul] I think the night sky
looks quite effective.
[Prue] Yes. And actually, it's quite neat.
I can tell by the way
the knife goes through
that that's quite a heavy sponge.
-It's a bit hard work for cake.
-[Rowan] Okay.
[chuckles]
There's moisture in there
that still needs to get out.
Okay.

*Sura*
-That looks really pretty.
-Thank you.
[Paul] I like the decoration.
I like that you've glazed it, too,
'cause that, again, sets it off.
[Prue] The flavours are there.
The texture is very good. It's very neat.
I like the marzipan.
Individual elements are good,
-including the buttercream.
-It's a lovely piece of cake.
Thank you so much.

*Rowan*
Rowan, would you like
to bring up your showstopper?
The choux buns were a bit
of a disaster, so I had to improvise.
[Paul] There's a pattern here.
'Cause you promised us almost
a Parthenon yesterday, we didn't get.
-Promised us choux buns, we haven't got.
-No.
Say less and then do more.
-Yes.
-[Paul] Having said that,
you instantly recognise who it is.
I think it's absolutely brilliant.
-[Rowan] Thank you.
-I hope she tastes nice.
Well, so do I.
-Gonna go through her cheek.
-Yeah.
No.
Oh, you brute.
[chuckles]
[Rowan] It's a chocolate cake
with kirsch-soaked cherries.
Mmm! Cherry flavour's lovely.
Would've been nice to have the choux buns,
but overall I think you made a tasty cake.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done, Rowan.

*Lottie*
[Prue] Well, I have to say,
he is recognisable.
-Definitely.
-Thank you.
That sort of slightly
anxious look is very Louis Theroux.
It is a coconut and lime sponge
with a chocolate orange buttercream.
[Paul] You get all the flavours,
the orange, lime, coconut.
But it's over-baked, bone dry.

*Mak*
[Prue] It's obviously Bill Bryson.
It's good. I love the detail on it.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] And what's inside it?
It's a lemon Madeira with red currant jam.
-Lovely flavour, but it's very dry.
-[Paul] And that's a real shame.

*Linda*
I'd like to have seen a mouth on it.
'Cause Marley was known for his voice
and he hasn't got a mouth.
-[all laugh]
-I know.
-I think it's delicious.
-[Prue] It is.
[Paul] It's got all elements
of a good sponge.
You can't go wrong
with citrus flavours and a lemon curd.

*Peter*
It's very dramatic.
He's got wonderful athlete's shoulders.
He really looks as if he's puffing.
And I love the helmet.
[Paul] It's clever, and a good get out,
because, wearing a helmet
and a mask, you know who it is.
I mean, Sir Chris has got
many, many Olympic medals.
That's what he wore when he did it.
-It's excellent.
-Let me just…
Sorry, Chris.
[Prue] I was worried about this.
I thought Victoria sandwich
and fresh cream is all
quite light and easily squashed,
and you'd end up with a pudding inside.
But you haven't. It looks lovely.
The Italian meringue
buttercream is delicious.
The strawberries,
the cream, the sponge is spot on.
It feels really fresh. Light.
It's delicious. The concept is great.
And it's witty.
-[Prue and Paul] Well done, Peter.
-Thank you so much.

*Dave*
[Prue] I think it's like a caricature.
So it's really good.
-[Dave] Thank you.
-[Prue] Would you tell us what's inside?
Mint and strawberry
with a cocoa buttercream.
Bit toothpaste-y.
The mint is so strong.
And it has that very chemical taste.
[Paul] It's a shame.
Let yourself down
on the texture and flavour.

*Marc*
Yeah, okay.
Erm, that's about as far away
from David Bowie as you could get.
-I'd agree with you.
-[Prue] Yes, he's lost his neck.
Yeah, more Jabba the Hutt.
[judges laugh]
[Marc] It's a chocolate sponge
with vanilla buttercream.
[Prue] It's quite dense.
[Paul] Slightly over-baked.
Okay.
-But it's a great flavour. Good effort.
-Thank you.

*Hermine*
The fact that you put "Guess who?" on this
must mean
you don't think it looks like her.
-That's right.
-[Prue chuckles]
Your work with the fondant
is absolutely exquisite.
[Paul] I thought it was real.
[Prue] So let's hope
it's as good inside as it is outside.
I hope so.
It's really lovely.
It's such a rich chocolate cake.
It's delicious.
I'll sit down
and have a slice of that anytime.

*Mark*
[Paul] You can see who it is.
-[Prue] It looks great.
-[Mark] Thank you.
It is a ginger spice sponge
with a coconut buttercream.
Lovely, very good flavour.
[Paul] It's nice to see
you haven't overdone it with spices.
You've got spices you can identify.
But it marries beautifully
with the ginger.
It's a well-baked cake.
-[Prue] Well done.
-Thank you.

*Loriea*
We've got a picture
of her in front of us now.
Head scarf, tick.
[Prue and Paul] Necklace, tick.
-Resemblance to her, doesn't exist.
-Resemblance, not so much.
[Paul chuckles]
Erm, it has got a chilli chocolate sponge
flavoured with Scotch bonnet chilli powder
and ginger and mango jam.
Chilli's a bit overwhelming.
[Prue] I agree
that you could lower chilli a little.
-Wow.
-[Matt chuckles]
It's coming in waves.
But when you've got
a wave of ginger as well,
it's really, really strong.
Now, this is lining up
with what happened yesterday, as well.
Consistency is the word.
You are consistent. Absolutely.

*Sura*
He's reclining.
He's having a nap.
[Matt chuckles]
[Paul] Very neat on the shirt,
very neat on the face.
Well, you can see who it is.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Gosh, that looks really tender.
[Sura] It is a coconut sponge
with a raspberry
Italian meringue buttercream.
[Prue] I like the flavour.
[Paul] It's not dry, which is good.
It's nice and moist.
Overall, you've done
something that looks like him.
It's quite smart, it's neat.
You've done a good job.
Thank you.

*Laura*
[chuckles] Sorry.
[chuckles] You're not supposed to laugh.
It was all going really well.
His jacket looked great and everything.
And then the head exploded.
I think, erm, but, I'm hoping
that the flavours will redeem.
-[Paul] What are they?
-[Laura] Lemon and elderflower.
I do think his jacket is lovely.
-[Laura] Thank you.
-[Paul] Yeah.
Mmm, that is delicious.
Thank you!
I think one of the reasons it squashed
so easily is it is very moist.
-[Paul] Hmm.
-[Laura] Do you like it?
-[Paul] Erm…
-Oh, go on, say you like it.
-Actually, I love it, yeah.
-Yes!
[Paul] The flavour's good.
The elderflower's there.
It looks the way it does,
but it tastes really nice.
And you can identify who it is.
Thank you.
-[Matt and Noel] Well done.
-What a relief.
Come on, Fred.
-Let's go.
-[all laugh]
-Well done.
-Thank you.


[Noel] Paul and Prue
have made their decision.
Well, congratulations, bakers.
I have the rather pleasant job
of announcing this week's Star Baker.
And this week's star baker is…
Peter!
[all applaud]
Go, Peter.
Which means I've got the horrible job
of announcing which baker is leaving us.
And the baker who's going home is…
Loriea. I'm sorry.
[all] Aww.
-Oh, darling, I'm so sorry.
-[Loriea] It's fine.
-[Linda] Bless you.
-[Loriea] Thank you.
It might have been nice
to stay a bit longer,
but someone has to go, so…
-You did amazing, remember that.
-Thank you.
Yes, I am proud.
I did quite well to get here.
And I stayed true to myself.
-[Paul] I'm so sorry.
-[Loriea] It's fine.
It was really sad, 'cause
I could see a lot of talent in Loriea.
And what was…
As a judge, I can't get involved.
'Cause I wanted to tell her,
"Stop doing that".
And it came down
to over-baking and over-flavouring.
[Marc] Can't believe
I'm through to next week.
I was sat on that chair,
ready to stand up.
Ah! [laughs]
Oh, my gosh.
Aw, fantastic. I can't believe it,
I was like… [screams]
-Thank you.
-[Rowan] Well deserved.
I said I was putting
my money on you. [chuckles]
-[Peter] Hey.
-[woman] Hi, Peter.
Just wanted to give you a quick call.
Erm, so, week one
went pretty well. I got Star Baker.
-[woman cheering over phone]
-[chuckles]
[woman] Hurray! Well done!
Thank you, it was, erm, pretty insane.
[chuckles]
