-Hi, Jon.
-Hello.
Right, Jon.
[Paul] It's a very concise little cake.
The little balls on the top
look quite good.
[Prue] Nicely executed.
-That's his family you're just mutilating.
-[laughing]
It's a little claggy. A little too...
[clicks tongue]
But the flavour, when you do hit
one of the little lemon gels
is beautiful because you've got
a lovely blend between the two.
[Prue] And they were surprising,
I've never had those little
lemon goldy balls.
-They're so good.
-Ah, cheers.

*Karen*
It's quite a hard cake that.
I put some, erm...
-Oh, Karen.
-No?
[Paul] Too much booze.
[Prue] Too much booze.
Too much booze.
I've never heard Prue say too boozy.
I know. I never thought
I'd hear me say that either.
-Well thank you...
-[Paul] Thank you, Karen.
...for your appraisal of that.

*Ruby*
The colours are beautiful.
They look very pretty.
The drizzle looks great as well.
-You get the rum.
-Yeah.
-[Prue] It's delicious.
-Good.
[Paul] The rum is
an overwhelming flavour,
-but it ain't no ginger cake for sure.
-Oh, really?

*Rahul*
-[Paul] I think it looks amazing.
-Thank you.
[Paul] Your pipework is very good.
[Prue] It's very pleasing to look at.
It's lovely.
Mmm.
Lovely and gingery. Good texture.
[crunching]
You my friend are a little genius,
aren't ya?
Because you surprise me every week.
Every week,
the sponge is perfect.
The stem ginger is awesome.
[Prue] I mean,
I have never liked honeycomb.
With ginger in it, it's lovely.
You are one hell of a baker. Well done.
[Rahul] Thank you.

*Briony*
[Paul] It looks quite impressive.
It's a lovely looking cake.
[Prue] Nice shiny chocolate.
[Prue] It's very dry.
[Briony] Oh...
It didn't taste very gingery
or very sweet.
[Paul] The apricot tends to overwhelm it.
To be honest, apricot and the ginger
together doesn't necessarily work.
Okay.

*Terry*
[Paul] It looks a mess.
I think it is down to
the temperature of the cake.
Interesting texture.
[Prue] It's very gluey.
And the ginger's not overwhelming either.
It's definitely a winter one
with loads of custard for sure.
Which ironically is what it looks like.
[laughing] Yeah, it is.

*Kim-Joy*
[Paul] The gingerbread house
looks incredible.
The attention to detail looks fantastic.
That is the most beautiful textured cake.
-Ah.
-[Paul] The flavour
from the ginger in the powder
is beautifully balanced
and it's got a nice warmth
that comes through.
That is, erm...
It's, erm...
[Paul] ...beautiful.
-Ah. Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done, Kim.
[bakers clapping]
[Kim-Joy] Got such sweaty hands.
[chuckles]
-Thank you so much. Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done Kim-Joy. Wonderful.

*Dan*
Obviously, there's
an issue to the lean.
[Dan] Yep.
[Prue] Leaning tower of ginger.
[Paul] But I think it comes down to timing
because the sponge is probably
still too warm.
It's gone more and more condensed.
So as you start at the top it's lighter,
slightly less so, slightly more dense...
[Prue] And very.
[Paul] ...and then dense.
It's such a pity because being too warm
when you were putting it together
has affected everything.

*Manon*
[Paul] Very elegant looking cake.
[Prue] Very elegant.
And a little touch of chocolate.
-Again, you blowtorched it.
-[Prue] Nicely done.
Ooh, it got a bit all together.
[Paul] Such a rich colour in there.
Mmm...
Certainly, get the ginger and the lemon.
It's so beautiful how soft the sponge is.
And because the lemon curd is so strong,
-the Italian meringue makes it less so.
-Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, it's one of the best ginger cakes
I've had for some time.
-[gasps] Yay! [chuckling]
-[all clapping]
Thank you. Can I have one Prue, too?
That actually reminds me of my nan's cake,
which is full of ginger,
but it's the bake. It's so good.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Great job, Manon.

Manon, please will you
bring up your showstopper.
Ah, this is a delicate business.
[Noel] What could go wrong?
-[Paul] I think it looks amazing.
-Thank you.
I think the detailing
round the top is very good,
but what's impressive is the fact that
you've given it all the same shade
all the way down.
Now the chequerboard effect...
Did you build it all up
and then chop it--
Yes... Ooh.
[all laugh]
And then--
[Sandi] Oh. Wow, we're under attack.
It's all about the spice for me,
and I'm not getting much in the way of
massive amounts of flavour,
which I would have expected.
But as the biscuit goes and the design,
it's very, very impressive.

*Dan*
[Paul] The pattern
on the butterflies is exquisite.
But what does it taste like?
I don't get any cinnamon in that biscuit.
All the flavour comes from the icing,
which is almost a synthetic flavour
that I'm getting.

*Ruby*
[Ruby] They were meant to be sandwiched,
but unfortunately with the heat,
as you suggested, it wouldn't stay.
Pistachio's lost,
but the cardamom in there is delicious
and it's a beautifully baked biscuit.
Thank you.

[Sandi] Rahul, please bring up
your chandelier.
[Noel] Don't drop that, please.
I think what you've done is, is beautiful.
I think the colours are amazing.
You've got the sugar work inside there
as well, which is fantastic.
It's a bit messy in places.
It's almost like time was
against you all the way.
How many biscuits did you make?
A hundred and fifty?
The flavour of that cardamom,
the way it melts in the mouth,
the butter in the biscuit is beautiful.
You've even got
that little bit of blossom,
that little hint at the back as well.
It's a fantastic biscuit.
You need to pull something back
'cause it's nearly there.
It's just a little bit messy in places.

*Karen*
The biscuits look solid, you know, chunky.
-We're big girls in Pontefract.
-[all laugh]
Still are. Sorry.
What's weird is the liquorice
and cardamom together tastes like ginger.
Liquorice is one of those flavours that
has to be quite pure to come through.

*Briony*
I'm curious about the texture
of this biscuit.
It's almost got a skin on the top of it.
[Briony] Yeah, it's kinda cracked, yeah.
Yeah. I've never seen anything like it.
Oh, okay. Well I hope you like it.
Mixed spice, a little bit of clove,
turmeric...
[exhales] Possibly.
It is unusual. I've never had
a biscuit like that before.
Okay.


Kim-Joy, would you like to
bring up your spiced biscuit chandelier.
Well, that is exquisite.
-Aww.
-Your piping is phenomenal.
I mean, these little biscuits
down the bottom.
I mean, look at the detail on that.
It's absolutely gorgeous.
I love the little icicles
with the isomalt as well.
Very, very clever.
Thank you.
The spices you've got in there
really work together.
It's the classic Christmas combination.
Have you got a little bit of
nutmeg in there as well?
Yes, oh, yeah, nutmeg.
It's got a lovely warmth to it.
That is very, very well thought through.
Thank you so much.

*Terry*
Did you finish it?
-Did you get everything done?
-No. No.
[Paul] The biscuits, look quite dark,
some of them.
This tree at the bottom looks a bit...
-Black.
-Yeah.
Run by the flavours again for me?
Er, cinnamon, mixed all spice
and black pepper.
[Paul chomping]
-It's quite bland.
-Really?
Considering what you put in there,
all the spices and the pepper,
I expected it to be full of flavour
and it just isn't.
Hmm.
The maids here are
a slightly different biscuit.
-Not getting it again.
-No?
I think the idea was very good
and you got a lot of the detail on there,
but I think you took on far too much.
Yeah.

*Jon*
Jon, would you like to bring up
your biscuit chandelier please.
-It's a bit messy.
-It is very.
It feels like it needs finishing off.
As far as the flavour goes,
cinnamon is the king there.
I mean, it is like a shortbread,
such a delicate, buttery biscuit.
If I was blindfolded and ate that,
it would have been fantastic.
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.
-Cheers.
-[Sandi] Thanks, Jon.

Right, my lovely bakers,
nothing left for you to do
while Paul has to decide
who is the star baker
and who are the two people
who are going to be leaving us this week.
[Briony] That's like, nine down to seven.
It's just such a big jump, you know.
I'd like to think that I did well,
but yeah, I don't know.
Paul's very diplomatic,
a gentleman, I think.
Very kind actually.
[Jon] I can bake better than that.
Hopefully with the flavours
in my biscuits,
it'll keep me through to week six
'cause that's all I'm hoping for
at the moment.
[Karen] Clearly, I'm one of them.
I am going home.
Of course.
[quacking]
You've lost your double act partner.
How was it for you?
I missed Prue, actually, today.
I missed her. There's too
much testosterone at this table.
-What, from you and Paul?
-Yeah.
[Paul and Sandi chuckle]
So the showstopper, has that
shifted things dramatically?
I think when it comes to star baker...
I think, Rahul is in the running.
Again, his biscuit...
Unbelievable...
I mean, it melted in the mouth.
You have to put Kim-Joy
in the mix for star baker
because that showstopper was superb.
Karen and Terry were struggling
a little bit coming into the showstopper.
Still struggling?
[Paul] There was no real
spice coming through.
[Sandi] Briony did quite well.
[Paul] Yeah.
[Sandi] Has she saved herself?
[Paul] It was a strange one.
She used a lot of
different spices, didn't she?
She did and I think,
probably if I'm honest, too many.
I will put Jon in there as well.
It was a bit all over the place
and sort of a bit messy.
As Prue's not here,
did you want our help
'cause we... We can absolutely
help you make your decision?
-No.
-[Sandi] Okay.
That's a no. I think that's a no.
Is that a no?
Well, well done, bakers. That's the end
of the very first ever spice week
and what a fragrant success
you made of it.
This week I have the great job
of announcing
star baker and it was quite tight.
But the star baker this week is
-Kim-Joy.
-[bakers cheering]
That's so good. Well done.
So proud of you.
So I get the rotten job I'm afraid.
It's a really unusual week,
we are sending home two people.
And the two people
who will be leaving the tent...
Are Karen and Terry.
Oh, well. That's all right. No problem.
-[Ruby] Sorry, love.
-That's all right.
[sighs]
[Sandi] It was great.
You got halfway through.
What a crazy, crazy few weeks
I've had here. [exhales]
Yeah.
-Outside of having your family...
-[Noel] It's not right you're going.
...as a personal achievement,
nothing will ever top this,
I don't think, obviously.
-You've done really well, mate.
-Well, no, you're a gentleman.
[sniffles] I said I wouldn't get upset.
Erm...
It's funny when you're on your own...
Thank you, Dan. Good luck.
My wife and I were very happy,
and that was a massive loss,
and there wasn't anything that filled
that void for a long time.
So, it did give me a focus.
-I shall miss you.
-Gonna miss you. I'll miss you.
Thank you so much.
-[Terry] I've met some lovely people.
-It's all right.
I'm sure we'll keep in touch
for a long time.
Yeah, it's been a big help...
[clears throat] Sorry.
It's been a big help
and, erm...
One I'll remember for a long time.
-I'm gonna miss you.
-Ah! I'll miss you too.
[Terry] I won't stop baking.
I'm very much looking forward to
more adventurous projects
carried out in a bigger time-frame.
No baking for a bit.
I'm going away in the caravan.
Well done, Kim-Joy.
You did well. You did well.
I'm so happy.
I was hoping, hoping, hoping
and it happened,
and I'm over the moon.
It's not the week
that I expect it to happen,
spice week, when my flavours
have been a bit... Mmm...
But it makes me feel like
I've learnt things.
It's so nice but then I feel like,
"Oh, maybe, the pressure's on
for next week
and I'm gonna have to practice a lot."
