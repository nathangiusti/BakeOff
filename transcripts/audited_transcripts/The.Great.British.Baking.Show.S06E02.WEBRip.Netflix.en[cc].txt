 -Hello, Rahul.
-Hi.
They are quite elegant and it reminds me
of an afternoon tea
in a five-star hotel 'cause they look like
they're finger sandwiches.
-Oh.
-[Prue] Let's have a taste.
You certainly get the lemon
and the cardamom
and they're in the right proportion.
I think that's very good.
For something that looks
like a wholemeal finger sandwich,
they taste beautiful.
Sigh of relief.
-Yeah.
-Thank you.
Cheers. Thanks.

*Manon*
[Prue] It's quite a tough sponge.
[Paul] And it's a bit bland as well.
Okay.

*Antony*
[Prue] You really have got the balance
of the coconut and the frangipane
absolutely perfect.
It's very delicate.
Not as powerful as I thought it'd be.
It is a little bit of a mess...
-Thanks, Paul.
-...but I think it's a pretty decent
traybake.

*Luke*
Tough as old boots.
And the top is very sloppy
so you've got sloppy and tough.
[Sandi] Sounds like a terrible double act,
Sloppy and Tough.

*Terry*
You were right about the rum.
It's very rummy.
[Paul] Because the amount of apple
that you've put in there,
it brings flavour.
Blending that with the raisin, the rum,
I think you have a beautiful,
traditional traybake.
Not very sophisticated
but a real pleasure to eat.
[mouths] Thank you.

*Karen*
[Paul] I think they look very elegant.
-You have kept it simple
-Yes.
but it is down to that sponge.
I think the marzipan's a bit too thick
for that amount of sponge.
[Paul] The sponge is very dry.
That's a shame
'cause they look great.
Thank you very much for your
feedback. That's great.

*Kim-Joy*
[Prue] They look really elegant.
They look all the same size.
Very neat. Oh, lovely colour.
I love that pale green.
That comes from the pandan leaf,
doesn't it?
Yeah.
I love the chiffon. That is lovely.
Textures are perfect.
The look of it is perfect.
-But I just don't like the pandan.
-No, I accept that.
Some people don't.
[Paul] For me it's not the right flavour
to go in a traybake
but I admire the fact that you did it
because that chiffon's perfect.

*Briony*
I really hope they taste okay.
-So do I, um, 'cause they look hideous.
-[laughing]
[Briony] I know! I know. I'm sorry.
-[Prue] It's divine.
-Is it? Oh.
There you go.
Honestly, I don't care the way it looks.
-Really?
-Yeah.
I have to have another bite.
The almonds in there, the turron as well.
The whole thing together.
The orange. It's delicious.
-Absolutely lovely.
-Oh, thank you.
Can't believe I'm crying over a traybake.
[all laughing]

*Jon*
Well, I have to say
they look very elegant.
Thank you.
I'm not quite sure I'd like a whole
piece of rosemary leaf in my mouth.
Right.
[Prue] But you've got chopped rosemary
inside, haven't you?
Yes, yes.
[Prue] I'll tell you what, it's delicious
when you do get a bit of rosemary.
The Italian meringue, it tastes fine,
it just needed more whipping.
Chocolate goes well with it as well.
Sponge is good but it's down
to those little elegant touches
and I think you lost it slightly
with the Italian meringue.
Thank you.

*Ruby*
It looks like a forest floor.
[gasps] Okay.
[Paul] It's a mess. It's broken apart
as you've tried to portion this
'cause some are thin, some are thick.
I think as a chocolate cake goes
it's fantastic.
-[Ruby] Yeah.
-I mean very, very good.
The biggest issue is that
you don't get any cherry.
Right, okay.
[Paul] Maybe more kirsch in there
would have helped as well.
[Prue] Oh, I'm not sure about the kirsch
but I could eat that
with a great deal of pleasure though.
Oh, good. Phew.

*Dan*
Well, the decoration
is absolutely excellent.
Everything is very neat.
You pipe very well.
It's not too thick. Impressive.
Thank you.
[Paul] I think they look amazing.
Good interior.
Mmm. Nice and boozy.
Come on. Say something nice.
-Like your T-shirt.
-Just doing my best here.
That'll do.
Oh, wow.
[all applauding]
Thank you very much.
What I like about it,
it looks incredible.
But when you get inside and you do hit
that cherry and the kirsch
sits there and then the topping,
it's just a really nice cake.
I could sit and eat the whole lot.


Dan, would you like to bring
your Showstopper up please.
[Prue] I'm really impressed
because with this heat to get a collar
round it at all is an event.
[Paul] I think you've done an amazing job
and the stripes are beautiful.
[Prue] Well, that's beautiful.
It's rich and moist. It's delicious.
The Swiss meringue with the raspberries
is bringing a tartness,
married with the chocolate and the collar,
that's mighty impressive. Well done, Dan.
Thank you.

*Kim Joy*
[Prue] I'm really impressed
with the cats. They make you smile.
Better taste as good as it looks.
The sponge is quite firm.
It is slightly too dry.

*Antony*
[Paul] It looks fantastic.
I do, I do like the colours.
-Wow.
-[Prue] Wow.
[Prue] The colours are just amazing.
I'm not getting pistachio.
There is no pistachio
to blend with the saffron.
It's just saffron in my mouth,
so it tastes almost savoury.

*Karen*
[Paul] I think it looks amazing.
I love the piping.
The sheen you've got
on the chocolate is very good.
The collar's very neat.
That is really lovely chocolate cake.
It melts in the mouth, which is perfect.
Fair play to you. That's a great job.
Well, that's great to hear.
Thank you so much.
I can't fault it.

*Jon*
It's simple and highly effective.
You've got a great sheen
on that chocolate.
[Prue] I think it looks amazing.
It is tender. The pineapple
has made it very moist.
I think the sponge is fantastically baked
and the coconut really
works with it as well.
[Prue] And I really love your design.
Very good.
-[Paul] Well done.
-Thank you very much. Cheers.


Luke, would you like to bring
up your Showstopper please.
Not really. [laughs]
Sorry about that.
-Cream in this sort of heat...
-Yeah.
White chocolate in this sort of heat...
-Let's see what it tastes like.
-It might taste wonderful.
[exhales]
The flavour is delicious
but the cake is tough.
I'll eat the raspberries
and cream all day,
especially with the white chocolate.
-Your sponge isn't good.
-Is it not good?

*Manon*
[Paul] It's a nice-looking sponge.
What's going on?
Why wasn't this taken off?
[Manon] Basically,
my chocolate didn't set.
Well, it's set now.
And now it's off, this chocolate
is beautifully tempered
and absolutely shining.
[Paul] Okay.
[Prue] That's a very nice sponge.
I think it's a very, very nice cake.
Very smart.
-Thank you.
-That's a shame
you didn't take the acetate off. [laughs]

*Terry*
Well, I have to say, I think the way
you've done the iron work is brilliant.
It may only be half the Eiffel Tower
but everybody knows what it is.
-Yes.
-Okay.
What I'm mostly getting is the sweetness
of the buttercream
and the cake is a bit boring.
[inhales sharply]
-Bad luck, Terry.
-No problem.
-Thank you, Terry.
-You're welcome.

*Briony*
-We only asked you for two tiers.
-[Briony] Yes. I know. I know.
-So you did get collar round two.
-Yes.
[Paul] We'll have a look at your
sponge now.
[Paul chuckles]
Oh, look at that. That is very beautiful.
Thank you.
Your sponge is over-baked.
You can see by the colour on the outside,
how dark that is
and the others are like rubber.
I agree with you that the texture
of the cakes are not right
but I think the flavours are lovely.
Okay. Thank you.

*Rahul*
Wow. It's a wonderful construction.
I'm really impressed that you managed
to keep it together
and it hasn't all fallen down.
[Paul] Based on the weather today
and the heat,
I think you've done an unbelievable job.
Not just to do two collars
but to do these little pipework
across the top as well
and then do the shards on top of that.
-I'm impressed, Rahul.
-Thank you.
You can hear that crack. It's beautiful.
[Paul] Very bold, strong colours.
Fantastic.
Rahul, can you come here a minute please?
[inhales sharply]
Ah!
I've never given a handshake
for a Showstopper before.
Thank you.
That is a fantastic cake.
Well done, Rahul.
[Prue] Well done, Rahul.

*Ruby*
It really is very elegant
and very restrained.
-Thank you.
-It's classy.
I can just tell by the way
you're cutting it
that the sponge is beautifully cooked.
I can sit here eating this
for an hour or so.
Oh. Phew.
-[Prue] It's just delicious.
-Thank you.
Come here, Ruby.
Ah, yes! Yes! Yes!
Woo.
That cake. That sponge.
The flavour in there.
The hazelnut and the chocolate.
Every element comes through.
Perfectly.
The collar is so elegant.
The brittle on the top.
That's a fine cake.
Oh, thank you. Oh, I'm made up.
