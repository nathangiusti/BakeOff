*Peter*
[Paul] They look attractive on the top.
[Prue] They really look lovely.
It's got the chewiness,
but it's coming from the dates,
-isn't it?
-Mmm.
-What spices did you put in there?
-Cinnamon.
I think there's too much cinnamon
because the cinnamon
has overtaken the chocolate.
It's different. It's risky.
It's okay.
-[inhales]
-[Noel] That is brutal.
-Thank you.
-[Peter] Thank you.
[softly] It's okay.
It's a bit disappointing.

*Larua*
Hmm, it looks as if they came out
of the oven too early.
[Paul] Yeah, it does look a mess.
Let's have a look, shall we?
-[Prue] That's too much Italian meringue.
-Okay.
It's too sweet.
Really?
-[Paul] Far too sweet.
-Okay.
'Cause you've got caramel,
you've got the meringue on the top,
you've got the chocolate.
You go, "Enough now."
-It's underbaked.
-[Laura] Mmm.
[Prue] A few problems here.

*Sura*
-We need to get them out of there.
-[Sura] Yeah. I had two trays of brownies
and one of them actually fell inside
the oven, so I've just presented one.
-[Prue] Very tough.
-[Sura] Hmm.
[Paul] I don't like the flavours.
I do. What is it?
Dark chocolate and, er, ruby chocolate.
'Cause I'm getting a sort of citrusy kick,
but that must be the ruby chocolate.
-[Sura] Yeah.
-[Paul] Hmm.
[Prue] But the bake's not right,
and obviously, you haven't got enough.
-[chuckles]
-[Sura] Yeah.
-[Paul] Not your best work.
-No.

*Mark*
Okay, well, they look, er, neat.
And they look pretty identical.
So, I've got a cookie base
with a dark-chocolate brownie
with Italian meringue
and some sugared cranberries.
[Prue] It tastes like a brownie.
I'm slightly avoiding the top
because I know that'll be very sweet,
but overall, I think
it's a really good job.
Thank you.
The biscuit base is too thick.
I like your flavour.
I just think your textures were wrong.
Okay. Thank you.

*Hermine*
[Paul] They're a bit messy.
I like the raspberry acidity,
but the white chocolate is just too much.
[Paul] A lot going on in there.
You've got coffee, chocolate,
raspberry, pista…
[Prue] You've got a lot of sugar.

*Linda*
[Paul] It's sponge-like
rather than brownie-like.
See? Looks like a chocolate sponge.
I like the flavour.
It's unusual, it's nice.
It came down to the bake itself.
-Okay, thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you.

*Dave*
[Paul] They're all pretty even.
Yeah.
It's overbaked. It's more like
a sponge than a brownie.
-Tastes great. I like the flavour.
-Yeah.
It lacks the two things
that I think make a brownie,
that is the gooey middle
-and the crackly top.
-[Dave] Yeah.
-You made a good traybake.

*Marc*
-They don't look good.
-No.
I was running out of time basically,
so it was a rush at the end there,
so I apologise for that.
-[Prue] It's quite dry.
-Okay.
If you go right to the middle,
it's nice and squidgy.
I think the flavours are okay.
-It does look a mess.
-[Marc] I know, I'm ashamed of it.
That's a problem. Brownies
are one of the most basic things to bake.
If you can't get that right…

*Lottie*
-[Prue] They don't look great.
-[Paul] They look a right mess.
-Like they've been dropped.
-Yeah.
[Noel chuckles]
[Lottie chuckling]
Have you got a straw?
Not on me. Would you like a spoon?
[Prue] Hmm.
I love the, erm,
sharpness of the raspberries.
But there is too much cheesecake mixture.
Sort of overpowers it.
The flavour's okay.
-Textures are all wrong. Looks terrible.
-[Lottie] Yeah.
-Besides that, brilliant.
-Nailed it.
-[Prue chuckles]
-Thanks, guys.


*Mark*
I love the way it looks.
-Thank you.
-[Prue] It looks original.
-It looks modern. I'd buy that.
-[Mark] Thank you.
It's a great-looking cake.
Naked element of it looks nice,
it's neat and I love
the drips are all equal.
And so I've got white-chocolate cake
with pistachio and lemon genoise
and then a white-chocolate sponge
with a marula fruit liqueur
and white-chocolate
Italian-meringue buttercream.
All the flavours are there
but they're quite delicate.
-Okay.
-It needs more of a hero flavour.
I don't think pistachio's
gonna be strong enough.
[Prue] It's a beautifully made cake.
-The flavour just needs a bit more oomph.
-Bit more oomph. Okay.

*Lottie*
I love that. It's very cool.
I like what you've done with the sapphire.
I think it's imaginative,
I think it's exciting.
-It's beautiful, well done.
-Thank you.
It is three white-chocolate sponges
with a passionfruit curd
and a lime kind of syrup.
The flavour's good, textures aren't there.
It's overbaked.
-Mmm-hmm.
-So it is bone dry inside.
Yeah.

*Sura*
I actually think the work
on the chocolate looks fine.
My issue is…
-[Sura] It's leaning.
-The shape.
I mean,
-they're all over the place.
-They are.
[Prue] Hmm.
[Paul] You have raw dough.
[Prue] Looks like marzipan.
Your recipe was at fault
or you've weighed something up wrong.
Could've been the white chocolate
with the water.
Yeah, maybe.
Such a pity. It's not edible.

*Dave*
-It looks wonderful.
-Thank you.
The colour of the sponge worries me.
-It's very dark.
-Okay.
[Paul] Let's have a look inside.
Well, I don't think it's overbaked.
It does taste really good.
-Strawberries work well with it.
-Thank you.
I don't like the colour of the sponge,
but it's a decent cake.
-Thank you. Cool, thank you.
-I love it.

*Linda*
I really like it. Buttery,
white chocolate, bit of zest in there.
My issue is the decoration.
The piping work is not good.
-Oh.
-[Paul] At any level.
I think Paul is right.
It's a really delicious cake,
a little dense, piping not perfect.
-No.
-[Prue] But thank you.

*Marc*
-[Prue] It's neat.
-[Paul] It's a great-looking cake.
Very pastel.
-Yeah.
-[Paul] Let's have a look, shall we?
-Sponge is a little dense.
-Okay.
-It's weighed heavy on that.
-Yeah.
But I like the flavour
and the raspberry through it.
I think you've done a good job.
-And it tastes of white chocolate.
-Good.
-Well done, thank you.
-Thank you.

*Peter*
[Paul] The collar is beautiful and smooth.
And all the way round,
it just looks really neat.
It's a coconut cake
with mango-curd cream in the centre.
Oh, that'll be a chocolate chunk.
It's like toffee,
it's gluing my teeth together.
I think it's well baked.
Coconut flavour really comes through.
Mango lightens it up.
You've come up with something
that is very neat.
-Clever. Well done. Thank you.
-Thanks.

*Hermine*
It's a little bit messy
down at the bottom.
Top bit's cute, quite like that.
-Just don't seem to go together.
-They don't.
It's like two different cakes.
-Mmm, delicious. Delicious.
-[Matt chuckles]
So, we call it a "Prue-gasm."
-[all laugh]
-[Matt moans]
[Paul] The lemon works beautifully
with the sponge.
It's got that citrus kick you want.
Well done, Hermine, it's just delicious.
Thank you very much.

*Laura*
Sometimes less is more…
that's sort of let it down a little bit.
Okay.
Blackcurrant is beautiful.
I can't really get the white chocolate,
but since there's so much
white chocolate everywhere else,
perhaps that doesn't matter.
[Paul] Your sponges
are dried out slightly.
-You slightly overbaked it.
-Okay.
-But I love the blackcurrant.
-Thank you.
Works beautifully
with the white chocolate.
You put a lot of thought into it.
-Well, well done, Laura.
-Thank you.

So, kids, that was a tough week.
But we should talk first
about who could be Star Baker.
I think Peter, again, Mr Consistent.
Very clever, very neat,
the colour was good.
I liked the mango, as well.
[Prue] Can I talk about Mark L,
because I think his cake
was just beautiful.
He's been up there constantly, Mark L.
He was third in technical,
did well in signature
and he's done pretty good today.
So I think I would put
one of those two in line for Star Baker.
Who's in trouble?
Sura, I think.
Based on her showstopper being raw,
she made a big mistake with that.
-And probably Lottie.
-She was bottom in the technical.
Didn't do fantastically in the signature.
She did well in the showstopper
but has she done enough
to stay in the competition
and did Sura really fail that much
that she has to go?
I really like Lottie and Sura,
so I will go instead of them if you want.
-I'd be happy.
-Yes, we'll have that.
-See you, mate.
-[Noel laughs] Prue!
Thought I was your favourite.
See how easily they forget
once the new kid's in town.
The novelty of me will wear off.
I wouldn't get rid of him.
[laughs]
[Noel] Hello, bakers.
I've got the great job
of announcing Star Baker.
So the Star Baker is…
-Mark L.
-Oh, thank you.
-Ooh.
-[all clapping]
-Thank you, thanks.
-Smashed it.
[Hermine] Well done.
So it's up to me to announce
who is going home
and it is someone
who we're all really fond of,
but who had a bad week.
And so the baker who will be leaving us
this week is…
Sura.
-I was expecting that.
-[kisses]
You are honestly amazing. You're so good.
[Paul] Never mind. You're a good baker.
I'm gutted, but what's done is done.
I'm not gonna be bitter about it.
I've had a great time.
-[Prue sniffling] Sorry.
-[Sura] That's okay.
[Prue] You just had a bad week.
I hate white chocolate.
I hate chocolate, end of.
I don't think
I'll eat chocolate ever again.
[chuckles]
[Paul] I'm really sad to see Sura go.
Now that's a classic case of
you cannot have a weakness in your baking.
And unfortunately,
we found Sura's this week,
and it was that
that actually saved Lottie.
[Hermine laughing]
-[Paul] Just big it up for the next one.
-I'll try my best.
[sighs]
[Lottie] The sadness
that I feel at losing Sura
is at least partway made up
by Mark getting Star Baker.
That… I'll take that.
That will cheer me up.
-Well done, mate.
-[Mark] Thank you. Quite emotional.
-Are you?
-[Mark] Yeah.
-You're hiding it well. No.
-Am I?
[laughs] How did that happen?
Can't believe it.
Yeah. I just didn't expect it.
I think consistency pays off, doesn't it?
Thank you very much.
-[Paul] Well done. Really good.
-Surprised.
I'm delighted
that we're going down to the final
seven bakers, you know, like…
Seven, eight?
Eight. Is it eight?
Eight bakers. [laughs]
