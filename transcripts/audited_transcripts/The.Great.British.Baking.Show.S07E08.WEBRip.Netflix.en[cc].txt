-Hello, Henry.
-Hello.
[Prue] I actually like the crab on it.
It's very original.
I've never thought of that.
The sides look okay.
The layers look pretty good.
I'd like to have seen more caramelisation
on the potatoes.
I can't turn this over,
there's so much on it.
Let me turn over one of these.
-Nice colour underneath.
-[Prue] Nice pastry.
Nice lamination.
You can see the pastry very well.
Your flavours are delicious.
Oh, thank God.
A little hint of...
Is that chilli in there?
There's a bit of chilli and dill
in the crab.
[Paul] Beautiful.
If somebody had said to me,
"This is what Henry is going to do."
I'd have said, "Tell him not to."
-But I would have been wrong.
-[Sandi laughs]
-[Prue] It's delicious. Well done.
-Thank you.
-Well done, Henry.
-Thank you.
Cool.

*David*
[Paul] The layers look pretty good.
[Prue] The layers look excellent.
The burnt bits, though, not as much.
So, these are purple carrots.
Oh, they're the carrots. Okay.
[Sandi] If anything gets burnt,
just say it's purple.
But it isn't the most attractive thing
to want to eat.
-Yeah.
-[Paul] Right.
-Cuts well.
-Smells great.
[Paul] You've got a nice flaky base.
[Prue] Yeah, and crisp.
Can I have a little bit of that?
[David] Yeah. Just with it,
'cause it's quite dry.
-[Paul] Very dry, actually.
-[Prue] It needs the sauce, but...
it shouldn't be saved
by the sauce, really.
-We're judging the tarte tatin.
-[David] Hmm.
Your flavours are beautiful,
but it is very dry.
-I'm just gonna take a burnt bit.
-[David chuckles]
-Not burnt.
-[Sandi] Not burnt, purple.

*Alice*
[Prue] Well, I love the lattice.
It's very clever.
I'm a little disappointed
it doesn't look caramelised.
-Yeah.
-[Paul] The layers you can see...
I'm not sure about
how the texture's gonna be on this.
-Although we did get a nice...
-[Sandi] Sounds all right.
...crispy bit there.
Nice.
[Paul] It's a nice colour underneath.
You've got a little soggy line
running down there.
You can taste the honey
and it's lovely with the butter.
It is very delicious.
I love the apple and the leeks together.
The leeks melt in your mouth.
I just think it's too wet.
If you got a bit more colour on that...
-Yeah. Yeah.
-...you would have nailed it.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
Whew.

*Steph*
Erm...
I'm not sure about the goat's cheese
plonked on top like that.
[Prue] It looks like an add-on,
doesn't it?
Yeah.
[Paul] It cuts well.
Not very thick. Very thin.
[Sandi] Is that for me?
Very nice flavour.
The sweetness from the shallots
really comes through.
The caramelisation is great
because you got this slight toffee.
Goat's cheese does work well with it,
but I would have liked
to have seen it inside.
-Sorry, yeah.
-It is a bit thin, the pastry.
But I think the flavour
can't be argued with.
-Thank you.

*Rosie*
The flavour comes from
a red wine and balsamic reduction
with black garlic and chilli.
That's where the colour comes from.
I think it's partly where
the colour comes from.
-It looks a bit charred.
-[Rosie] Okay.
It's nice and thick.
-[Paul] It's a bit wet underneath there.
-[Prue] There are some layers.
-They are layers, but--
-But they are a bit soggy.
Ooh, this here, there.
The majority of it is quite wet.
I did make a mistake.
I put in twice the amount of butter
when I was doing my caramel,
-so everything was wet at the top.
-[Prue laughs]
[Paul] Right.
[Prue] Quite a lot of garlic.
You have to have friends around
who like a lot of garlic.
But that is a very soggy bottom.
[Sandi] It's like a membrane.
-[Paul] Thank you, Rosie.
-Thanks.

*Rosie*
Rosie, please bring up your vertical pie.
-Shall I come and help you?
-[Rosie] Yes, please.
[Prue chuckles]
This could go badly wrong.
Wow! It's like a...
strange game.
-[Paul] No rush.
-[Noel] Oh, my God.
-[Sandi] Hang on a minute.
-[Rosie] Okay.
Right, which way? Here?
[Paul] I think the design's amazing.
The knight down here, it's been blasted.
[Prue and Sandi laughing]
It's just lovely. It's imaginative.
-Thank you.
-It's very funny, too, which I love.
It's like a nasty giant
attacking a castle.
[laughing]
[Paul] The pastry's too thick
for the size of that.
-Yeah.
-[Paul] It should be much thinner.
The curry flavour is good...
but your filling is very dry
and it's very bitty.
It just falls apart.
I was just so scared of the moisture.
[Paul] Yeah, but it can be
your enemy as well.
-The dryness is probably worse.
-I know. Okay.
[Paul] I wanted to have
a quick look in the dragon.
He's a different filling.
-[Sandi and Prue groan]
-[Prue] Bye-bye, Bert.
[Prue chuckles]
[Sandi] St. George.
[Prue] Mm.
It's very dry, too.
I think the idea, the sculpture of it,
is excellent.
-I think the textures are all wrong.
-Okay.
-[Prue] Thanks, Rosie.
-[Paul] Thank you, Rosie.

*Alice*
The trunk of the tree,
it's very well done.
I think the overall design
with the swing as well is exceptional.
The pastry is tough as old boots.
You've just worked it too much.
I would not say it's tough as old boots,
but it isn't the tenderest pastry
we've ever had.
[Paul] And the filling's quite dry.
-You've taken too much moisture out if it.
-[Alice] Yeah.
[Prue] I very seldom say this,
but I would say there isn't quite enough
sweetness in the filling.
The idea is fantastic, but for me...
it's not quite there.
-Thank you, Alice.
-Okay. Thank you.
Very imaginative.

*David*
It's wonderfully intricate
and really interesting.
And it's obviously a big marine story.
You've got that whole idea
of three pies being one story.
I think the design is very good,
the way it's been constructed.
The exposed veg...
I don't really like.
It needs to be more of a lattice thing
to enclose it, for me.
[David] Mm.
[Paul] The pastry could have been baked
a bit longer underneath.
[Prue] Mmm.
Pastry is lovely and short.
[Paul] I think your filling
is slightly over-seasoned.
-I agree, it's a bit too salty.
-[Paul] Hmm.
[Prue] It's the smoked salmon.
And it feels quite dry.
You lost all the moisture
because it's got no lid.
It just blew away.

*Steph*
[Prue] Well, I love it.
The little horses are lovely.
The pastry is properly browned.
The little pastry...
-squares could have been thinner.
-[Steph] Mm-hmm.
And then put on the side.
They're a bit clumsy.
Okay.
[Paul] But it is neat,
and it's very organised.
It's very Steph.
[Prue chuckles] Yes.
[Prue] It's holding together nicely.
Hmm.
Delicious, Steph.
It's not too dry.
Curry flavours are lovely.
[Paul] To get a wall like that,
a filling that's not moving,
and still carry the moisture
and the spices,
it's really, really good.
-The pastry is nice and thin.
-And nice and thin.
Yeah, it's flaky.
That's a really nice pie.
-[Steph] Oh, thanks.
-Thank you, Steph.
-Well done.
-[Steph] Thank you.

*Henry*
[Noel] Henry, would you like to bring up
-your vertical pie?
-[Henry] Yes.
[groans]
-[Sandi exclaims]
-[Henry] This is terrifying.
Ooh, sh--
[all laughing]
[Prue] Right.
Well, my first feeling is,
basically, you've stacked
one pie on top of another...
-Okay.
-...which is a bit unimaginative.
Putting dried leaves on top of a pie
is never a good idea.
It just doesn't look good.
But let's look at
one of the pies, shall we?
[Paul clears throat]
-[Prue chuckles]
-[Sandi] What's that face?
[Paul sighs]
What am I gonna say, Henry?
My pastry is a little thick.
-[Paul] "A little thick"?
-[Prue chuckles]
-It's a lot thick.
-[Henry] Okay.
So much so that you've got
rawness in there as well.
You needed that paper-thin.
It is very dry.
If you'd used a fattier meat,
-you'd have got a better result.
-[Henry] Okay.
It's bone-dry.
What's happened is all the moisture's
come out the hole at the top.
It's a shame.
That's quite thick as well, isn't it?
Do you know what it tastes like?
Mince pie.
-[Prue] Hmm.
-[chuckles]
You're not getting a lot of chocolate.
You're not getting the pecan.
I'm getting more Christmas flavours
coming through.
-Do you like Christmas?
-Humbug.
[all laughing]
Erm, the idea's there, Henry,
but not executed
to the best of your ability.
Maddening.
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thank you.



We didn't try anything,
but it was a visual feast.
Unfortunately, that's where it stopped.
-Ah.
-[laughs]
[Prue] It was so disappointing.
[Noel] That horrible word
kept creeping back in.
-"Dry".
-[Prue] Dry.
The only one that got it right was Steph.
She's come from very middle ground
to put herself in line for Star Baker.
David must be up there for Star Baker
because he came first in the Technical...
And his design was amazing.
Let's look at who we're worried about.
The one I was, I suppose,
most disappointed by is Henry.
The dryness and the thickness
of the pastry.
It was just so disappointing,
was it not, as a design?
[Prue] Yes, he just stacked a few pies,
one on top of another,
said it's an upside-down chandelier,
and that's the theme.
Even though he did well in his Signature,
he struggled with the Technical,
and he struggled with this as well.
I imagine we're worried about Rosie.
You didn't particularly
like her Signature.
No, it didn't look particularly good.
[Paul] And the Showstopper,
she struggled a bit.
The design was probably one of the best,
but it was very, very dry.
The whole thing just fell to pieces.
I think they're both in trouble.
To come this far,
it's a terrible point in the competition
to go out, isn't it?
Well done, my lovely bakers.
This is the moment we find out
who is going through to the semifinal.
I can tell you that one person
who definitely is,
is the Star Baker of this week,
and that person is...
Steph.
[Henry] Oh, my darling.
That means I've got
the horrible, horrible job
of announcing which baker is going home.
The baker who's leaving us this week is...
Henry.
[Prue] Oh, Henry.
Oh, my darling.
I met Paul outside the Bake Off tent
when I was 12.
I remember shaking his hand.
[Paul] Unlucky, mate.
[Henry] And I never thought
it would get to a stage
where I was standing behind
one of the benches in there,
actually baking.
I think you struggled a bit today.
-Just a bit. [laughs]
-[Paul] Yeah.
I think he's done a great job, overall,
and he has improved.
I just think, overall,
the other four are better.
It has been a pleasure, darling.
Henry!
Oh, darling Rosie.
[Rosie] Really, really sad
to see Henry go.
Henry is awesome. He's great.
But so happy to still be here.
-[Prue] Well done.
-Thank you.
[Prue] Rosie's still not
believing her luck.
[laughing]
[speaking indistinctly]
What?
Oh, wow. Wow, wow, wow.
And pastry!
Well done, Steph-Steph.
Steph's Showstopper was faultless.
I could not find a single thing
to complain on.
Is this real? [chuckles]
