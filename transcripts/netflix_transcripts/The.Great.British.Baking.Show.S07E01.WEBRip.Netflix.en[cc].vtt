00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Signature Challenge,

111
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the judges would like you

112
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It can be any size, any shape...

113
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it must contain
a significant amount of dried fruit.

114
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Significant?
-Yeah, more than one currant, I think.

115

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

117
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, as well as being perfectly baked,
it must be beautifully decorated.

118

121

126
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The fruitcake, for me,
is one of those basics of baking.

127

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>but it's about the consistency</i>

129
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

will drop down to the bottom.

130
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

131

So, they have to get those cakes

134

135
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because we want it decorated as well.

136
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

137
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that'll just melt.

138

139
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

140
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to be exactly the same.

144
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

146
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, tell us all about your fruitcake.
What are you doing?

147
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
So, I'm doing, like, a Christmas cake.

148
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Erm, it's something my mum used to make
all the time when I was a kid.

149
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She'd literally make them in October,

150
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
like, soak the fruit beforehand
and then keep pouring brandy in them.

151
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, to speed things up a bit,
I've put my fruit over heat

152
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and just let it simmer
while I'm getting the cake mix ready.

153
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-[Prue] I never bother to do it ahead.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a significant amount of fruit.

162
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

putting that much fruit in it,

a great-looking cake actually.

615
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great colour.

616
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very nice.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I'm hoping it'll be lovely anyway.

628
00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very chewy,
and it hints at being underbaked.

629
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

630
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a lovely-looking loaf.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think if you'd pulled back
on the almond essence,

634
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you would've had a perfect loaf.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'd hang that on a door,
wouldn't you?

637
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Paul] I love ginger.
-Yeah, it's got a kick to it.

639
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

641
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could've pulled back a little bit
on the other ginger.

642
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Sometimes, going back to basics...

643
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Don't try and overdo something.

644
00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
The decoration is beautifully done
in spite of having your fingers up...

645
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like a pincer. [laughing]

646
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the flavour is absolutely lovely.

647
00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think you've created
a very good tea cake.

648
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

649
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not bad considering
you've only got one finger.

650
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

a bit rustic.

653
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You added more fruit to this,
didn't you?

654
00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

all the way through.

657
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

658
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

actually tastes quite nice.

I just think your baking's way out.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Prudence and Paulette to leave the tent.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am feeling a little mean.

715
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It sounds simple enough,

716
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the point is it's a Genoese sponge,

717
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's really easy for that mixture
to become flat.

718
00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they over-mix,
it's not just volume they'll lose,

719
00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the texture becomes rubbery,
and it has to be light.

720
00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now let's have a taste.

721
00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Takes me back, actually,
to when I was a kid.

722
00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You get the raspberry, you get the lemon.

723
00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've just got a vanilla one.

724
00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavours are delicate,
but strong enough.

725
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it tastes delicious.
I think it's a great challenge.

726
00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We don't know what the bakers are like.

727
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're beginning to get to know them,

728
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I think that's a pretty cruel
Technical Challenge. Great though.

729
00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-Great though.

730
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You like a bit of cruelty.
-[laughing] I do, yeah.

731
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That starts them off on the right foot.

732
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Amelia] "First fold the foil paper

734
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got some maths in here.

735
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it could go brilliantly
or it could go horribly.

736
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just a little bit of origami
at the moment.

737
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because of my Signature this morning,
I've definitely got a lot more pressure.

738
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But luckily, the instructions so far
look pretty clear.

739
00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So far. I'm only on step one.

740
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, so, "For the Genoese,

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] And in time call news...
-Bakers, you've got half an hour left.

817
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-That's all from us.

818
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, that's no good, is it?
I'm gonna run out of time.

819
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need to make the Italian meringue.
I actually know how to make that.

820
00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Slowly pour the hot syrup
onto the egg whites."

821
00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then she says, "Add the butter until
the buttercream is smooth and thick."

822
00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Should go nice and glossy.
It looks okay at the moment.

823
00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've come to love you, Jamie,
'cause I think you might need it.

824
00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, it's failed again, so...
-[Sandi] What went wrong?

825
00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It turned out like this.
-Okay.

826
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then I tried to make it again.

827
00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A bit lumpy.
-And then it got even worse.

828
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So, now I'm--
-It is a bit lumpy, darling.

829
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's... It's rubbish.

830
00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not even worth putting that in.
I'm gonna do two layers.

831
00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Priya] These have been in for 12 minutes.

832
00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I'm getting it out.

833
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know if this is meant
to look like this.

834
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] I said I was putting them
in the oven for ten minutes.

835
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Still says ten minutes.
I never started the timer.

836
00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh, they look a bit like an Aero.

837
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're about twice the height of mine.

838
00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Helena] Seriously,
my sponge is like rubber. [chuckles]

839
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks all right actually.

840
00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, "Sandwich with buttercream."

841
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is not buttercream,
this is meringue. So bad.

842
00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've not had any angel cakes before.
Hopefully, this is right.

843
00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not looking quite right,

844
00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm making the buttercream.
I'm not gonna do nothing.

845
00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Cover with the white fondant icing
and feather with the pink."

846
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] I'm not sure whether
to ice it and then cut it,

847
00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:33.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or to cut it and then ice it.

848
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Henry] I'm going for ice, then slice.
It says to do that.

849
00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm being very obedient.

850
00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Five minutes left.

851
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've got five minutes?

852
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't panic! Don't panic!

853
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jamie] Look at that.
They might actually refuse to try it.

854
00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:46.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I literally wouldn't be surprised.

855
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is rubber. [chuckles nervously]

856
00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not even just saying that.
It is rubber.

857
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I've gotta draw some lines.

858
00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never feathered before.

859
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The secret to feathering
is a sharp cocktail stick and wet icing.

860
00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mine has gone mental.
What the hell did I get myself into?

861
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] My hands are shaking a bit.

862
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have one minute left.

863
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-[Jamie] Oh, my days.

864
00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] My hands are shaking so much.

865
00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a chance of them being like,
"Literally that's inedible."

866
00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it fell on the floor,
it'll bounce right back.

867
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Priya] I can say with confidence
I won't be winning this challenge.

868
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cut it into six, right?
Enough for everyone. [chuckles]

869
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Bakers, that is the end
of your Technical Challenge.

870
00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Phew!

871
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, well.

872
00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well done, everybody.
Please bring your bakes up to the table

873
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and place them
in front of your photograph.

874
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jamie] They're not gonna eat it.
It's inedible, like, literally.

875
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Dan, do you wanna swap?
-[laughs]

876
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel]<i> Prue and Paul will now judge</i>

877
00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>the bakers' first Technical Challenge.</i>

878
00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>They're expecting</i>
<i>six identical angel cake slices</i>

879
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

880
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>and topped with a feathered fondant icing.</i>

881
00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

882
00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's lost all the height and the spring
in the sponge, and that red is too much.

883
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Where's the silky smooth
Italian buttercream?

884
00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's melted.
-It's not there. It's melted out.

885
00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flavours are there, but it's like rubber.

886
00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I dropped that on the floor,
it'd bounce up and hit me in the face.

887
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-[Prue] This one's feathering's better.

888
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] However, still not
as high as they should be.

889
00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavours are there.

890
00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Too much icing on the top, I think.

891
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Moving on, these look all the same.

892
00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, that is much higher, isn't it?
And it's pink rather than red.

893
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's got nice flavours in there.
-Mmm. Yeah, that's not bad.

894
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think this is another,
not to mince words, failure.

895
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Where's the bottom layer?
It's missing one.

896
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laugh]

897
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know,
it actually tastes rather nice.

898
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laugh]

899
00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're missing a layer,
and rubbery to taste as well.

900
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This looks a little bit more delicate.
There's a bit of height to that sponge.

901
00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] And everything is pastel shades.

902
00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm. It tastes delicious.
-Yeah, and the raspberry one's okay.

903
00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Right.
-[Paul] I like the feathering on this.

904
00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are fairly equal.

905
00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Buttercream's good. Nice flavour.

906
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, moving on again.

907
00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very thin, it's lost all its height.

908
00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But the buttercream
looks beautiful. They're not bad.

909
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm, a bit rubbery.

910
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This looks quite delicate,
however, the two sponges look the same.

911
00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And the lemon should have
a little bit of colour.

912
00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ooh, it's a bit tough.
-[Paul] Hmm, it is.

913
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, I like the feathering
on that one. It's very neat.

914
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] And that looks jolly tough.

915
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just dried a bit on the edges,
but it's not that tough.

916
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Talk about neat. That's not.

917
00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the sponge is okay,

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Might have to deconstruct it
until I'm ready.

1324
00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all right.

1325
00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No pressure.

1326
00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have ten minutes left.

1327
00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just throw food colouring at it,
it will be fine.

1328
00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[David] Michelle,
do you think you're on time?

1330
00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Jamie] Starting to panic a bit now.

1333
00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mine doesn't really look
like a birthday cake, now, does it?

1334
00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, God, I don't know if I'm gonna
have time to put the tube in the middle,

1335
00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yesterday, the chicks didn't have eyes
but dogs definitely have to have eyes.

1338
00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1340
00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Phil] Hopefully it'll stay.

Don't worry, it's only
our childhood dreams on the line.

I can do anything else, can I? [exhales]

1347
00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Amelia] Oh, don't run out of icing now.

1348
00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1349
00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need to just pipe the face.
I might have time. So annoying.

1350
00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1353
00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1355
00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, my God. That is not
what I wanna see when I turn around.

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Amelia] Dan, that looks sick.

1358
00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't. I feel sick.

Michelle, would you bring up
your birthday cake, please?

1363
00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. It's absolutely exquisite.

1364
00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the detail, and it's neat.
It's tidy.

1365

it's just gotta taste good.

1366
00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is a carrot cake with
orange cream cheese frosting.

1367
00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1373
00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The balance of spices

1374
00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's nice and moist inside there,
and the design as well.

1375
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's very delicate. It's very charming.

1381
00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's see what it tastes like, shall we?

1382
00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The waft of chocolate is just terrific.

1383
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got coffee in there, which actually
blends beautifully with the chocolate.

1386
00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That doesn't look like a book.

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Prue] This is just a little bit clumsy,

1391
00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I love the concept.

1392
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've made a chocolate orange sponge
and chocolate orange buttercream.

1393
00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I hadn't just had a better one,
I would've said it was an excellent cake,

1394
00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but this is slightly drier.

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you'd spent less time
with the cake in the oven

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and more time getting it finished,

1397
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you probably would've been all right.

1398
00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's really impressive,
and it didn't collapse.

1399
00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It didn't collapse, no.

1400
00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Some of it's a bit rough and ready,
but let's see what it tastes like.

1401
00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very light sponge.

1402
00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That is a beautiful cake.
-Thank you.

1403
00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you do hit the raspberry,
it is deliciously balanced.

1404
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit simplistic
but I think you've done well.

1405
00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's so effective.
It makes me feel quite nostalgic.

1406
00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel laughs]
-I can remember 1969

1407
00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-even if you boys can't.
-[laughter]

1408
00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-First man on the Moon, 1969.
-Exactly, and I watched him land.

1409
00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is a good design.
However, it is leaning.

1410
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is sherbet, isn't it?
-Mm-hmm.

1411
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For me, it's a little too sweet.

1412
00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs more sharpness
to balance out the sweetness.

1413
00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would never have thought
of that for a cake.

1414
00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The design is spectacular.

1415
00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you've done a good job.

1416
00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a good thing
you've got the blackberries there

1417
00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:36.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because it's quite a sweet cake.

1418
00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] You want that rich chocolate.

1419
00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you never had that blackberry in there,
I wouldn't like it at all.

1420

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] You've been very restrained
about the colours.

1422
00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is a classy grown-up's version
of a child's dream.

1423
00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Amelia] Yeah.

1424
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I expected a little bit
more than that.

[Prue] But let's see what it tastes like.

1426
00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a red velvet cake with
white chocolate ganache and raspberry jam.

1427
00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's a pretty claggy cake.

1428
00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It doesn't taste good actually.

1429
00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I see what you were going for
but I think you're slightly off the mark.

1430
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I love the idea that you dropped it.
-[Steph] Yeah.

1431
00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Which happens always
when you've got children on the beach.

1432
00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Always. Yeah.

1433
00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That's a crumbly cake.

1434
00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] It's raspberry ripple and coconut.

1435
00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it must be a bit overbaked
'cause it's a little bit dry as a result.

1436
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, okay.

1437
00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flavours are good.
Concentrate on your baking.

1438
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1439
00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I think it looks
absolutely amazing.

1440
00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's charming.
I think it's a fantastic-looking cake.

1441
00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The egg has something in it as well.

1442
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Oh, it's baby snakes.
-[Paul] Ah.

1443
00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, wow. Brilliant and creepy.

1444
00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-[Noel] In a good way.

1445
00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] Yeah.

1446
00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] That's a very nice
thin layer of icing, well done.

1447
00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:51.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is a beautiful cake.

1448
00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chocolate, the citrus,
it all marries up lovely,

1449
00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and to finish it off looking like that,
well done, David.

1450
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very, very good cake.

1451
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it’s a little bit simplistic
for me.

1452
01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-[Paul] A bit clumsy.

1453
01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I very seldom disagree with Paul,
but I love the exterior.

1454
01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tell us all about your birthday cake.

1455
01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s a red velvet cake
with an Italian meringue buttercream.

1456
01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Nice equal layers.

1457
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cake’s baked beautifully.
The Italian buttercream is silky smooth.

1458
01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the interior for me works,
the exterior doesn’t.

1459
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1460
01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Oh, my goodness.
-It looks great.

1461
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you've ended up with a design

1462
01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that any kid would be happy getting
on their birthday.

1463
01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Remind me of those flavours again.

1464
01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michael] It’s a chocolate and coffee
sponge with salted caramel buttercream.

1465
01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It’s a great-looking sponge.

1466
01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the texture, but I think
it needed a bit more chocolate.

1467
01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s good. Just think about your flavours.

1468
01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] I like the gold bars.
-[crunching]

1469
01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very good.
-A couple of big kids.

1470
01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Well done, Michael. Thank you.
-Thank you.

1471
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It’s a waterfall.

1472
01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very beautifully done.
-[Paul] It’s clever.

1473
01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s very clever.
-I mean, I could see kids

1474
01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-going for that straightaway.
-[Prue] Yeah.

1475
01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s lime and coconut cake
with coconut buttercream

1476
01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and passion fruit curd.

1477
01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Strong coconut. Where’s the passion fruit?

1478
01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s in the curd.
-It’s there, it’s so slight.

1479
01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s more of it in the middle.
[laughing]

1480
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laugh]

1481
01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s not there either.
-[Michelle] Oh.

1482
01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you go further up, there’s more.

1483
01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get it?

1484
01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughter]
-Not really, no.

1485
01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:41.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your flavour ideas were sound,
but you’re not bringing it through.

1486
01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the design, I think,
is very, very good.

1487
01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How many sponges are in there?
-Four.

1488
01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] And you got salted caramel
in between each layer?

1489
01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it’s like a... [voice breaks]
Ooh, crikey.

1490
01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughing] That’s embarrassing.
-[Sandi] Is your voice breaking?

1491
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Finally.

1492
01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1493
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it's...

1494
01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, it’s got buttercream
and caramel sauce between each layer.

1495
01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] That looks pretty good.
-Oh, I see.

1496
01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're your dog biscuits.
-Yeah.

1497
01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, those biscuits are really nice.

1498
01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are they? Oh, nice.
-[Prue] Mmm.

1499
01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One mouthful is lovely.
It’s like eating a toffee.

1500
01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Prue] But a whole slice would be

1501
01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
overwhelmingly salted caramel.

1502
01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your cake’s overbaked.

1503
01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s not a lot of finesse
about this cake.

1504
01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Thank you.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, that didn’t go well, did it?
[laughs]

1507
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
what it’s gonna be like.

1508
01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Er... [laughs] I don’t know what to say.

1509
01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hold on, hold on. "Faultless".

during cake week.

1511

Staying in this competition now
would mean everything.

1512
01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need a lifeline. Throw me a bone.

1513
01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m just prepared for the worst,
and if it happens, it happens.

1514
01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah. Oh, my God. I don’t wanna get filmed
with tears in my eyes.

1515

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That was amazing. I thought
they really came into their own.

1519
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Their personalities started to come out.

1520
01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When we walked into the room,

1521
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it was just this sea
of amazing Showstoppers.

1522
01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My favourite is still the first one.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] She did okay in the Technical,
she did well in the Signature,

1525
01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1526
01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, she’s up there or thereabouts.

1527
01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Steph deserves a mention
up there as well.

1528
01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Steph’s cake was pretty good.

1529
01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Third in Technical,
she did pretty well in the Signature too.

1530
01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Henry, who had done brilliantly
in the Technical,

1531
01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-not so pleased?
-Henry had a good day yesterday, yeah.

1532
01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Today, he’s not done so well.
-[Paul] No, he hasn't.

1533
01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
People for me who are in a little bit
of trouble, I have to say Jamie.

1534
01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
His Signature was good,
but he was bottom of Technical.

1535
01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Today, he struggled with the Showstopper.

1536
01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dan, because I was trying
to hunt down the flavour.

1537
01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Although the design was pretty good.

1538
01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But 13 pieces of cake.
Are you all right?

1539
01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-Not quite.

1540
01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both laugh]

1541
01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well done, bakers. That is your first week
in the tent successfully completed.

1542
01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sigh of relief, I’m sure.

1543
01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I have to tell you, Paul and Prue say

1544
01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the standard has been incredibly high.
So, well done.

1545
01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve got the fantastic job
of announcing Star Baker.

1546
01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:43.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The person who is Star Baker
this week is...

1547
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Michelle.

1548
01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Michael] Yes.
-[all cheering]

1549
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[indistinct chatter]

1550
01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Amazing. Well done.
-Thank you.

1551
01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, that leaves me with the horrible job
of sending somebody home,

1552
01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I have to say,
even after the first week,

1553
01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it is incredibly difficult, but I’m afraid

1554
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
one of you has to depart,
and that person is...

1555
01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dan. I'm so sorry.

1556
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bad call, mate.
-[chuckling] I know, mate. I know, mate.

1557
01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I had a bad week.</i>

1558
01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Well done, Phil.

1559
01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Definitely, I’ll take away
the friendships.

1560
01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Phil] What are we gonna do without you?
-[Dan laughs]

1561
01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can’t imagine how everyone’s bonded.
It’s so strange.

1562
01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alice] Aw, Dan.
-[David] He’s such a beautiful man.

1563
01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m not gonna miss
the baking under pressure.

1564
01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just gonna miss everybody in that tent.

1565
01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Sorry, mate.
-[Dan] No, no, it’s all right.

1566
01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] <i>He’s a great baker, Dan,</i>

1567
01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but unfortunately,
it all boiled down to his Signature bake,

1568
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it was that
that was the cause of him going.

1569
01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pick it up a bit, all right?
It was really close.

1570
01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jamie] <i>I thought it was gonna be me.</i>

1571
01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m looking forward to coming back
and almost starting again.

1572
01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Convince people I can bake. [laughs]

1573
01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, when you come on
and you can’t even bake a cake properly,

1574
01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it doesn't look good, does it?

1575
01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Michelle] Oh, my God.
-[Amelia] You must be so pleased.

1576
01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michelle] I can’t get over it.
I’m so shocked.

1577
01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To get Star Baker, I’m just so proud.

1578

1583

You know, this is the tenth anniversary,
and what a way to start.

1584
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That Showstopper was pretty well
the best cake I’ve ever eaten. [laughs]
