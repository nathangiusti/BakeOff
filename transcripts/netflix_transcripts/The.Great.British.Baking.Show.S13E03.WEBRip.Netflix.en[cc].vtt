until practising for this, obviously,

of little balls of dough.

50
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why is it called monkey bread?
There's got to be a reason.

51
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The reason it's called monkey bread is
everybody pulls a little piece off.

you see in markets.

57
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you're gonna have to come up
with something that is quite unique.

58
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

really be quite strong in this challenge.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a celebration of colour, flavour,

63
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
lots of seeds.

64
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

65
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But above all,
it's down to the bake and proving.

66
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Proving is gonna be the one

67
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

this particular challenge.

or you underprove or underbake,

69
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's gonna be a problem.

I think it looks great.

-Thank you.
-I'm gonna just take a little wedge.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, we have blue cheese
and it has pear and fennel.

412
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For the next one, we have a harder cheese,
and it has apple and caramelised onion.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then for the last one,

414
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we have a Brie-style
with blackberry and rosemary.

415
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the flavour.

416
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's that wonderful sharpness
from the blackberries.

417
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, it's just really rich cheese.

418
00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Superb. Love the flavours.

419
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was getting some… was it nuts in there?

420
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nuts, rolled in, er, walnuts.

421
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It worked really well with the pear
and the blue cheese together.

422
00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've ended up
with something that's quite delicious.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Prue] I think it looks really appetising.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's interesting
that you've used so many seeds.

427
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's enough seeds.
Like the bottom of a birdcage, innit?

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I have got a pear, Stilton
and walnut monkey bread.

430
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's really nicely baked,
so that the outside is really crispy.

431
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I really like
the flavour of the pear.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stilton is lacking.
-Okay.

433
00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You needed
a little bit more Stilton in there.

434
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Love the look of it. Quite quaint.

438
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, these ones are the French onion soup.

439
00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These ones are the steak.
And these ones are the croque monsieur.

440
00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's delicious.
It's quite sweet because there's onion.

441
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flavours are great.
Punchy, strong, spot on.

442
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That croque monsieur,
I spent two years in Paris as a student.

-I lived on croque monsieur.
-[Paul] Yeah.

444
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it tastes like it.

445
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dough needs lightening up a little bit.
It's a bit heavy.

446
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] The balls are quite big,
which makes it more tear-and-share

449

450
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nevertheless, it looks good,
and it looks well baked as well.

451
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. Flavour, it's bacon and onions,

452
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
cheese and parsley, and a bit of pesto.

453
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite sweet, actually.

454
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-It's a bit oversweet.

455
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need to celebrate the savoury
and not the sweet.

456
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A bit stodgy as well.

457
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a little doughy,

458
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but if you get a bit towards the edge,
it's absolute perfection.

459
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

is the fact that it does fall apart.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

fig and thyme.

-[Nadia] Okay.

470
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Because it's broken up a lot.

471
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Nadia] It's all the flavours of Calabria.

472
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've got the 'nduja,

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I've made it into a cream
with mascarpone.

475
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

479
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't argue with the flavours.
The flavours are amazing.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I like the fact that you've got

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they are slightly misshaped,
but that's fine.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

an Italian flavour-inspired bread.

490
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we have porcini mushroom and garlic,
and then red pesto and green pesto knots.

491
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think the pesto one's a bit weak.

494
00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think proving is a little bit shy
and needed longer.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overall, it's not bad.
I think your flavour's just lacking.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Not getting the rosemary with the olive.
I'd like to see more olive.

508
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even then, I would have always
had coriander with an olive.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just that if I didn't know
there were olives in there,

511
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wouldn't necessarily know there was.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if you sat down with some friends
and that.

513
00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Glass of wine. Perfect.
-Agreed, yeah.

514
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Jasmine.
-Thank you.

515
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just need some wine and some friends.

516
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-And coriander.

517
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

519
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
At first glance, I would have perhaps
liked a little glaze on.

520
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did you glaze them at all?
-I forgot.

521
00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] 'Cause that's… This means
they're a little dull to look at.

522
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They could be sort of shiny.
-I know.

523
00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The size of them are good.
The balls look a nice size.

524
00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The red dough is red bean curd,
and the green is like an Asian pesto,

525
00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the other one with sesame seeds.

526
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is there a little chili in there?
-Little bit.

527
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It needs more salt.

528
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sesame one
has very little flavour to it.

529
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's the same with this.

530
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A little more salt
would bring out the flavour.

531
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Mm.
The balls actually are baked all right.

532
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Probably need a little bit more proving
just to open them up a bit.

533
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just not getting
a huge amount of flavour in there.

534
00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, okay.

535
00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[gentle music playing]

536
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
So my monkey bread was going to be
onion-flavoured with some yeast extract.

537
00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you say "was",
you're talking in the past tense.

538
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't get pretty much any rise on it.

539
00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, it's sort of
trying to grow and it can't,

540
00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so basically, it's sort of fallen apart.

541
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] That's…
-[Aaron] I know.

542
00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Oh, wow! It's like raw.

543
00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Doesn't look
as if it's been in the oven.

544
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] No, it doesn't, does it?
-It's literally like dough.

545
00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gentle music playing]

546
00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Has a good flavour.
-[Paul] Has a great flavour.

547
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the texture is so awful
that you couldn't eat it.

548
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a shame, yeah.
-Bad luck.

549
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-I mean, thank you for your kind words.

550
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] Cheers, guys.

552
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, I think that their words

553
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
were a lot kinder than my bake deserved,
if I'm honest.

554
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's just piled on the pressure

555
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to try and do better
in the other challenges,

556
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which I didn't really want today.

557
00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I was as close to a handshake
as I may ever be, so I'll take that.

558
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said the word "superb".
You don't hear "superb" a lot.

559
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm happy with that.

560
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am little bit disappointed
about the flavour bit.

561
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I should put a bit more salt.

562
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not looking forward
to Technical challenge.

563
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will be at the bottom again.

564
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not my thing.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to make his take

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
on that fast food classic,
the glazed ring doughnut.

584
00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He'd like you to make
twelve ring-shaped doughnuts.

585
00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All should be covered
in a classic vanilla glaze,

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and six of them should be dipped
in a strawberry icing.

587
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a lot riding on this, kids,
so doughnut mess this up.

about deep frying.

594
00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, who has a machine like that at home?

595
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Jessika] Do you?
-No, I do not.

596
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn't make doughnuts.
I'd be making fish and chips.

597
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ooh.
-Look at that.

598
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never made doughnuts before.

599
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I make doughnuts many times.
Should be okay.

600
00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, I know you like a doughnut.

601
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll be honest with you.
Doughnuts are my guilty pleasure.

602
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For a main course,
I'd have a load of hot dogs,

603
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then for dessert,
have a load of doughnuts.

604
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That would be my ideal meal.

605
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look easy, but actually, it isn't.

606
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They need to use as much time as possible
on the proving.

607
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Notice that on every one of these

608
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you have a white band
that runs round the middle.

609
00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they don't have the white band,
it hasn't been proved enough.

610
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The chances are it's gonna be quite dense.

611
00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, have you told them
how long to prove for?

612
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, they don't need to be told that.

613
00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would have thought one of the problems
is getting that ring.

614
00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They've got several
little cutters actually,

615
00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so the chances are

-Yes.

825
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Right.

826
00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, for the first one,
they don't look too bad.

827
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-They're the right colour, aren't they?

828
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Decoration's pretty good.
It's pretty even.

829
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue] Hmm. Nice and light.

830
00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's nice on the mouth.
It's quite soft. Good.

831
00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Good.
-[Paul] Okay.

832
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It hasn't proved enough.
You see there's no white line.

833
00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is much too much icing on that.
Look at that.

834
00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's an acceptable doughnut.

835
00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Hmm.
-[Prue] But it's a bit heavier. Yeah.

836
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] These are massively underproved
and very, very dark.

837
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look inside.

838
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They took a bit of a saw.
You see how dense that is.

839
00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Overfried as well.

840
00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The flavours are good,
but the texture's all wrong.

841
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And they're uneven.
Some of them are much smaller than others.

842
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah, these don't look too bad.

843
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Well, this one doesn't look
as if it's iced at all.

844
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The icing has been so liquid,
it's just disappeared.

845
00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm, soft.

846
00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The crumb is nice.
-Mm.

847
00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The texture's okay. Nice shape.

848
00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, look at the inconsistencies.

849
00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] This is a tiny little one.

850
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Look how dark it is.

851
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That actually tastes burnt as well.

852
00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's very greasy, look.
-[Paul] Mm.

853
00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, I quite like these.

854
00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The icing on this isn't particularly neat.

855
00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They match.

856
00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] True.
-[Prue] Quite original.

857
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's thinly glazed,
which is what I like.

858
00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Absolutely. White line's there.
-[Prue] They've got the white line.

859
00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is quite light inside as well.

860
00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mm, tastes good.
-It's delicious.

861
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These are so uneven.

862
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, some of them look well risen
and some of them look tiny.

863
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, it's not as tight
as I thought it would be.

864
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

865
00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, that's one of the bigger ones.

866
00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Mm.
-[Paul] Yeah.

867
00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's as if they've been done
in two batches.

868
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Very inconsistent.

869
00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles] Look,
someone's tried to be clever.

870
00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Oh. Well, why not?
I think that looks really good.

871
00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not quite the decoration
we told you to do, but it's lovely.

872
00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The lines are good, the consistency
and the colour is pretty decent.

873
00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Gosh, that's very big bubbles in there.
-[Paul] Mm.

874
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it's quite open.
It's been well mixed.

875
00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Overall, these don't look too bad.

876
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The shaping has created a bit of an issue.

877
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needed to be slightly thicker
on the glaze on this runoff.

878
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] This dough is nice and spongy.

879
00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is. It tastes okay.

880
00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Just a little bit uneven.

881
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The icing is pretty terrible.
-Look.

882
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, the icing on this is a bit thin.

883
00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then, ironically,
when you move on to the last one,

884
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this is just way, way too thick,
and they're all inconsistent as well.

885
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit of a mess.

886
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're quite big.
-[Prue] Yeah, they're nicely risen.

887
00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bigger ones are really good doughnuts.

888
00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

889

893
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do like the decoration,
I like the icing.

1338
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The icing consistency is spot on as well.
It's very pretty.

1339
00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it's got cinnamon and cardamom in it.

1340
00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cardamom level
and the cinnamon level are very nice,

1341
00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and, actually,
the dough's baked beautifully.

1342
00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got a good amount of swirls
in there.

1343
00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So that is very good.

1344
00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And also,
I think it looks incredibly pretty

00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it tastes fantastic.

00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:01.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Mm. Well done, Jasmine.

1348
00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] A bit wonky,
but I think it looks very good.

1349
00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Let's see what it's like inside.

1350
00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has marzipan inside,

1351
00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the bread is enriched
with butter, eggs, apple juice and milk.

1352
00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bread It's not quite done.
It's quite doughy.

1353
00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is such a pity,

1354
00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I think that is
the best-tasting stollen I've ever had.

1355
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah.

1357
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] Well, I think it's really dramatic,
very neatly done.

1358
00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I do like the bold colour
on the outside.

1359
00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it looks stunning.

1360
00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is orange cinnamon
and pecan cinnamon rolls.

1361
00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:42.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mm, I love the crunchy filling,
and the cream cheese icing is lovely.

1362
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Love it.

1363
00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What I do like is the bread itself.

1364
00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's light, but then the fillings
just really pack a punch.

1365
00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's beautiful, yeah.

1366
00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done, Tom, excellent.
-Thank you so much, guys.

1367
00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I like the little figures,
the colours are great.

1368
00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a little bit clumsy,
but the bake is lovely.

1369
00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Let's have a look
and see what it's like inside.

1370
00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a Japanese milk bread
filled with a creme pat,

1371
00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
infused with some orange zest
and some cardamom.

1372
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And there's an apricot conserve.

1373
00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All the flavour comes from the creme pat.

1374
00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-You want something more.

1375
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe fruit inside the bread
would've been nice as well.

1376
00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You could've done more with the bread.
-Sure.

1377

1378
00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I love the bake on it. I love the shine.

1379
00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It really looks so appetising.

1380
00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So this is a orange
and rum-soaked raisin sweet bread

1381
00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in a Korovai style.

1382
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The texture's absolutely lovely.

1383
00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's springy, nicely baked.

1384
00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've done a great job.

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] It's highly decorated.

1389
00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's a little bit clumsy.

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've done the lace nicely,
but it's got a few joins.

1391
00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I added orange zest, rum, vanilla extract,

1392
00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1397
00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

with a cinnamon and apple swirl filling.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's underbaked, sadly.

1443
01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is it?
-[Paul] It's certainly underproved.

1444
01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's really claggy.

1445
01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You cannot put apple in a bread like this

1446
01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because apple will leak moisture
into a dough as it's trying to prove,

1447
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which will make it quite gloopy as well.

1448
01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just needed more punch.

1449
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Thank you, Iain.

1451
01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] You know,
I think it looks absolutely astonishing.

1452
01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I actually love the look of this.

1453
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the couronne
because it's exposing what's inside.

1454
01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that's how it should look.

1455
01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But let's have a look and see, shall we?

1456
01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:59.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bread is a couronne with pistachio,
marzipan, cherries, apricots,

1457
01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and there is a light rose icing
on there as well.

1458
01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, Aaron.

1459
01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles softly]
-That's beautiful.

1460
01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pistachio, marzipan, the fruit level.

1461
01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's really tasty.

1462
01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've done
a decent job with that,

1463
01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the flavours you've chosen
have worked really well on this.

1464
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that's pretty faultless.

1465
01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a great tribute.

1466
01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Paul] Well done.

1468

-[Alison] Well done.

1469
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1471
01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would have to say
I think that was probably

1472
01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
one of the most beautiful things
I've ever actually made.

1473
01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1474
01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, equally…
[laughs] my Signature was so poor.

1475
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So there's always a possibility
we could go home.

1476
01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that was the worst feedback
that anyone has gotten so far.

1477
01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They didn't like flavour,
they didn't like the bake,

1478
01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they didn't like anything.

1479
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I, 100%, think I'm going home.

1480
01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They seemed to really like it.

1481
01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, which is great. [laughing]

1482
01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I'm proud, I'm happy.

1483
01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm also aware that there's a lot
of other amazing bakes in there.

1485
01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That was a wild ride, wasn't it?
What a Showstopper.

1486
01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was surprised about Iain's.

1487
01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let himself down a little bit on that one.

1488
01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't think it looked
as bad as you two.

1489
01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was my perfect birthday cake.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes, exactly. It's your style, darling.

1491
01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, and who's in line
for going home then?

1492
01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Going into the Showstopper, it was Pui Man
and Nataliia who were in trouble.

1493
01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought Nataliia's Showstopper
was quite clumsy and not exciting.

1494
01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Hmm. Yeah.
-It was okay.

1495
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I did really like Pui Man's.

1496
01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought,
"This is the comeback kid again".

1497
01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She always saves herself
in the Showstopper.

1498
01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, but in the Technical,
she's either been down at the bottom

1499
01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or second from bottom
in the last three weeks.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So who's in line for Star Baker?

1502
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Tom's really
pushed himself up today.

1505
01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

second in the Technical,

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I thought
her Showstopper was fantastic.

1508
01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
