00:16:19.925 --> 00:16:20.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
traybake.

409
00:16:25.925 --> 00:16:27.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tough as old boots.

410
00:16:27.885 --> 00:16:30.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the top is very sloppy
so you've got sloppy and tough.

411
00:16:30.725 --> 00:16:31.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Sounds like a terrible double act,

412
00:16:32.485 --> 00:16:33.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sloppy and Tough.

413
00:16:41.445 --> 00:16:42.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You were right about the rum.

414
00:16:43.325 --> 00:16:44.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very rummy.

415
00:16:44.805 --> 00:16:46.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Because the amount of apple
that you've put in there,

416
00:16:46.645 --> 00:16:47.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it brings flavour.

417
00:16:47.685 --> 00:16:49.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Blending that with the raisin, the rum,

418
00:16:49.565 --> 00:16:52.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you have a beautiful,
traditional traybake.

419
00:16:52.325 --> 00:16:55.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not very sophisticated
but a real pleasure to eat.

420
00:16:55.205 --> 00:16:56.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[mouths] Thank you.

421
00:16:58.285 --> 00:16:59.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] I think they look very elegant.

422
00:16:59.525 --> 00:17:01.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You have kept it simple
-Yes.

423
00:17:01.165 --> 00:17:02.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it is down to that sponge.

424
00:17:04.325 --> 00:17:07.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the marzipan's a bit too thick
for that amount of sponge.

425
00:17:08.205 --> 00:17:09.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The sponge is very dry.
That's a shame

426
00:17:10.045 --> 00:17:10.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause they look great.

427
00:17:11.165 --> 00:17:12.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thank you very much for your
feedback. That's great.

428
00:17:14.685 --> 00:17:15.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] They look really elegant.

429
00:17:16.045 --> 00:17:17.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look all the same size.

430
00:17:17.685 --> 00:17:21.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very neat. Oh, lovely colour.
I love that pale green.

431
00:17:21.485 --> 00:17:23.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That comes from the pandan leaf,
doesn't it?

432
00:17:23.364 --> 00:17:24.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

433
00:17:26.364 --> 00:17:28.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the chiffon. That is lovely.

434
00:17:29.685 --> 00:17:31.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Textures are perfect.
The look of it is perfect.

435
00:17:32.124 --> 00:17:34.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But I just don't like the pandan.
-No, I accept that.

436
00:17:34.445 --> 00:17:35.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Some people don't.

437
00:17:35.525 --> 00:17:37.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] For me it's not the right flavour
to go in a traybake

438
00:17:37.485 --> 00:17:40.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I admire the fact that you did it
because that chiffon's perfect.

439
00:17:43.365 --> 00:17:44.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I really hope they taste okay.

440
00:17:45.045 --> 00:17:47.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So do I, um, 'cause they look hideous.
-[laughing]

441
00:17:47.365 --> 00:17:49.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] I know! I know. I'm sorry.

442
00:17:52.485 --> 00:17:53.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It's divine.
-Is it? Oh.

443
00:17:53.965 --> 00:17:54.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There you go.

444
00:17:56.205 --> 00:17:57.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Honestly, I don't care the way it looks.

445
00:17:57.805 --> 00:17:58.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Really?
-Yeah.

446
00:17:58.965 --> 00:17:59.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have to have another bite.

447
00:17:59.965 --> 00:18:01.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The almonds in there, the turron as well.

448
00:18:01.765 --> 00:18:04.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The whole thing together.
The orange. It's delicious.

449
00:18:04.205 --> 00:18:06.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Absolutely lovely.
-Oh, thank you.

450
00:18:06.445 --> 00:18:07.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can't believe I'm crying over a traybake.

451
00:18:07.885 --> 00:18:08.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

452
00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Well, I have to say
they look very elegant.

453
00:18:14.685 --> 00:18:15.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

454
00:18:15.605 --> 00:18:18.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not quite sure I'd like a whole
piece of rosemary leaf in my mouth.

455
00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:19.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

456
00:18:19.725 --> 00:18:21.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But you've got chopped rosemary
inside, haven't you?

457
00:18:21.725 --> 00:18:23.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, yes.

458
00:18:24.125 --> 00:18:26.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I'll tell you what, it's delicious
when you do get a bit of rosemary.

459
00:18:27.325 --> 00:18:30.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Italian meringue, it tastes fine,
it just needed more whipping.

460
00:18:30.285 --> 00:18:32.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chocolate goes well with it as well.

461
00:18:32.165 --> 00:18:34.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sponge is good but it's down
to those little elegant touches

462
00:18:34.565 --> 00:18:36.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I think you lost it slightly
with the Italian meringue.

463
00:18:36.485 --> 00:18:37.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

464
00:18:40.525 --> 00:18:42.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks like a forest floor.

465
00:18:42.525 --> 00:18:43.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] Okay.

466
00:18:44.085 --> 00:18:45.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's a mess. It's broken apart

467
00:18:45.725 --> 00:18:48.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
as you've tried to portion this
'cause some are thin, some are thick.

468
00:18:50.445 --> 00:18:52.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think as a chocolate cake goes
it's fantastic.

469
00:18:52.485 --> 00:18:53.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Ruby] Yeah.
-I mean very, very good.

470
00:18:54.005 --> 00:18:55.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The biggest issue is that
you don't get any cherry.

471
00:18:55.605 --> 00:18:56.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, okay.

472
00:18:56.565 --> 00:18:58.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Maybe more kirsch in there
would have helped as well.

473
00:18:58.725 --> 00:18:59.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Oh, I'm not sure about the kirsch

474
00:18:59.925 --> 00:19:01.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I could eat that
with a great deal of pleasure though.

475
00:19:01.605 --> 00:19:03.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, good. Phew.

476
00:19:08.285 --> 00:19:10.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, the decoration
is absolutely excellent.

477
00:19:11.325 --> 00:19:12.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything is very neat.

478
00:19:12.325 --> 00:19:15.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You pipe very well.
It's not too thick. Impressive.

479
00:19:15.365 --> 00:19:16.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

480
00:19:16.365 --> 00:19:18.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think they look amazing.
Good interior.

481
00:19:21.085 --> 00:19:22.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. Nice and boozy.

482
00:19:25.725 --> 00:19:26.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on. Say something nice.

483
00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:30.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Like your T-shirt.
-Just doing my best here.

484
00:19:30.845 --> 00:19:31.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That'll do.

485
00:19:31.845 --> 00:19:33.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, wow.

486
00:19:34.805 --> 00:19:35.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all applauding]

487
00:19:35.885 --> 00:19:36.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much.

488
00:19:37.205 --> 00:19:38.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What I like about it,

489
00:19:38.525 --> 00:19:39.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it looks incredible.

490
00:19:39.765 --> 00:19:42.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But when you get inside and you do hit
that cherry and the kirsch

491
00:19:42.645 --> 00:19:45.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
sits there and then the topping,
it's just a really nice cake.

492
00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:46.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I could sit and eat the whole lot.

493
00:19:46.805 --> 00:19:48.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's blushing. He's actually blushing.

494
00:19:49.165 --> 00:19:50.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am. [chuckles]

495
00:19:52.445 --> 00:19:56.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought he was joking, like, I was
waiting for him to go, "Just kidding."

00:19:56.365 --> 00:19:58.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] And I said I wouldn't cry

497
00:19:58.525 --> 00:20:00.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I did cry. [laughs]

498
00:20:01.005 --> 00:20:02.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They were tears of happiness though.

00:20:05.405 --> 00:20:07.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Claude Monet's favourite birthday treat,

You need to make a light
delicate pistachio genoise sponge.

00:20:52.845 --> 00:20:54.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:21:02.205 --> 00:21:03.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] That's a complete fluke.

[Sandi] You have two and a quarter-hours.

00:21:08.045 --> 00:21:08.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

527
00:21:10.325 --> 00:21:11.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, there's actually spinach.

528
00:21:11.445 --> 00:21:12.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought he was joking.

00:21:15.845 --> 00:21:17.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:20.525 --> 00:21:21.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In shock.

534
00:21:21.965 --> 00:21:23.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't even know what I'm making.

00:21:23.885 --> 00:21:26.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prue. Gâteau vert. Claude Monet cake.

536
00:21:26.605 --> 00:21:27.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What on earth are you thinking?

537
00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:30.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] One of the reasons
why I really love this cake

538
00:21:30.325 --> 00:21:34.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is because not only was it one
of Claude Monet's favourite cakes

539
00:21:34.285 --> 00:21:36.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but he had it every year on his birthday.

540
00:21:36.485 --> 00:21:38.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] So how does it get that
beautiful green colour?

541
00:21:38.725 --> 00:21:40.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's some spinach puree.

542
00:21:40.485 --> 00:21:43.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The thicker the puree, the more green
you can get into the fondant.

543
00:21:44.085 --> 00:21:45.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Those layers look amazing.

544
00:21:45.485 --> 00:21:48.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The most usual problem with genoise
is not getting the volume.

545
00:21:48.685 --> 00:21:50.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has to be at least an inch and a bit

546
00:21:50.365 --> 00:21:51.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so that you can cut it into three

547
00:21:52.205 --> 00:21:53.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it'll be light and delicious.

548
00:21:54.245 --> 00:21:55.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That is beautiful. This is about

549
00:21:55.725 --> 00:21:57.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the basics being done well

550
00:21:57.765 --> 00:22:00.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I think at this early stage
it's a fantastic challenge.

551
00:22:01.085 --> 00:22:04.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The person who keeps their head
will do the best

552
00:22:04.445 --> 00:22:05.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because there's a real danger of panicking

553
00:22:06.085 --> 00:22:07.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when you see how much you've got to do.

554
00:22:08.165 --> 00:22:11.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If Prue Leith says you've got to hurry,
I guess that means you've got to hurry.

555
00:22:12.045 --> 00:22:14.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Make the genoise sponge." Okay.

556
00:22:14.565 --> 00:22:17.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's actually my favourite sponge
to make. Fingers crossed.

557
00:22:17.565 --> 00:22:19.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Place the sugar and eggs
in a large bowl."

558
00:22:20.045 --> 00:22:23.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to whisk it for quite
a high speed, for quite a long time.

559
00:22:23.605 --> 00:22:26.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All of the lift comes from just
whisking the eggs.

560
00:22:26.205 --> 00:22:28.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So that's gonna be the tricky bit.

561
00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:32.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just gonna time it,
how long I'm going to whisk it.

562
00:22:32.525 --> 00:22:34.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I'll say about eight minutes.

563

00:22:38.885 --> 00:22:41.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Fold in pistachios and flour mixture,
butter and lemon zest."

565
00:22:42.285 --> 00:22:43.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't want to knock out any of the air.

566
00:22:44.005 --> 00:22:46.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What I take now is a little bit
of the genoise

567
00:22:46.125 --> 00:22:48.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and mix it in with the butter
'cause then I find it easier

568
00:22:48.525 --> 00:22:49.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to fold it into the rest of it.

569
00:22:49.765 --> 00:22:51.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just a bit concerned about this.

570
00:22:53.285 --> 00:22:55.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I know what I've done wrong.

571
00:22:55.645 --> 00:22:57.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It seems I should have done
something with this

572
00:22:57.885 --> 00:23:01.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I didn't and I don't know whether
I should have separated the eggs.

573
00:23:06.405 --> 00:23:07.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is not gonna go well.

575
00:23:10.645 --> 00:23:12.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I should have done the whites
separately I think.

576
00:23:15.365 --> 00:23:16.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Softly. Gently.

577
00:23:19.045 --> 00:23:22.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a question of whether I just
abandon ship or go back?

578
00:23:23.085 --> 00:23:24.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna go with it.

579
00:23:26.525 --> 00:23:27.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Karen] I'm trying again.

580
00:23:28.205 --> 00:23:29.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, starting from beginning.

581
00:23:32.485 --> 00:23:34.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It just says, "bake."

[Kim-Joy] I'm baking for ten minutes
initially then I'll check on it.

584
00:23:38.925 --> 00:23:40.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Think it'll be about 15.

585
00:23:40.685 --> 00:23:42.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Dan] I'm sure it'll need
at least 20 minutes.

587
00:23:44.405 --> 00:23:45.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's come back in 20.

588
00:23:46.565 --> 00:23:47.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eighteen minutes.

589
00:23:50.205 --> 00:23:51.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Right, bakers,
that's half an hour gone.

590
00:23:52.045 --> 00:23:53.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:33.845 --> 00:29:35.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] That is very nice.
[Paul] It does taste good.

723
00:29:36.205 --> 00:29:37.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's quite a rounded cake.

724
00:29:37.685 --> 00:29:38.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] How have they achieved that?

725
00:29:39.885 --> 00:29:41.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The layers aren't too bad.

726
00:29:44.125 --> 00:29:46.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flavour's okay. The filling's good
and the sponge is all right.

727
00:29:47.765 --> 00:29:50.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, this one looks quite nice
when you initially look at it.

728
00:29:50.285 --> 00:29:52.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The layers are equal.
The flavour's all right.

729
00:29:52.525 --> 00:29:53.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm. Mmm.

730
00:29:54.525 --> 00:29:56.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You seem to have lost
a couple of the layers here.

731
00:29:56.445 --> 00:29:58.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The crème au beurre,
seem to have lost some of it.

732
00:30:00.445 --> 00:30:01.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite stodgy, isn't it?

733
00:30:01.685 --> 00:30:02.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I think it's a bit overcooked.

734
00:30:03.365 --> 00:30:04.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[mouthing] Oh, my God.

735
00:30:04.445 --> 00:30:07.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Okay. I worry about this one.
First of all it's very thin.

736
00:30:07.805 --> 00:30:10.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've knocked all the air out
the genoise and the colour's wrong.

737
00:30:11.085 --> 00:30:12.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where are the layers?

738
00:30:13.045 --> 00:30:16.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Very rubbery.
Undercooked cake. That's sad.

739
00:30:17.645 --> 00:30:18.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I quite like the look of this.

740
00:30:19.045 --> 00:30:20.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I do too. It's very pretty.

741
00:30:20.885 --> 00:30:21.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The cake looks very good.

742
00:30:23.565 --> 00:30:26.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tastes of pistachio.
Really beautiful sponge.

743
00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:29.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I quite like this one as well.
It's got a bit of height to it.

744
00:30:30.965 --> 00:30:32.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a lot of icing on there.

745
00:30:34.965 --> 00:30:36.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The cake is lovely.

746
00:30:37.565 --> 00:30:38.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Right, moving onto the last one.

747
00:30:38.885 --> 00:30:41.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This looks bone-dry on the side
with the flooding of fondant on the top.

748
00:30:41.845 --> 00:30:43.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It is.
-It's a bit of a mess.

749
00:30:43.285 --> 00:30:44.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And it's, um, over-decorated.
-Yes, it is.

750
00:30:46.205 --> 00:30:47.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The sponge is quite light.

751
00:30:47.925 --> 00:30:49.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] But not very high.

752

it wasn't cooked.

00:31:13.565 --> 00:31:15.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

764
00:31:16.205 --> 00:31:18.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:18.845 --> 00:31:20.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

766
00:31:22.565 --> 00:31:24.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:26.925 --> 00:31:30.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

769
00:31:30.365 --> 00:31:31.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

770
00:31:31.285 --> 00:31:33.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:44.845 --> 00:31:48.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it's okay. I'm just quite

776
00:31:48.765 --> 00:31:51.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was technical and it was a challenge.

777
00:31:51.125 --> 00:31:53.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

time for your Showstopper challenge.

00:33:02.605 --> 00:33:05.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a chocolate collar cake.

803
00:33:06.245 --> 00:33:08.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cake can be any flavour that you like

804
00:33:08.845 --> 00:33:11.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it must be at least two tiers.

805
00:33:11.205 --> 00:33:13.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

all the way around the cake,

806
00:33:13.885 --> 00:33:15.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:15.765 --> 00:33:18.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:18.645 --> 00:33:20.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:29.725 --> 00:33:31.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's much hotter than chocolate
likes to be.

00:33:33.405 --> 00:33:34.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but unless you're a chocolatier,

816
00:33:34.885 --> 00:33:37.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you are not likely to make
a chocolate collar.

00:33:38.085 --> 00:33:40.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

about the tempering of the chocolate,

around the cake of their choice.

Fair play to you. That's a great job.

1135
00:48:02.605 --> 00:48:04.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, that's great to hear.
Thank you so much.

1136
00:48:04.365 --> 00:48:05.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't fault it.

1137
00:48:12.725 --> 00:48:13.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's simple and highly effective.

1138
00:48:13.965 --> 00:48:16.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got a great sheen
on that chocolate.

1139
00:48:16.085 --> 00:48:16.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I think it looks amazing.

1140
00:48:20.565 --> 00:48:23.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is tender. The pineapple
has made it very moist.

1141
00:48:23.485 --> 00:48:25.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the sponge is fantastically baked

1142
00:48:25.565 --> 00:48:27.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the coconut really
works with it as well.

1143
00:48:27.445 --> 00:48:30.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And I really love your design.
Very good.

1144
00:48:30.885 --> 00:48:32.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Well done.
-Thank you very much. Cheers.

1145
00:48:35.085 --> 00:48:37.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Luke, would you like to bring
up your Showstopper please.

1146
00:48:38.165 --> 00:48:39.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not really. [laughs]

1147
00:48:42.685 --> 00:48:43.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry about that.

1148
00:48:45.245 --> 00:48:47.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Cream in this sort of heat...
-Yeah.

1149
00:48:47.325 --> 00:48:48.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
White chocolate in this sort of heat...

1150
00:48:49.845 --> 00:48:52.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's see what it tastes like.
-It might taste wonderful.

1151
00:48:52.805 --> 00:48:53.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1152
00:48:56.085 --> 00:48:57.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour is delicious

1153
00:48:57.805 --> 00:48:59.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the cake is tough.

1154
00:48:59.565 --> 00:49:01.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll eat the raspberries
and cream all day,

1155
00:49:01.485 --> 00:49:02.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
especially with the white chocolate.

1156
00:49:03.125 --> 00:49:04.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Your sponge isn't good.
-Is it not good?

1157
00:49:12.965 --> 00:49:14.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's a nice-looking sponge.

1158
00:49:18.405 --> 00:49:20.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's going on?
Why wasn't this taken off?

1159
00:49:20.445 --> 00:49:22.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Manon] Basically,
my chocolate didn't set.

1160
00:49:22.605 --> 00:49:23.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it's set now.

1161
00:49:24.445 --> 00:49:26.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And now it's off, this chocolate

1162
00:49:26.325 --> 00:49:29.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is beautifully tempered
and absolutely shining.

1163
00:49:29.805 --> 00:49:31.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay.

1164
00:49:32.885 --> 00:49:34.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That's a very nice sponge.

1165
00:49:34.725 --> 00:49:37.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's a very, very nice cake.
Very smart.

1166
00:49:37.365 --> 00:49:38.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-That's a shame

1167
00:49:38.525 --> 00:49:39.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you didn't take the acetate off. [laughs]

1168
00:49:46.325 --> 00:49:48.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I have to say, I think the way

1169
00:49:48.405 --> 00:49:50.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you've done the iron work is brilliant.

1170
00:49:51.045 --> 00:49:54.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It may only be half the Eiffel Tower
but everybody knows what it is.

1171
00:49:54.245 --> 00:49:55.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-Okay.

1172
00:50:00.565 --> 00:50:02.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What I'm mostly getting is the sweetness

1173
00:50:02.805 --> 00:50:05.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of the buttercream
and the cake is a bit boring.

1174
00:50:06.965 --> 00:50:08.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1175
00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:10.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bad luck, Terry.
-No problem.

1176
00:50:10.405 --> 00:50:11.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Terry.
-You're welcome.

1177
00:50:18.165 --> 00:50:20.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We only asked you for two tiers.
-[Briony] Yes. I know. I know.

1178
00:50:20.645 --> 00:50:22.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So you did get collar round two.
-Yes.

1179
00:50:22.725 --> 00:50:23.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] We'll have a look at your
sponge now.

1180
00:50:26.365 --> 00:50:27.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul chuckles]

1181
00:50:27.845 --> 00:50:30.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, look at that. That is very beautiful.

1182
00:50:30.685 --> 00:50:31.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1183
00:50:34.965 --> 00:50:35.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your sponge is over-baked.

1184
00:50:36.125 --> 00:50:37.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can see by the colour on the outside,

1185
00:50:37.565 --> 00:50:39.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
how dark that is
and the others are like rubber.

1186
00:50:40.085 --> 00:50:43.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I agree with you that the texture
of the cakes are not right

1187
00:50:43.805 --> 00:50:45.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I think the flavours are lovely.

1188
00:50:45.605 --> 00:50:46.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Thank you.

1189
00:50:51.085 --> 00:50:53.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. It's a wonderful construction.

1190
00:50:53.845 --> 00:50:56.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm really impressed that you managed
to keep it together

1191
00:50:56.445 --> 00:50:57.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it hasn't all fallen down.

1192
00:50:57.925 --> 00:50:59.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Based on the weather today
and the heat,

1193
00:50:59.525 --> 00:51:01.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you've done an unbelievable job.

1194
00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:03.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not just to do two collars

1195
00:51:03.165 --> 00:51:06.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but to do these little pipework
across the top as well

1196
00:51:06.125 --> 00:51:07.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then do the shards on top of that.

1197
00:51:08.685 --> 00:51:10.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm impressed, Rahul.
-Thank you.

1198
00:51:12.365 --> 00:51:14.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can hear that crack. It's beautiful.

1199
00:51:16.325 --> 00:51:18.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Very bold, strong colours.

1200
00:51:22.485 --> 00:51:23.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fantastic.

1201
00:51:30.125 --> 00:51:31.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rahul, can you come here a minute please?

1202
00:51:32.085 --> 00:51:33.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1203
00:51:35.525 --> 00:51:36.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah!

1204
00:51:39.485 --> 00:51:42.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never given a handshake
for a Showstopper before.

1205
00:51:43.205 --> 00:51:44.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1206
00:51:44.125 --> 00:51:46.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is a fantastic cake.

1207
00:51:46.605 --> 00:51:47.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, Rahul.

1208
00:51:48.485 --> 00:51:49.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Well done, Rahul.

1209
00:51:59.005 --> 00:52:00.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It really is very elegant

1210
00:52:00.965 --> 00:52:02.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and very restrained.

1211
00:52:02.525 --> 00:52:03.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-It's classy.

1212
00:52:05.685 --> 00:52:07.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can just tell by the way
you're cutting it

1213
00:52:07.845 --> 00:52:10.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that the sponge is beautifully cooked.

1214
00:52:15.325 --> 00:52:17.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can sit here eating this
for an hour or so.

1215
00:52:17.765 --> 00:52:19.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. Phew.

1216
00:52:20.005 --> 00:52:21.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It's just delicious.
-Thank you.

1217
00:52:21.845 --> 00:52:23.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come here, Ruby.

1218
00:52:23.245 --> 00:52:26.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, yes! Yes! Yes!

1219
00:52:34.005 --> 00:52:34.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Woo.

1220
00:52:36.085 --> 00:52:38.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That cake. That sponge.

1221
00:52:38.285 --> 00:52:39.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour in there.

1222
00:52:39.565 --> 00:52:40.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The hazelnut and the chocolate.

1223
00:52:41.125 --> 00:52:42.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Every element comes through.

1224
00:52:43.205 --> 00:52:44.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perfectly.

1225
00:52:44.325 --> 00:52:45.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The collar is so elegant.

1226
00:52:45.725 --> 00:52:46.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The brittle on the top.

1227
00:52:47.045 --> 00:52:48.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a fine cake.

1228
00:52:48.365 --> 00:52:50.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, thank you. Oh, I'm made up.

1229
00:52:51.565 --> 00:52:52.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1230
00:52:53.365 --> 00:52:56.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When Prue said that she could sit there
and eat my cake all day long?

1231
00:52:56.645 --> 00:53:01.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Buzzing. I'm really happy
with Paul's handshake.

1232
00:53:01.285 --> 00:53:02.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would never take that back now,

1233
00:53:02.525 --> 00:53:04.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
like, I'm pleased that one's in the bag

1234
00:53:04.605 --> 00:53:07.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but... I wanted to impress Prue.

1235
00:53:08.245 --> 00:53:11.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Good job. Yay.
-[Ruby] Amazing.

1236
00:53:11.605 --> 00:53:12.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When Paul invited me to the table,

1237
00:53:12.765 --> 00:53:14.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just first thought that
maybe I have left something stupidly

1238
00:53:15.005 --> 00:53:18.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
inside the cake, you know, like,
I was poking it with a cocktail stick.

1239
00:53:18.645 --> 00:53:21.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe I left a cocktail stick inside
or something, so he wanted to show me.

1240
00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:23.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Yeah. That was very surreal.</i>

1241
00:53:24.285 --> 00:53:26.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There weren't any surprises. No.

1242
00:53:26.325 --> 00:53:28.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm surprised they even wanted
to judge it to be honest.

1243
00:53:29.045 --> 00:53:30.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know it's only a cake.

1244
00:53:30.565 --> 00:53:33.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The logical side of you knows
it's only a cake... [sniffles]

1245
00:53:33.405 --> 00:53:34.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And at the end of the day,

1246
00:53:35.365 --> 00:53:36.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's not the end of the world.

1247
00:53:36.725 --> 00:53:38.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It weren't as bad as mine at least.
-[both chuckle]

1248
00:53:39.045 --> 00:53:42.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at it that way.
At least you had a collar on it.

1249
00:53:42.805 --> 00:53:43.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both laughing]

1250
00:53:47.005 --> 00:53:48.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] <i>Prue and Paul must now decide </i>

1251

00:53:50.405 --> 00:53:52.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>and who will have to leave the tent. </i>

1253
00:53:52.645 --> 00:53:56.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was an extraordinary day
because we went in very clear

1254
00:53:56.085 --> 00:53:58.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
about the people who were in trouble

1255
00:53:58.245 --> 00:53:59.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and all that has changed.

1256
00:53:59.645 --> 00:54:02.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was so pleased with Ruby and Karen

1257
00:54:02.085 --> 00:54:04.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because they looked in such trouble.

1258
00:54:04.285 --> 00:54:07.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] <i>And Manon. I think those</i>
<i>three people saved themselves. </i>

1259
00:54:07.325 --> 00:54:09.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I think we've got Luke and Terry</i>
<i>down at the bottom. </i>

1260
00:54:09.445 --> 00:54:11.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Yeah, and they didn't even
look good, did they?

1261
00:54:11.285 --> 00:54:13.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Briony's Showstopper
wasn't particularly good.

1262
00:54:13.725 --> 00:54:15.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>She let herself down.</i>
<i>She's better than that.</i>

1263
00:54:15.565 --> 00:54:17.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] <i>The cake was stodgy.</i>

1264
00:54:17.405 --> 00:54:19.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think when you look into Star Baker,

1265
00:54:19.365 --> 00:54:21.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jon did a great job
with his pineapple cake.

1266
00:54:21.285 --> 00:54:23.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Rahul's done a fantastic job

1267
00:54:23.325 --> 00:54:26.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I also feel like Dan has been probably
the most consistent throughout all.

1268
00:54:26.325 --> 00:54:27.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely steady.

1269
00:54:27.405 --> 00:54:30.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>Quite amazing that</i>
<i>two handshakes happened. </i>

1270
00:54:30.765 --> 00:54:32.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never given a handshake
on a Showstopper before

1271
00:54:32.605 --> 00:54:35.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but to give two,
I'm disappointed in myself.

1272
00:54:35.285 --> 00:54:37.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[all laughing]
-But the only reason...

1273
00:54:37.885 --> 00:54:38.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're disappointed with you, too.

1274
00:54:38.965 --> 00:54:39.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I know.
-Yeah.

1275
00:54:41.365 --> 00:54:42.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[goat bleats]

1276
00:54:49.005 --> 00:54:53.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, what a tremendous
cake-fuelled weekend

1277
00:54:53.445 --> 00:54:54.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we have had

1278
00:54:54.565 --> 00:54:57.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I have the pleasure
of announcing the Star Baker.

1279
00:54:57.645 --> 00:55:00.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The person who is this week's Star Baker

1280
00:55:00.245 --> 00:55:02.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
made a giant of a traybake,

1281
00:55:02.365 --> 00:55:04.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
has been technically consistent

1282
00:55:04.685 --> 00:55:08.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and persuaded Paul to give his first ever
handshake in a Showstopper.

1283
00:55:09.325 --> 00:55:10.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rahul!

1284
00:55:10.405 --> 00:55:11.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all cheering and applauding]

1285
00:55:14.325 --> 00:55:17.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unfortunately, that means I get
to deliver the bad news.

1286
00:55:19.005 --> 00:55:22.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The person who's leaving us
this week

1287
00:55:29.325 --> 00:55:30.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is Luke.

1288
00:55:38.765 --> 00:55:40.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know. I know. Not my weekend, eh.

1289
00:55:41.845 --> 00:55:44.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just, like,
really gonna miss everybody here.

1290
00:55:44.925 --> 00:55:46.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, mate. Mate, I've lost my mate.

1291
00:55:47.085 --> 00:55:48.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Luke] I just can't believe
I've even made it

1292
00:55:48.525 --> 00:55:49.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
onto the show in the first place.

1293
00:55:49.725 --> 00:55:52.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just little old me,
who just like, bakes in his kitchen.

1294
00:55:52.165 --> 00:55:53.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Started with his nan.

1295
00:55:53.605 --> 00:55:55.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Taught himself.
But, hey, I still went in the tent.

1296
00:55:56.085 --> 00:55:58.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I still had Paul and Prue try food
I've baked,

1297
00:55:58.245 --> 00:55:59.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is like, literally a dream of mine.

1298
00:56:01.125 --> 00:56:02.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Next week. Next week...

1299
00:56:02.445 --> 00:56:04.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know. Next week. Get real.
I know. Thank you.

1300
00:56:04.165 --> 00:56:05.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] <i>I'm so relieved to still be here.</i>

1301
00:56:06.765 --> 00:56:10.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not gonna cry. Not gonna cry. Nope.

1302
00:56:11.565 --> 00:56:13.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I'm not. [laughs]

1303
00:56:14.565 --> 00:56:15.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still in it, Terry.

1304
00:56:16.685 --> 00:56:17.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still here.

1305
00:56:17.845 --> 00:56:19.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Terry] <i>Still in shock I think. </i>

1306
00:56:19.765 --> 00:56:21.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit surreal actually,
how much you do want it.

1307
00:56:22.805 --> 00:56:26.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will return home tomorrow and practice,
practice, practice.

1308
00:56:26.205 --> 00:56:28.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, Rahul. Cheer up, mate.

1309
00:56:28.165 --> 00:56:30.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I will try, yeah. Thank you.

1310
00:56:30.365 --> 00:56:33.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. Yeah, just my... Yeah,
my emotions goes a little bit crazy way.

1311
00:56:34.645 --> 00:56:36.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It feels so surreal,

1312
00:56:36.205 --> 00:56:38.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
like, Paul's handshake and Star Baker.

1313
00:56:40.765 --> 00:56:41.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

1314
00:56:42.725 --> 00:56:44.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just hope I didn't peak too early.
