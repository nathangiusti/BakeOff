It's all over the place, but it works.

507
00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very lemony.

508
00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Love the flavour, but very heavy.

509
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh! Goes down well with a cup of tea.

510
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn't turn it down
if someone offered.

511
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughing]
-But I'm judging it.

512
00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both laughing]

513
00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Looks like a lava flow.

514
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like it's just been through a city
and picked up buildings on the way.

515
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] There's the star, Jeff.
I can see it.

516
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Yeah.
-[Prue] Quite impressive.

517
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very strong lemon.
-[Paul] Almond comes through beautifully.

518
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your flavours are spot on,
but it looks such a mess.

519
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

520
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It took a little bit longer to cook
so I lost the cooling time.

521
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And the icing fell off.
-You've got an extra bonus cheeky drip.

522
00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] It looks lovely inside.
Lovely marble.

523
00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's a beautiful cake.
-Thank you.

524
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Nice and orangey.

525
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Only thing that lets you down
is your overall look.

526
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It doesn't look great, does it?
-No.

527
00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The vanilla ganache didn't set.
-[Prue] But the marbling's lovely.

528
00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the flavour.

529
00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Hmm.

530
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

531
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It hasn't got the height I wanted.

532
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I added the oil in later
than I usually would.

533
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] It sat on it.
-Yeah.

534
00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't dislike it.
I just think it could be better.

535
00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-One thing I like is the height.
-[Prue] Proper loaf.

536
00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is there a swirl? That's the question.
-Let's have a look.

537
00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] More of a splodge.
-[Prue] Yeah.

538
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] What I love is cherries are sour

539
00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you've imparted that into the sponge,
which is tricky to do.

540
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-Texture's perfect.

541
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flavour's lovely. Very good.

542
00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Thank you.

543
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Doing the Midlands proud.
-Of course, bab.

544
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Very neat. Got a good height.

545
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the little parcels on the top.

546
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Almost looks like meringue or…
-[Prue] Boiled eggs.

547
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-[Paul] Yes.

548
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not super confident about the sponge.

549
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yes, it feels a bit doughy.

550
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] When I was mixing the ingredients,
the yoghurt, I've missed today.

551
00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Quite dense.
-Yeah.

552
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flavour-wise, flavour's good,
but the bake is… not.

553
00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] I like the decoration. It's clever.

554
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got a drop in the middle.

555
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. I had to shake the cake
to get the apple to go down,

556
00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it's not gone all the way through.

557
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Miso's… Mmm.
I don't think it works for me.

558
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you get a piece of cake by itself,
it's really not very nice.

559
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] No.
-Needs the apple.

560
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need that sweetness
'cause it's quite sour.

561
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I like people working outside the box,

562
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it's a box I don't particularly like.

563
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's fair enough. It's a risk you take.

564
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you.
-Thank you.

565
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Alison] That's pretty, isn't it?

566
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The midwife in me was happy
at the release from the tin.

567
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like a smooth delivery.

568
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Like cutting the cord.
-Exactly!

569
00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] I'll think of it like that.
-[Illiyin] Do the honours.

570
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
mm. It's exactly like a cinnamon roll.

571
00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good.

572
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[gasps] Stop it. Stop it.
-[others gasp]

573
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Really nice. Well done.

574
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you! [laughs]
-Congratulations!

575
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On the birth
of your beautiful cinnamon cake.

576
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You deserve it.
-Thank you.

577
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Delicious.

578
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's really soft inside.
It's the cinnamon levels I love.

579
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gorgeous. I love the tin, the colour.

580
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just lovely.
-Well done.

581
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just melts.
-Thank you.

582
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Definitely trying that handshake one.
-I'll have another bit.

583
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Go on. [laughs]
-[laughs]

584
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps]

585
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What just happened? [laughs]

586
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know.

587
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a way to start.

588
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan] My heart broke
'cause Paul was like,

589
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"It's not my cup of tea."
It's not like you've got a second chance.

590
00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Andy] Firm, but fair, I'd say.

591
00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I won't take the wheels
off his car just yet. [laughs]

592
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It went surprisingly well.
I'm glad we're off to a good start.

593
00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] It wasn't disastrous,
but wasn't amazing.

594
00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need to know the technical
when it comes out to be able to smash it.

595
00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] <i>Each week, the bakers will face</i>
<i>a gingham-clad secret second challenge.</i>

596
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But this time,</i>
<i>there's an extra surprise awaiting them.</i>

597
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Welcome back, bakers.

598
00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As you can see, Jeff is not with us
'cause he's not feeling well,

599
00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but hopefully
he's gonna be back next week.

600
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, it's time for your first-ever
technical challenge.

601
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And this one has been set for you
by the one and only Paul J. Hollywood.

602
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's the "J" stand for?
-Juicy.

603
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

604
00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, as ever,
this challenge is judged blind.

605
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So before our judges leave, Paul,
have you got any advice for our bakers?

606
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You'll know the cake,

607
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the majority of the recipe
will rely on equal quantities.

608
00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ooh.
-[Noel] Okay. Off you pop, you two.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue, go back to your dressing room.
Paul, go back to your underground kingdom.

[all laughing]

611
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] Okay, bakers,
Paul would like you to bake

612
00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a batch of eight perfectly symmetrical
mini Battenbergs.

613
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Now the judges will be
looking for a light sponge

614
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
sandwiched in a silky buttercream,

615
00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
coated in apricot jam
and wrapped in marzipan.

616
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, you have two hours
and 15 minutes for this.

617
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But in a change from the norm…

618
00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a Taste and Bake challenge.

619
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Under your gingham cloth
is the perfect mini Battenberg.

620
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll have five minutes
to inspect your Battenberg,

621
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then you have to recreate that
with no recipe.

622
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

623
00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your five minutes start now.

624
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

625
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my gosh.

626
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh.
-[John] That's not homemade.

627
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan] Well, it tastes delicious.
But I don't know.

628
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never made a Battenberg before.

629
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've no idea what I'm doing.

630
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm happy. I looked
at a Battenberg recipe last night.

631
00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just trying to work out
how much sponge I need.

632
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think it's complicated
like a genoise or nothing like that,

633
00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'll go simple,
the same way I'd make a Victoria sponge.

634
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You use equal amounts.

635
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul said equal quantities,
so I'm just gonna go with that.

636
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Marzipan. How do I do that marzipan?

637
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I taste almond. Definitely almond extract,
but not too much of it.

638
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Illiyin] I've never made
marzipan in my life.

639
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was hoping to lift it up
and it's in a packet.

640
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the <i>Bake Off.</i> [laughs]

641
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[birds chirping]

642
00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think a Battenberg is
a tricky enough challenge as it is,

643
00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you've not even given them a recipe.

644
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it is the first time
we've given them an actual cake.

645
00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What you're aiming for.
-Yeah.

646
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When I mentioned equal quantities,

647
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the sponge, they should know
that the weight of the eggs, to the sugar,

648
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to the flour, etcetera,
are all gonna be the same.

649
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The jam, equal amounts of fruit to sugar.

650
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then icing sugar
and the ground almonds in your marzipan.

651
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where they could come unstuck,

652
00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you're looking for a marzipan that's
not overworked because it'll go oily.

653
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sticks to everything.
-It'll be sticky.

654
00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Secondly, the colour,
they're more pastel than radiant.

655
00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Enough talk. Can we eat?
-Choose your Battenberg.

656
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is beautiful.

657
00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Look at that. Cuts lovely.
-Mmm.

658
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Soft sponge. The marzipan's not too thick.

659
00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The colour is good
and the almond is spot on.

660
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mmm.
-Should be easy.

661
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It'll sort the sheep from the goats.
-[laughs]

662
00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, bakers, your time is up.

663
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On your marks.

664
00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get set.

665
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake.

666
00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>The bakers must now</i>
<i>hand back their Battenbergs</i>

667
00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and have just two and a quarter hours</i>

668
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is mad.

669
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't really know what I'm doing.
I'm making the sponges first.

670
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[John] All the cake is equal.

671
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've weighed the eggs,
so the same for butter, flour and sugar.

672
00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe I'm doing it completely wrong

673
00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and probably Paul gonna
hold his head like, "Oy, ya".

674
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] Christiaan,
you look in deep thought.

675
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't know what you're doing to me,
what Paul is doing to me.

676
00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] I'm here now.
You're a fashion designer.

677
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Could you make me a dress with no pattern?

678
00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you model for me,
I could make it on you.

679
00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So just make the cake on…
-On you?

680
00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Me.

681
00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Got almond essence.
It's on the table, so it's going in.

682
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] I'm gonna go in
with half a teaspoon.

683
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It can be quite strong.

684
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm just putting one.
Maybe not enough almondy.

685
00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Two. There we go.

686
00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hello. You got a handshake.
-I got a handshake.

687
00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What was that like?
-It's week one!

688
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've already won.

689
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You should've just walked out.
-In my eyes, I'm a winner.

690
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And then I saw Battenberg. [laughs]
-Ah.

693
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[John] I've split the batter now.

694
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm colouring one of them pink
to get the classic two-tone style.

695
00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Half pink, half yellow.

696
00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pink in one half, nothing in the other.

697
00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's get this in the oven.
This is a bit yellow.

698

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll make the jam now
'cause it needs to cool.

701
00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Weigh the fruit
and the same amount of jam sugar.

-[Noel] Is that how you make jam?

704
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just sugar and fruit in a saucepan?

705
00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm paying like 17 quid
at the farmers' market. Is that it?

-That's what you do?

707
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, that's that jam done.
That can cool.

708
00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In meantime, I'm gonna do the buttercream.

709
00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Buttercream's two to one
icing sugar to butter.

It's nice and smooth.

711
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like that.
It's nice and thin and even all round.

817
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Pretty neat.

818
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a good zing of apricot jam
and there's not too much almond essence.

819
00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice blend between the apricot and almond.

820
00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Moving on.
These haven't got enough yellow in there.

821
00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a bit too pale.
-Found it.

822
00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. [laughs] It's all in the cake.

823
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Wow, that's luminous.
The flavour's okay.

824
00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Tastes nice.
-[Paul] It's the overall look.

825
00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] This is very nicely shaped.
-[Paul] Colour's really strong.

826
00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A bit violent.
-But the inside looks really good.

827
00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] All the elements are good.

828
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] What is this?
-[Prue] It's a bit untidy.

829
00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's terrible.
Ends of the sponges haven't been trimmed.

830
00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This marzipan is not wrapped very well.
It's rather like loose packaging.

831
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Flavour's all right.

832
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These are a bit too small.

833
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] What happened
to the rest of the ingredients?

834
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The size is wrong.
The yellow's too bright.

835
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Marzipan's too thick.

836
00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oddly, that needs more almond.
-[Paul] A few issues with this one.

837
00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, moving on.
These are more green than yellow.

838
00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think the marzipan
got overworked. It's tearing.

839
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The apricot jam saves it.

840
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It does because the almond essence
is quite strong.

841
00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] This one needs to be worked
a little bit more to stop this cracking.

842
00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bit thick, but not too bad.

843
00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm, good flavour.

844
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] No colour in this.
-[Prue] They're very neat.

845
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Marzipan's a bit thick.

846
00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not enough sponge cake
and too much marzipan.

847
00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is just like having a marzipan…
-Yeah, marzipan sweet.

848
00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] These look nice.
-[Paul] Bit small.

849
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Almost petit four size, aren't they?

850
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't get much almond.
But nevertheless, they are neat.

851
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Moving on to these.
-[Prue] Messy, bit clumsy.

852
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Huge. Colours are good.

853
00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But needed more colour
on the actual Battenberg.

854
00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Good flavour. Nice and thin.
-[Prue] Very nice.

855
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Moving on. It's a little bit yellow
but the inside looks quite neat.

856
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Proportion of marzipan
to sponge is pretty good.

857
00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Very delicious.
-[Paul] Mm, it is.

858
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Battenberg used to be my favourite cake.

859
00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But after eating 11 of them,
I might never have another.

860
00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[all laughing]
-[Paul] Yeah.

861
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Me.

864
00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The marzipan was terrible.
It really did fall apart.

865
00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

866
00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hazel, they're a bit clumsy,
but they tasted good.

867
00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

874
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
John, it's a little lairy with the colour
on the marzipan, but it is very neat.

875
00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[John] So we're going, like,
a summery light blue, sunglasses on.

1222

I can go over it again,

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I wanna get the label
and stuff done first.

[Alison] Bakers,
you've got five minutes left.

1225
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just five minutes.

1226
00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Christiaan] Just a few last bits to do.

1227
00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the difficult bit.
This takes me forever to do.

1228
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] Need to tidy it up now.
She looks a mess.

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Aw. Thank you.

1232
00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just brush it with oil,
it's gonna give this very shiny shoes.

and it's over. Ugh.

1235
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's crazy.

1236
00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] This is sick,
it looks like a real bag!

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Alison] Only a few things would fit.

1239
00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yeah. And also… [laughs]

1241
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know what to say to that.

1242
00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

what to say to that, Andy.

00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have
one hyper-realistic minute left.

1244
00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, plenty time, even for a cup of tea.

1245
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1249
00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1250
00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:18.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1260
00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1261
00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It is so cute.

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The detail on it, the feathers, the eyes,

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And also the wood
round here. Beautiful.

1265
00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1267
00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which I put a bit of orange zest in.

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then a balsamic strawberry filling.

1269
00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's really clever.
You can see exactly what they are.

1274
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They do look the actual size.

1275
00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would've been nice if you got
the bowls completely spherical,

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I can see it's really hard.

1277
00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Gill] They are Irish cream sponge,

1278
00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Irish cream buttercream
and Irish cream caramel.

1279
00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:41.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That really works. I was worried it'd be
in everything and overwhelm.

1280
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But that is very, very good.

1281
00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It could easily have been
a boring chocolate cake,

00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's really interesting.
It's very dense in flavour.

1283
00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I think it's so impressive.

1285
00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It does look exactly like something
out of an Egyptian museum.

1286
00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1287
00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's clever, about the size
of the ones I've seen in the past.

1288
00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1291
00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought it won't work
because it'll be too soft.

1292
00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

You need more. Love the flavour.
You're just not getting the raspberry.

1302
00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1303
00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1304
00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-It is a bit of an art. [laughs]
-[Prue] Yes.

1308
00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The flavour?

1309
00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Chocolate and orange sponge
with olive oil and thyme,

1310
00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
orange curd and orange buttercream.

1311
00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm. Certainly get the thyme.

The cake's very, very firm.
So it's not the best to eat.

1314
00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.

1315
00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is massively overbaked.
It's bone dry. I don't like the flavour.

1316
00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's too sour.
It's a bit like the miso one.

1317
00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the design is exceptional.
It's a shame about the flavour.

1318
00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I think it's really amusing

1319
00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you've got
some of the detail beautifully.

1320
00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Great.

1321
00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could have done
a little bit more work on the fold.

1322
00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It cuts well.

filled with a margarita curd,

00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a coconut Swiss meringue buttercream.

1325
00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is lovely sponge.

1326
00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm.

1327
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Lovely. Really nice.

1328
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've managed to get that
margarita flavour, which is delicious.

1329
00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That's a really well executed cake.

1330
01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-The actual flowers are beautifully done.
-[Paul] I like the flowers.

1331
01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The vase itself,
it's the joins I can see too easily.

1332
01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The top's untidy.

1333
01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. The cake is double chocolate fudge,
peanut butter buttercream,

1334
01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
caramel and salted peanuts.

1335
01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cake's well-baked.
Flavours are amazing.

1336
01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I think the design is slightly flawed.

1337
01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hazel, would you like to bring up
your showstopper, please?

1338
01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wow.
-[Prue] Oh, my goodness.

1339
01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at that.

1340
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] Wow.
-[Hazel] There.

1341
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] You can see it's a bag.

1342
01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bag that's been used for many years
and has been kicked around a little bit.

1343
01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not very neat.

1344
01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cake's a little disappointing.

1345
01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit solid.

1346
01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Beautiful lemon flavour.
But sadly overbaked.

1347
01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I think it's exceptional.
Proper look of leather, love the zip.

1348
01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Looks so real, where you've got
the stitching and the zip.

1349
01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could just open it.

1350
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just brilliant.

1351
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It just has to taste good now, Andy.
-I hope so.

1352
01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's flavours from my childhood,
coconut sponge, raspberry jam

1353
01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's coconut buttercream
with a raspberry Chantilly.

1354
01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Before I've even tasted this,
it's overbaked.

1355
01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Didn't hear my timer go off,
I was too busy talking.

1356
01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, not you.
-[Andy] Yeah.

1357
01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it's really quiet, them little timers.

1358
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dee-dee-dee.
I thought I had tinnitus. It wasn't.

1359
01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It was that timer going off.
-[laughter]

1360
01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit firmer than it should be.
I tell you what,

1361
01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the filling is so good,
it's a lovely mouthful anyway.

1362
01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sharpness from the raspberry.
I love the flavour of that cake.

1363
01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] An absolute triumph.
-[exhales]

1364
01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Well done.

1365
01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[other clapping]
-[exhales] Thank you.

1366
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She's a slightly odd shape.
-Yeah.

1367
01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think she's lovely.
She's got a real personality.

1368
01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah. It does look good.

1369
01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The detail in the feathers has paid off.
What's in it?

1370
01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] Lemon curd, erm,
there's elderflower buttercream.

1371
01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] Look at that.
-[Prue] That looks pretty good. Wow.

1372
01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How does Fanny taste, guys?

1373
01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1374
01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Erm…

1375
01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's absolutely lovely.

1376
01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I prefer the sponge in the middle.
The others are too dense.

1377
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The middle one's perfect.
-That's the remade sponge.

1378
01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavour, I really like,
that lemon lightness to it.

1379
01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, she's not quite the right shape.
[laughs] But I think she's great.

1380
01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1381
01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

1382
01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

1383
01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mike, it's time for your showstopper.

1384
01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't drop it. [laughs]

1385
01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can pick them up
if you want to. [laughs]

1386
01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So good.
-Incredible.

1387
01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Aren't they beautiful?

1388
01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel I ought to be able to
flap through the pages.

1389
01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Mike] It's a bit bare.

1390
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue laughing]
-Haven't written them yet.

1391
01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] They look so like leather.

1392
01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are very good. Neat, rectangular.

1393
01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Beautiful.

1394
01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Mike] It's a chocolate sponge with
butterscotch Swiss meringue buttercream

1395
01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a butterscotch sauce.

1396
01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] That looks like
really nice, light cake.

1397
01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Did you add coffee to that?

1398
01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's meant to make
the chocolate a bit richer.

1399
01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It does what it says on the tin.
The butterscotch works beautifully well.

1400
01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
That's a beautiful cake, actually,
and a fantastic idea executed very well.

1401
01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ditto.

1402
01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs] Thanks, Prue.
-Lovely.

1403
01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Brilliant. Well done.
-[Mike] Thank you.

1404
01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

1405
01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm over the moon.

1406
01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think, in the time,

1407
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could have done much better
than what I've just done.

1408
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sniffles]

1409
01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:49.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think last in technical,
they have to be considering me to go home.

1410
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fair judging, yeah.
But, erm, I could be leaving.

1411
01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope not.

1412
01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can definitely say that Paul and me
do not have the same taste palate.

1413
01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I definitely think that I'm in danger.

1414
01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] Our first showstopper.
I think they did really well.

1415
01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They all did a great job.

1416
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who's in line for Star Baker?

1417
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sumayah's put herself in there.
-The duck.

1418
01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The skill was exceptional.

1419
01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think maybe John.
His flavours are just terrific.

1420
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Georgie won the technical.

1421
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Georgie did do really well.

1422
01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] That chicken, it was amazing.

1423
01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shape was a little odd,
but otherwise terrific.

1424
01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She did the individual feathers.

1425
01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's weird was Mike came in in trouble,
but Mike's books were incredible.

1426
01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think there was a couple of people

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

we decided not to send anybody home.
