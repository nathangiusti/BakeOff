111
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going with the 70% cocoa
solid chocolate inside the cake,

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then it's dark chocolate for the ganache
and dark chocolate for the mirror glaze.

209
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

she complains that a recipe isn't good.

212
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like, well, that's not the recipe.
You've just removed half the ingredients.

218
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

he's preparing for <i>Bake Off</i> all the time.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have half an hour.

307
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] Oh, assembly time.

308
00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] I don't want loads and loads
of cream here, 'cause it's very strong.

309
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Definitely has a kick.

310
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] I think it's done.

313
00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I can get it cool, I'll use it.

314
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I can't, I'm not using it.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's gotta go down a hell of a lot.

323
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

332
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's cold, thank God.

333
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna start putting it all together.

334
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This can be my middle layer.

335
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hopefully, you won't see it too much.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[David] Last week, right at the end,
I just rushed it,

338
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and Paul picked up on that.

339
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] Why are you doing this to me?

340
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just leaning.

341
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

342
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] Can you see my reflection?
Yeah, I can.

343
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] I think it's that middle layer.

344
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Trying to stay calm, but my heart
is like dum-dum-dum-dum-dum.

345
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

346
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] It's nearly there.

347
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] Maybe if I cover it in ganache,
they won't notice?

348
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] Whoa. It's kind of
stuck to the paper of the cake board.

352

to put it across anyway.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've made a million cakes in my life.

360
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's quite effective.

366
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

374
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

more than enough.

377
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it is delicious.

378
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think all your textures are beautiful,
but all you're getting is alcohol.

379
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

380
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a tiny little bit of it.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

382
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

383
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Chocolate ice cream, probably.

384
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
First impression, it's a bit wobbly.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it looks quite nice
and there is a bit of a shine there.

390
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a lot going on, on the top.

391
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

395
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

397
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The texture of the cake's lovely,
isn't it?

398
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm.

399
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very light.

400
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You didn't have, erm,
real chocolate in this,

401
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-did you?
-No.

402
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cocoa.

403
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do you think it could be more chocolatey?
-Yeah.

404
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm lacking the chocolate, actually.
-Okay.

405
00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because you've got maple,

406
00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because you've got a little bit of ginger,
because you've got pear,

407
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then you put cocoa in there,
it's a great cake.

408
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-But is it a great chocolate cake?

409
00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's delicious.

410
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it is a really good balance
between chocolate and pear and ginger.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My main problem with it
is actually the way it looks.

412
00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Not the way it tastes.

413
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Alice.
-Thank you very much.

414
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's very '70s.
It's a sort of old-fashioned cake.

415
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But that's what you were doing
and you've done it beautifully.

416
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's very elegant,
but let's have a look inside, shall we?

417
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Three pretty distinctive layers in there.

418
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yeah. Cherry jam looks beautiful.

419
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a black forest gateau.

420
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've certainly got
the chocolate there.

421
00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the cherries and the cream
work well together.

422
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a good balance.

423
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very crumbly, that cake.

424
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it is slightly overbaked,

425
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the flavour of the chocolate
is delicious.

426
00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a very nice cake, Steph.

427
00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay, thanks.
-[Paul] Very good.

428
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Steph] Thanks, guys.

429
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Slightly like, "Ugh, that's annoying."

430
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I always want it to be perfect.</i> [sighs]

431
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just got to remember to try and enjoy it.

432
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] <i>There was too much alcohol.</i>
<i>It would've been a hard thing to do,</i>

433
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but just be like,
"I'm just gonna do chocolate."

434
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe I should've done that.

435
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice]<i> The technical for the final,</i>

436
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
there's no theme this week.
It could literally be anything,

437
00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>which is terrifying.</i>

438
00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hope they don't throw
a massive curveball.

439
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>For our final three bakers,</i>
<i>the pressure is about to rise.</i>

440
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, bakers, welcome to your
very final technical challenge.

441
00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Today, it's been set for you
by the delight that is Paul.

442
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, any words of advice?

443
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On this challenge,
you have to be delicate.

444
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Okay, as ever, gonna have to ask
these two numpties to leave the tent.

445
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Off you pop, kids.
-Bye.

446
00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's you two. All right.
-Hello.

447
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckling]

448
00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

449
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing continues]

450
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry. I couldn't keep it up, Paul.

451
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing continues]

452
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, that was like a weird dream.

453
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, today, Paul would love you to make
six twice-baked Stilton soufflés.

454
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your soufflés need to hold their shape
when they're turned out of the mould,

455
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they need to be delicate
and fluffy in texture.

456
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And each one must be served with
a thin lavosh cracker.

457
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] You have an hour and ten.

458
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks...
-Get set...

459
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake.

460
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake!

461
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got a friend.
We were living in a flat together

462
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and he was looking for his soufflé dish

463
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it turned out
I'd used it as a plant pot.

464
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd no idea what it was.

465
00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's probably one
of the hardest technicals.

466
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very limited time, shaking like a leaf,

467
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
all the standard stuff.

468
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Help me.

469
00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, this is the final,

470
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you've given us
a twice-baked Stilton soufflé.

471
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

472
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I wanted something
that was gonna challenge them

473
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but also had a very classic feel to it.

474
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What we're looking for
are very proud, tall soufflés,

475
00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with a gorgeous golden-brown colour
coming from the cream and the parmesan.

476
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What could go wrong, then?

477
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] When you're making a soufflé,

478
00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
what you've gotta remember
is, er, whisking your egg whites.

479
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you don't whisk them enough,
it's not gonna carry the air,

480
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but, again, if you overbeat it,
you're gonna have a similar problem.

481
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Be delicate with that mixture.

482
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They could be underbaked
when we tip them out.

483
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Therefore, when they coat them
with the cream and the parmesan,

484
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you're gonna be coating a splat.

485
00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They need to concentrate
and watch their ovens.

486
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a bigger piece for you there, Prue.
-[Prue] I'm a bigger girl.

487
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul laughing]

488
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you see the air holes in it.

489
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite a stable structure as well.

490
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then you have
these gorgeous lavosh biscuits

491
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which are really wafer-thin.

492
00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A few bubbles all over it,
and a great snap as well.

493
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm hoping we're gonna
come up with something

494
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that at least tastes good.

495
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, I think they'll be lovely.
-[Paul chuckles]

496
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think this is first, isn't it?
Make a roux.

497
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] A roux is what people think of
if they're making a white sauce.

498
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's used as the base of a soufflé.

499
00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] You melt your butter,
add your flour.

500
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hope the roux will thicken.
We can hope.

501
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just don't know how thick it should be.

502
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't wanna overdo it.

503
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So this is now getting
quite nice and thick.

504
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just don't think I've done this right.

505
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] What's the matter?
-I just don't know if this is right.

506
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is this is a roux?
-[Sandi] Have you never made a roux?

507
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really? You've never
made lasagne, fish pie?

508
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Any of those things?

509
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sauce, béchamel sauce, no?
-[Alice chuckles]

510
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[speaks indistinctly]
-Lovely weather we're having, isn't it?

511
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] Right.

512
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Add parmesan, mustard, chives and thyme.

513
00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] Forty grams of this bad boy.

514
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] I'm just gonna give the thyme
a bit of a chop and a bash.

515
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I haven't got time for this.

516
00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] Beat in egg yolks,
mix in Stilton and seasoning.

517
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] In it goes.

518
00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tasty? Tasty goodness.

519
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Steph] Hmm.
-[Noel] It's like an advert from the '70s.

520
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Steph] Yeah.
-Mmm, tasty goodness. [chuckles]

521
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Let's have a taste.
-[Alice] Go on then.

522
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh.
-Oh, tasty goodness.

523
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Steph] Okay, great, that's brilliant.
-Yeah.

524
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, I need to whisk my egg whites.

525
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] A soufflé doesn't have
any raising agents,

526
00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so all of the oomph
comes from the egg white.

527
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] It's not looking great.
A few lumpy bits in there.

528
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have this quite a lot.
I think I overwhip my egg whites.

529
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] It's like a stiff peak, I think.

530
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does that look all right?

531
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

532
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna... Yeah,
I'm gonna leave it like that.

533
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks quite airy.

534
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have to get them in the tins, I think.

535
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know how much to put in here.

536
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is not a one-oh-one
on soufflé-making.

537
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How much should I put in, Noel?

538
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Er...

539
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, God.
-[David] You never put all in

540
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-'cause it would overflow.
-I've got nothing.

541
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're gonna rise, aren't they?
That's the thing.

542
00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it doesn't wanna be too much.

543
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Doesn't wanna be too much
'cause then they'll go pfft!

544
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Mushroomy.

545
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a wing-it situation.

546
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Think I need to probably fill it.
-[Alice] I need a bit of space at the top.

547
00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are gonna rise up.

548
00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fingers crossed.

549
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

550
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This one looks like it's
run out of all the airiness,

551
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so shame for this little runt,

552
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but this'll be me
in the family of soufflés.

553
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake using a bain-marie.

554
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cold water or hot water?

555
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] Hot water in a tray in the oven.

556
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] Hot water in the bain-marie.

557
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] Just going for cold water.

558
00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] They're ready for the first bake.

559
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] Right, they're going in.

560
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] I hope it rises.

561
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[timer beeping]
-I don't know what is gonna happen.

562
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, what have I gotta do now
'cause I feel like I'm way behind.

563
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you are halfway through.
Halfway through.

564
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've not got long to double-bake these
and make the crackers.

565
00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, I'm making the dough.

566
00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it kinda sounds really crispy

567
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and actually really delicious,
so I'm happy to make one of these.

568
00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Plain flour, wholemeal flour,
olive oil, salt and water,

569
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but doesn't tell you how much water.
-[David] Roll the dough until paper-thin.

570
00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do we think this is paper-thin?
-[David] Now is this paper-thin?

571
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, that is paper-thin, darling.
You could...

572
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-That's like parchment.

573
00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could write the dead sea scrolls
on that.

574
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd rather do that, than bake soufflés.

575
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right. Twelve equal triangles.

576
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do we do this?

577
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] One thing that is never
my strong point is maths.

578
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm just gonna make a template.

579
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God.

580
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't wanna cut too much off.
So one, two, four... [frustrated sighs]

581
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How's David got so much?

582
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, these are too small now.

583
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[groans] Oh, this is a nightmare.

584
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have 15 minutes.

585
00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] I don't know that
these are gonna be ready,

586
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I'm gonna have to do it now.

587
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think they feel solid enough
to actually take them out now.

588
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] I think I'm gonna have to try
and take them out.

589
00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Turn the soufflés out onto a baking sheet
and leave to rest.

590
00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my goodness.

591
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God.

592
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think this is gonna come out.

593
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got no choice.

594
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's something.
Okay. Keep going, keep going.

595
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] Oh, that one got
a bit of bottom on it.

596
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm-mm.

597
00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a palaver.

598
00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] Oh!

599
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, cold water in the bain-marie
was not a good idea.

600
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is a bit embarrassing really,
isn't it?

601
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, dear.

602
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales] Pray for me.

603
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

604
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, like, do we keep going?

605
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[crying] I just feel a bit stupid.

606
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Bakers, you have...

607
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Five minutes left
to complete your Stilton soufflés.

608
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] God, this was really mean
with timings.

609
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the second bake but look,
it's a disaster.

610
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] Let's see.

611
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is horrific.

612
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, dear.

613
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is going in there as well.

614
00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] These should take,
like, a minute to bake.

615
00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's nowhere to put them but...

616
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't fit 'em in, can I?

617
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] Bakers...
-You have one minute left.

618

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

625
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Noel] <i>Prue and Paul are looking</i>

[Paul] We'll start with these.
These are risen, a little bit...

633
00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Pale.
-pale. And the biscuits are a bit floppy.

634
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue] Yeah.

635
00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The soufflé's got a little bit
of bounce to it.

636
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It could've done with longer in the oven,
but there is some substance there.

637
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, it's stable enough.

638
00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you can tell right in the middle,
there, it's underbaked.

639
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Good flavour.

640
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Texture's too gluey.

641
00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

642
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would eat it with a great deal
of pleasure. But this is the final.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

646
00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

647
00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] That's hardly been
in the oven. Look.

648
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yeah.

649
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They've had problems
with the soufflé from the start.

650
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They've beaten the whole thing to death.

651
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because those ingredients
are so delicious, it tastes lovely.

652
00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's like eating a sauce.

653
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Now, these look fairly substantial.

654
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-[Paul] There is a break.

656
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Paul] They're not bad.

657
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue] Yeah.

658
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
-[Paul] And they are baked through.

659
00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very much better,
but they're still not a perfect shape.

660
00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

674
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

they're a little bit uneven,

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

678
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

about the entire series

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

was literally the Armagnac.

Today, the judges would like you to make
a deliciously deceptive feast,

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your feast must contain elements
made from cake,

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

one kind of food but look like another.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, basically, we're testing the theory
that we actually eat with our eyes.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have four and a half hours.

744
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's so many elements today.

745
00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gonna be absolute carnage in here.
Absolute carnage.

746
00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] Bread's gonna look like a cake,
and then the cake's gonna look like bread.

747
00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gonna be all sorts

755
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Steph] This is my lemon and poppy seed.

824
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Quite a lot of lemon zest,
so just gonna zest for our lives.

825
00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, we've reached the final, Prue.

826
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's gonna be fascinating
to see what they come up with.

827
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] I'm thinking of speed today,
so this is kind of an all-in-one mix.

828
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a bit worried about Alice.

829
00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's worried about whether her parents
will get on that plane.

830
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She needs to just concentrate on the plan
and keep baking.

831
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So these are lemon spice drops.

832
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So instead of having to
sit and zest a lemon,

833
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you can put these in,

834
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it gives
a really intense lemon flavour.

835
00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think David seems to be
in a much calmer place.

836
00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Yeah. Always looks as if
he's enjoying himself, doesn't he?

837
00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He does seem the most chilled
out of the three.

838
00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] Doesn't taste lemony enough,
so must need more lemon.

839
00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I just really want
all three to do well

840
00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because if you just crash out,
it's horrible.

841
00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I totally agree.

842
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh!

843
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's only gonna be one champion.
Who's it gonna be?

844
00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No idea at the moment.

845
00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, me neither.

846
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These are going in.

847
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it tastes of lemon. I don't know.
I think I'm gonna have to go with it.

848
00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

849
00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] Okay, right, let's clear
some stuff out the way.

850
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

851
00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

861

865
00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Well, I'll make sausage rolls."

868
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

869
00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Alice] This is what I'm gonna mould
my nougatine around.

927
00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] This has gone really badly
in practice,

928
00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so, I just feel like this is gonna be
a disaster.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] It's a bit skew-whiff,

Ugh. How do you do this?
I didn't make a handle at home.

931
00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

932
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

933
00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ooh, I should probably do it
a different way.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] I mean, this is not a hamper.
I don't think a handle's gonna happen.

935
00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] Just burnt myself
a couple of times,

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

It's not a criticism,
but I think we took a slight wrong turn.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My macarons gonna go in
for about 12 to 14 I think.

950
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

951
00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

they hold their shape,

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

This one, however,
needs to look like a porkpie.

973
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

992
00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

997
00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

998
00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's so lovely to see everyone.
We just need the last three out now.

1030
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My money's on... [exhales heavily]

1031
00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Essex. I'm rooting for Alice.

1032
00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For the boys, I'm gonna back Dave.
Big Dave.

1033
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michelle] <i>David is so knowledgeable.</i>

1034
00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To bring home the win today,
that'd just be magical for him.

1035
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Steph's just obliterated that tent,
hasn't she?

1036
00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know. I don't know.
I... I couldn't call it today.

1037
00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Any three of them totally worthy.

1038
00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, argh, I don't know.

1039
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All of them. I choose all of them.
They're all my winners.

1040
00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>It's judgment time</i>
<i>for the showstopping</i>

1041
00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>edible picnic illusions.</i>

1042
00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Alice, please bring up your showstopper.

1043
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not as strong as I thought I was.
[chuckles nervously]

1044
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that's exceptional.
Quite an impressive illusion.

1045
00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. The scotch eggs, you do believe
that that's egg.

1046
00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's amazing. The only thing that fail
a little on the illusion side

1047
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
are the ice creams.

1048
00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're very good.
They just don't look totally convincing.

1049
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Let's have a look at the buns.

1050
00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think it really works

1051
00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause blueberries
don't have much flavour,

1052
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but they do look absolutely perfect.

1053
00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] And these are?
-[Alice] Carrot cake scotch eggs.

1054
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, the egg is a lemon cream cheese
and then a lemon curd yolk.

1055
00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Lemon comes through a little bit.
-Hmm.

1056
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Good carrot cake there.
-Mmm.

1057
00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I think that's exceptional.

1058
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The illusion works,
it's funny and it tastes nice.

1059
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] And these are the little macarons?

1060
00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] You only got one strawberry-shaped.

1061
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did have a few issues
with the macarons. [chuckles]

1062
00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue chuckles]

1063
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's really strong flavour,
really fresh fruit.

1064
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Right, what is this?

1065
00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's orange and cardamom.

1066
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Love that. A lot of zest coming off that.
-Mmm.

1067
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A lot of zing. It's a good texture as well
for an enriched dough.

1068
00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very clever,
and I do like the taste of them.

1069
00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thank you very much, Alice.
That's a pretty good effort.

1070
00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Thank you very much. Thank you.

1071
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
David, please bring up your showstopper.

1072
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it looks amazing.

1073
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stunning. The basket is great.

1074
00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's even got mine
and Prue's initials on it.

1075
00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The fig rolls have worked really well
as sausage rolls.

1076
00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that cheese looks incredible.

1077
00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So, what shall we start with? The peach?
-[Prue] Yeah, let's start with the peach.

1078
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that looks lovely.

1079
00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like. That's really clever.

1080
00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the saffron does work well.

1081
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[David] Yes!
-And it took the final to get there.

1082
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The texture's excellent as well,

1083
00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the fruit just sets it off
with a little bit of zing as well.

1084
00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the flavours are very interesting.
But I think they're too chewy.

1085
00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Shall we try your fig rolls,
or sausage rolls?

1086
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. Very nice.

1087
00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's very good as well.
-[Prue] And they look fantastic.

1088
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah, they do.

1089
00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The texture's so soft on the mouth

1090
00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with the fondant and with the buttercream
as well all together.

1091
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is really delicious.
-[Prue] It's really delicious.

1092
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've come up with something
that is very very clever,

1093
00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you've gone to the extra bit
of making the biscuit base

1094
00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the fondant, the tablecloth,
the chutney.

1095
00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the whole thing together
is exceptional.

1096
00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bravo.

1097
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1098
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nailed it.

1099
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Phew.

1100
00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Steph, would you like to bring up
your showstopper, please?

1101
00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Apart from the basket having had
a few problems,

1102
00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the look of the burger.

1103
00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I would definitely think
that was made of bread.

1104
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think there's obviously been
a few issues today.

1105
00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bun topping is not right.

1106
00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the strawberries, you need to get
the glisten on the top of them.

1107
00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bun I like,
and that looks pretty good.

1108
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice hot cross bun.

1109
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Delicious. Love the spice.

1110
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Need to prove a little bit more.

1111
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a little bit tight inside.
-[Steph] Hmm.

1112
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Those are not round enough
for strawberries. They're a bit flat.

1113
00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[smack lips] My, you've got a kick
to that Chantilly, haven't you?

1114
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] What's in there?

1115
00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Steph] Cherry liqueur.
-It's a little bit overwhelming.

1116
00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1117
00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel whispers] Wow.
-[Paul laughing]

1118
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That is really good.

1119
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] That's great.
-[Paul] Clever.

1120
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very clever.

1121
00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not much flavour to that.

1122
00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-[Paul] Could've done with more lemon.

1123
00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a little bit overbaked as well.

1124
00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never mind, Steph.

1125
00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much indeed.

1126
00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:02.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph sniffles]

1127
00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:09.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

1128
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph chuckles]

1129
00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Doesn't matter, all right?

1130
00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles and sniffles] I know. Thanks.
-You did a good job.

1131
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
