Hello, comedian and artist Noel Fielding.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not especially.
I've never even had a dessert before.

5
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't eat. Tragically,
I was born without a mouth.

[Amanda] It's Dessert Week!

31
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So excited.

33
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] First thing I look at
in a restaurant is the dessert menu.

34
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got proper sweet…

35
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got sweet <i>teeth,</i>
not a sweet tooth. [chuckles]

36
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am really nervous of a vegan
substitute for this week.

37
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Definitely not as easy to use.

38
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
People were like,
"Why don't you just bail out?"

39
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was like,
"No, stick by your morals." [chuckles]

40
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My friends will probably say,
"What does Maggie know about desserts?"

41
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"She never eats them."

42
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The truth of that
will be in the eating later on.

43
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Good morning, bakers, and welcome back
to the tent for Dessert Week.

44
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For your Signature challenge,
the judges would love you

45
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to make a beautifully decorated pavlova.

46
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] Your pavlova
can be any flavour you like,

47
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it should be perfectly baked
with a crisp outer shell

48
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and have a soft, pillowy centre.

49
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both] Mmm!

50
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have two hours and 45 minutes.

51
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks.
-Get set.

52
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake!

53
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lizzie] I don't really eat pavlovas.

54
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sticky toffee pudding I'm about.

55
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got to feel
like you've ate something.

56
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Egg whites, innit, and sugar? [laughs]

57
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What can go wrong?

58
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] What we're looking for
in a pavlova is a crispy exterior

59
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and a little chewy
marshmallow texture inside,

60
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
filled with whatever they wish.

61
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To get the texture right,
you need to bake it for an hour,

62
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
turn the oven off and leave it cooling
for as long as possible.

63
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The hard part of this is getting
the bake right in the meringue.

64
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They could crack, they could bead, melt,

65
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
allow water to come out
or, indeed, collapse.

66
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The middle is always the most difficult.

67
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bottom needs to be firm enough
to support the fillings

68
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
without becoming squishy.

69
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a pretty tricky challenge.

70
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's 101 different reasons
why meringues will fail.

71
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And to do it in two hours 45
makes it even harder.

72
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hi, Giuseppe.
-[Giuseppe] Good morning.

73
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tell us about your pavlova.

74
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's called "Every Day at the Beach,"
inspired by one of my childhood memories.

75
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it's going to be peaches and coconut.

76
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

77
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

78
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

79
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So delicious.

80
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a basic meringue.

84
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it at too high temperature and it cracked.

85

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

242
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm putting charoset on.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll blitz them up, whip up some cream,

309
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
fold it in and then pipe.

[Amanda] This is my chocolate mascarpone.

311
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Raspberry coulis.

312
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hopefully it don't make it all mushy.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[George] I think Paul and Prue might have
something to say about this presentation.

314
00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Always going on about presentation,
aren't they?

315
00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd love it if one day you just went…

316
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

"See you later, guys."

318
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lizzie] I think the colour's lovely,
I don't know if it's appetising.

319
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

321
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah!

322
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

323
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just painting my matza.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Maggie] I'm putting frozen fruit on top.
Hopefully, it won't leak out.

325
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This here is the mango
and the blueberries.

326
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Freya] That's cute.

327
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] Kiwis flying everywhere.

328
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

329
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that's it.

330
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Please step away
from your pavlovas.

331
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, I believe
the plural is "pavlovi."

332
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Happy?
-Yeah, chuffed to bits.

333
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It sunk and there's some cracks.
It's a pavlova.

336
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Hi, Crystelle.
-Hello.

337
00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Hi, Crystelle.

338
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Looks great.
-Those little egg shapes are lovely.

339
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I've got a coconut streusel base,
a lime curd, and then fresh Kiwis.

340
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Delicious.

341
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really strong lime
which goes beautifully with the meringue.

342
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sides are too thick.

343
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got, like, an impenetrable wall
you've gotta get through.

344
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But flavours are great though.
-[sighs] I'll take that.

345
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have the pyramids in matza.

346
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So, just the basic pavlova, then.
-[Jürgen] Just the basic pavlova.

347
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The idea is very good.
It's a little untidy. It's cracked a bit.

348
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That is so unusual.

349
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You get the dates first
and then the orange.

350
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a great blend of flavours,
and it works in that pavlova.

351
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would have thought it wouldn't have
enough acidity, but it does.

352
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jürgen's back.

354
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mazel tov.

355
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

356
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] I mean, it's not the most
attractive looking pavlova.

357
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-'Cause that green is… [laughs]
-[Prue] It looks…

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lizzie] It is blueberry, rosemary,
and lemon curd.

359
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like something
out of a Willy Wonka Factory.

360
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Yeah.

361
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the rosemary. Very good lemon curd.

362
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavours are spot-on.
I just think it's a bit stodgy.

363
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Love the appearance.
Has cracked a little bit.

364
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would have put more raspberry,
less chocolate.

365
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] The chocolate is so dominant.
-Okay.

366
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] George, I think it looks awful.
-Okay.

367
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The baking hasn't worked either.

368
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That idea of putting it in the proving
drawer to get that sort of crack in there.

369
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all marshmallow, isn't it?
You need to hollow it out more.

370
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[George] Okay.

371
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The speculoos with the lemon.
-Absolutely delicious.

372
00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not all bad news. Thank you.

373
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-I think "informal" is a good word to use.
-Exactly.

374
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Higgledy-piggledy.

375
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Structurally, it's lost its way.

376
00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's collapsed a little bit on the side.
-[Maggie] Yes.

377
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavours are lovely.
I think it does look a bit of a mess.

378
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks really summery and delicious.

379
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think you could've baked it
a little bit longer.

380
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Because of that.
-[Giuseppe] Yes.

381
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's broken away.

382
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. Flavours are so fresh and summery.

383
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The peachy cream is just delicious.

384
00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah. Thank you.
-[Prue] Well done.

385
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-[Prue] Looks fantastic.
-Decoration looks very good.

386
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But…
-Oh, gosh.

387
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The proof is literally in the pudding.

388
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Wow, it's like an Eton mess.

389
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The aquafaba doesn't hold up well at all.

390
00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] They're not very strong flavours.

391
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're not tangy or tart enough.
-[Freya] Okay.

392
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you get a slice
of the candied peach, it's good.

393
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the, sort of, sloppy bit
in the middle, that's not very nice.

394
00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] That looks amazing.
-[Prue] I love the edge.

395
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just so casually, but elegantly swirled.

396
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beautiful. All right, let's have a look.

397
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That just falls through.

398
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you excited?
-I am.

399
00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's for you.
-[Prue] Oh, look at that.

400
00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's filled with Chantilly cream
and a mango and passion fruit coulis.

401
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's lovely, soft,
but stable in the middle.

402
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And crunchy outside.

403
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's wonderful.

404
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The acidity and the cream is just lovely.

405
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] There's a nice marshmallow
in there, its stable enough to hold it.

406
00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite difficult to get that balance.

407
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the way you've done the top
and the chocolate, I can't, you know…

-[Matt] Wow.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-No, no, not at all.

413
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] I can't believe it.
Hollywood handshake.

414
00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My work here is done now. [chuckles]

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul said, "Jürgen is back,"
so I take that comment.

416
00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's great.

417
00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need to do well
in Technicals, definitely.

418
00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Going to go in with a positive attitude
and do my best.

419
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All still to play for in Dessert Week.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

422
00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, welcome back to the tent
for your Technical challenge,

423
00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which, today, has been set
by the evil Prue-Ella De Vil.

424
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This recipe requires
some serious multitasking,

425
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so get organised.

426
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[grunts] Shivers up my spine.

427
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As ever, this task is judged blind,
so we ask the judges to leave the tent.

428
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For your Technical challenge,
Evil Prue would like you each to make

429
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
four individual sticky toffee puddings.

430
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your sticky toffee puddings
need to be perfectly baked

431
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and served with sticky toffee sauce.

432
00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Would've thought that was obvious.
-You would've thought so.

433
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your sticky toffee pudding
should be decorated with tuile triangles

434
00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and served alongside
a smooth crème anglaise.

435
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both] Mmm…

436
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] You have 90 minutes.

437
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] On your marks…
-Get set…

438
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bake!
-[Crystelle sighs]

439
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckling] Why?

440
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales heavily]

441
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love sticky toffee pudding.
It's great, isn't it?

442
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amanda] My husband makes
the sticky toffee pudding at home.

443
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's his thing.

444
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I never have to make it.
Now I wish I had.

445
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never, ever made one. [chuckles]

446
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll see how it goes.

447
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This may be… I never have before,
maybe never, ever again.

448
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] So, sticky toffee pudding.
-Who doesn't like a sticky toffee pudding?

449
00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite a complicated challenge.

450
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They have to make the pudding,
they have to make caramel sauce,

451
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the crème anglaise
and they have to make tuile.

452
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course, the sponge
is the most important thing.

453
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The problem might be that they'll think
it's cooked when it's not.

454
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So the danger is slightly undercooking.

455
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, that is a lovely light sponge.

456
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can see it's baked all the way through
with that beautiful caramel on the top.

457
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Crème anglaise is beautifully smooth,
and it's that blend between the two.

458
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The whole lot is lovely together.

459
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure a couple of 'em
will get it spot-on.

460
00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think we'll have any disasters.

461
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This recipe
seems quite brief and complicated.

462
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] I'll make the tuile first,
which I've never done before.

463
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's a really thin,
skinny biscuit.

464
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Tuile"? Tuile? Tules?

465
00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Cook the butter,
lemon juice and liquid glucose…"

466
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Remove from the heat
and stir in the dry ingredients…"

467
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[George] Right. Hazelnuts,
sesame seeds, flour, butter…

468
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this right?

469
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

470
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got to let it rest.
I am now on… Make toffee sauce.

471
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sauce is the best part, hands down.

472
00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Make a wet caramel,
then add the cream, butter and vanilla."

473
00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To make a wet caramel…

474
00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Does that mean
that you put water in the caramel?

475
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[nervously] I don't know.

476
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] Hot water
speeds up absorption of liquid.

477
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] Gotta wait for this now
to go to a nice golden colour.

478
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] It is starting to brown.

479
00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Giuseppe] Now is the fun part,
pouring the cream.

480
00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's coming, but there's some
lumps of crystals in there.

481
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[George] This is gonna burn.

482
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need to add some vanilla
to take out the burning smell.

483
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amanda] Doesn't look
very caramelly, does it?

484
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exclaiming] Ah! Oh, no.

485
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

486
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] Should bake my tuile,

487
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I'll need
the oven for the pudding.

488
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Spread the tuile mixture into a rectangle.

489
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not really a rectangle, is it?

490
00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[beeps]
-[Jürgen] Tuile is in.

491
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is no guidance whatsoever.
The point there is, "Bake."

492
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh!

493
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, no, she died.
Do you think I can just use it?

494
00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fine. They won't know. [chuckles]

495
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no. Today's just not my day.

496
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

497
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, half of you are halfway through.

498
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The other half have half a challenge left.

499
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're halfway through.

500
00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, this is coming out.

501
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maggie] Come on.

502
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, we let this cool a little bit
and then I'll cut it.

503
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the next step
is to make the pudding batter.

504
00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got the chopped dates,
the self-raising flour,

505
00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
butter, dark muscovado sugar…

506
00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And butter. I said butter already.
And chopped dates.

507
00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got some butter and sugar in here.
I'm not sure if I need the flour.

508
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have my doubts, somehow.

509
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll just read the recipe again.

510
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Maggie.
-[Maggie] Hello.

511
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] I'm gonna write number 11.

Number 12,

Now, when they ask you about the recipe,
go, "What are these?"

-[George] What's next?

518
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got butter on my face.

519
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Spoon some of the toffee sauce

520
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's always gutting when you turn them out
and there's no sauce.

521
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] Divide the batter up

523
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's looking runny.
Let's stay with it, Mag.

524
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't change anything now.

525
00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Jürgen] Going in.
I'll check in 20 minutes.

526
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll go for 15 minutes to start with,
and see how it goes.

527
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Chigs] Don't know how long for.

528
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going for 15 minutes initially
and see what happens.

529
00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] Now you got a handshake,

530
00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was wondering if you would
get a tattoo to commemorate…

531
00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] What would it look like?

532
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A sort of greasy, chubby-fingered hand
on a part of your body.

533
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whereabouts?

534
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, I daren't say…
-[laughs]

535
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have half an hour left.
What you doing with that?

536
00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just get upset
when one of the bakers leaves,

537
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so this week I'm gonna go instead.

538
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good idea.

539
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm making the crème anglaise.
It's just thin custard.

540
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never made
a real custard with eggs before.

541
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not a good start. [chuckles]

542
00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Chigs] I'm warming the milk,
cream and vanilla.

543
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then I'll start adding
a little milk at a time.

544
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can always do with a workout.

545
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very fine balance
where it goes from custard to fried egg.

546
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Maggie] This is probably
the only thing that's right.

547
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if I burn this,
then I'm really stuffed.

548
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] That's nice.

549
00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no! There's lumps in it.

550
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hot!

551
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Feel like it definitely is scrambled.

552
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have 15 minutes.

553
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[gasps]
-I was gonna say that.

554
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The crème anglaise is done.

555
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All I have to wait
is for the puddings to cook.

556
00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Jürgen] They haven't collapsed.
-Nope.

557
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Skewer's wet,
but that wet could be the caramel sauce.

558
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just don't want them to be raw.

559
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Amanda] They're rising.

560
00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll do them for two more minutes,
'cause they're soggy.

561
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You all right?
-[Maggie] I just looked in the oven.

562
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got little splodgy messes
in the bottom of the pudding basins.

563
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just sunken to a gluey mess.

564
00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I must have left something out.
But it's all ticked off.

565
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Giuseppe] The other page is?
-[Maggie] No flour.

566
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, there is flour. There you go. Yeah.

567
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, right. That's what I didn't do.
I knew there was something.

568
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[timer beeps]

570

-Shaky.
-There's sticky toffee pudding. [chuckles]

571
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I should turn them out
while they're still warm.

572
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you doing a magic trick?

573
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will need three of those
and a little ball with that one.

574

575
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

576
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on.

577
00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll take that. Boom. [giggles]

578
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jürgen] I think it looks puddingy.

579
00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Amanda] Ah!
Oh, disaster. They're all raw.

580
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

581
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go for it.

582
00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've gotta laugh, I'll say.

583
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Should've done it while it was hot.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

if I squash them in?

592
00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1130
00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You certainly get the peanut flavour
and the peanut crunch.

1131
00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] That peanut layer is ridiculous.
Can't get through it.

1132
00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've just gone overkill
with the peanuts.

1133
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I quite like peanuts.
-[all laughing]

1134
00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It looks amazing.
The joconde's well done.

1135
00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I mean, this was taken from a <i>tile.</i>
-[Chigs chuckles] Yeah.

1136
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's so original
and it looks startling.

1137
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Paul] And two tiers.

1138
00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks like a delicious bathroom.

1139
00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

1140
00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bavarois are perfection.
They are perfection.

1141
00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your flavours
and your textures are superb.

1142
00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're just firm enough to stay up.

1143
00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, it's really clever.

1144
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't even like Black Forest gateau
and I love that.

1145
00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1146
00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] You've lost some of the imprime.

1147
00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit messy,
but let's have a look inside, shall we?

1148
00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Freya] The joconde is chocolate hazelnut.

1149
00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then there's a hazelnut dacquoise

1150
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then a layer
of Italian meringue buttercream,

1151
00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then a chocolate orange mousse

1152
00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:02.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then on top, it's orange jelly.

1153
00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's set quite hard.
It's more like a ganache.

1154
00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, yeah.
-[Paul] The mousse.

1155
00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think the orange is too strong.
-[Paul] So strong.

1156
00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But I actually think
your joconde is really good.

1157
00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1158
00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needed a cream, it needed something
in there to hold everything together.

1159
00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've had some beautiful vegan cakes.

1160
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not one of the better ones.

1161
00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See the Dam Busters have been in.

1162
00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

1163
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look at it.

1164
00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Well, it's a very pretty colour.

1165
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

1166
00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maggie, the flavour is lovely.
It's the essence of summer.

1167
00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The strawberries are just beautiful.

1168
00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Where's your second
element in this?

1169
00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The bavarois and the coulis.

1170
00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Ah, that's the second element.

1171
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What have you been doing
for four and a half hours?

1172
00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Doing it twice.
-[Paul] Ah, did you do it twice?

1173
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Flavours are lovely.
-[Prue] And the joconde is good.

1174
00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you so much.
-[Paul] Thank you.

1175
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've been more than kind.

1176
00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Maggie chuckling] It was what it was.

1177
00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They did say it tasted lovely,
but I think they were just being kind.

1178
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really happy with what I delivered.

1179
00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Think I might be up for consideration
for Star Baker.

1180
00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Giuseppe's and Jürgen's,
theirs is just another level.

1181
00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Freya] I feel like
that was pretty brutal,

1182
00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to be honest with you.

1183
00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not that I don't agree.

1184
00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But, like, I kinda just don't agree.

1185
00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

1186
00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, that Showstopper
ran the gamut, didn't it?

1187
00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Giuseppe, Jürgen, Chigs.

1188
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think they've all done
quite well out of this.

1189
00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Jürgen's was an amazing concept.
-I think Jürgen's was beautiful.

1190
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if you have another look
at Chigs', it's still holding well.

1191
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:49.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the layers were there.
The taste was delicious.

1192
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Fantastic flavour.
-[Paul] Some of them did collapse.

1193
00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There was a couple of people that messed
up a bit with textures and flavours.

1194
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You look at Maggie, she classed the puree
on top as a second element.

1195
00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not the case.

1196
00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're not buying it.
-[Paul] I'm not buying it.

1197
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:05.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It split as well.
I mean, it poured out all over the place.

1198
00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But also
I was really disappointed in Freya.

1199
00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because although she did better
with the dacquoise in this,

1200
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it was far too thick.

1201
00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That was very dry.

1202
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But then you look at Amanda's,

1203
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the Calvados in that bavarois
was the only thing you could taste.

1204
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And it split.
-But it tasted nice.

1205
00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You gotta look back
on the two challenges as well.

1206
00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We'll have another cup of tea
and another slice of cake,

1207
00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and then we'll make a decision.
-Slice of cake.

1208
00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[mimics Worzel Gummidge] Cup of tea
and a slice of cake, Aunt Sally.

1209
00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, bakers,
thank you for another great week.

1210
00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It falls to me to announce
who the Star Baker is.

1211
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that person is…

1212
00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chigs.

1213
00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matt] Congratulations!
-[cheering]

1214
00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:05.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, bakers, that means
that I've got the horrible job this week

1215
00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of announcing the person who's leaving us,

1216
00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and we're really gonna miss them.

1217
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The person who's leaving us this week is…

1218
00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maggie.

1219
00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's been such good fun.
[chuckling] It's been such…

1220
00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Maggie, honestly,
you've done so well.

1221
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Maggie] The whole thing
has been such fun, really.

1222
00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And just to have been part of it
is just a complete joy.

1223
00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] We're going to miss you so much.

1224
00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To have stayed for four weeks.
I think it comes pretty high, really.

1225
00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:47.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On a personal level,
nothing can beat delivering a baby.

1226
00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And bringing a new life into the world.

1227
00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it comes quite second.

1228
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just having a bad week.

1229
00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You'll have a good week next week.
-Thank you, I will.

1230
00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, God. Nightmare. [laughs]

1231
