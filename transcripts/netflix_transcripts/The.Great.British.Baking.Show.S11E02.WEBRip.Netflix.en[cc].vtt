like the teacake or the Wagon Wheel,

27
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

29
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

that these biscuits

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

than they used to be when we were kids.

31
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

32
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

35
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, the shape, the flavours,

36
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

37
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Marshmallow biscuits isn't something
I've had for a long time.

41
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
There's only one marshmallow biscuit
as far as I'm concerned,

42
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
and it's a Tunnock's Teacake.

43
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Oh, my days.

[Paul] Marshmallow biscuits.
Now this goes back to our childhood.

45
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me, it was the Wagon Wheel,
best thing ever.

46
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Marshmallow is mild in flavour and sweet.
So you need something that lifts it.

47
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like citrusy jam or something
with a bit of acidity will help.

49
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
although it should be relatively simple
to create the biscuits

50
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

417
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The balance between
the marshmallow and the biscuit is good.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very spicy.

420
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The topping, I like,
but it's overwhelmed by the biscuit.

421
00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's so potent that a delicate thing
like a marshmallow

422
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

423
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I don't really agree

424
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Paul] Let's have a look.

428
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Oh, my goodness,
that's neat as a pin.

429
00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, the Parma Violets,
I'm not getting too much of that,

430
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-which for me is a good thing.
-Okay.

431
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You do get
that lemon coming through.

432
00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you end up with a…
a pretty decent marshmallow biscuit.

433
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know, I think it's amazing.

434
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've got
so many flavours in there,

435
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you get them one after another.
It's perfect.

436
00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, thank you.
-Well done.

437
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was so nervous.

438
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] Well done.
-Thanks.

439
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-[Prue] Very pretty.
-[Paul] Yeah.

440
00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Saku] I baked, er, pistachio
and vanilla marshmallow biscuit.

441
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think your flavours are good.

442
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The jam comes through, the biscuit,
you do get that, er, pistachio flavour.

443
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My only comment would be
the biscuit needed

444
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-a little bit longer in the oven.
-Oh.

445
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] You could've spun
the chocolate neater than that,

446
00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I do like them.
I think they do look pretty nice. Ooh.

447
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] Wow.
-[Paul] Hello.

448
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your chocolate's a bit thick
at the bottom.

449
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That should've been paper-thin.

450
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Your orange jam is delicious.
-[Paul] Yeah.

451
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] If instead of putting
a blob of jam in the middle,

452
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-you'd put a layer of jam…
-Yeah.

453
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
…then every mouthful
would've been perfect.

454
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Well, they all look neat as a pin
and they're certainly identical.

455
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Let's cut one open.

456
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Good crack on the chocolate.
-Looks lovely inside, Josh.

457
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Nice and thin.
Chocolate's beautifully done.

458
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the balance
between the sweet and the tartness.

459
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Which comes from the jam.
-Yeah.

460
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got the nice fruits coming through
in there. Pretty, pretty spot on.

461
00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Well, your roses worked.

462
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Prue] Perfectly.

463
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The rose flavour's definitely there,
but I don't think it's too much.

464
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you're right.
The rose level is about right.

465
00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The berry in there needed to be
a little bit stronger and more of it,

466
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's very neat
and you've done a decent job.

467
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] They are a bit messy,

468
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
but I do think
they're exciting and attractive.

469
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] They look like crowns.
-[Abbi chuckles]

470
00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a lot of orange in there.

471
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, probably a little bit too much.

472
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The biscuit is lovely and crispy,
but the orange is really punching,

473
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and be careful to allow yourself time
to finish off your bakes.

474
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A little bit more finesse.
-Yeah.

475
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] At first glance, they look good.

476
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you look a bit closer,
they're a bit messy.

477
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Interesting inside,
a lot going on in there

478
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when it comes to the layers.

479
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] These are a peanut biscuit
with white chocolate,

480
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and peanut butter ganache,
and a banana marshmallow.

481
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know what I think about that,
because technically it's perfect.

482
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Hmm.

483
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe I don't share
your four-year-old's tastes.

484
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, possibly so.

485
00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Texture-wise, it's spot on.

486
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not a thick layer of chocolate.
-[Alison] Yeah.

487
00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's paper-thin, as it should be.

488
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you hadn't put the cartwheel on,
they'd look better.

489
00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I know.

490
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Bit messy, aren't they?
-[laughs]

491
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I knew they weren't gonna be
the most attractive offering in the tent.

492
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I… I wasn't planning on them
being quite so messy.

493
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison] They're gonna taste amazing.

494
00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] You're looking worried.
-[Prue and Keith laugh]

495
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Keith the truth is,
it really is delicious.

496
00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The, erm, marshmallow's holding its shape.

497
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The raspberry jam is terrific.
This is the nicest, crispest biscuit.

498
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it ugly but nice?

499
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

500
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Beauty's on the inside. But look at it.
-[Alison laughs]

501
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles] I'll take that.
-[Paul] Thank you.

502
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Nicky] So these are biscuit
with ground pistachios,

503
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
rhubarb and ginger jam,
and then chocolate on the top.

504
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Where's the ginger?
-[Nicky] The jam.

505
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It was there.
-Where is it?

506
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it ran a wee bit.

507
00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ran out the tent. There's nothing here.
-[laughter]

508
00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] He's trying to find some.

509
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, stop it. [laughs]

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] He's trying to see… Oh, no.
-[Paul] No.

511
00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison and Nicky laughing]

512
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] There's gotta be some somewhere.

513
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-There is. I just put a wee thin layer on.
-[Paul] Why?

514
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because I didn't want it to overpower it.

515
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you got a wee bit there.
Oh, dearie me, never mind.

516
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is dearie me,
because otherwise it's nicely constructed.

517
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The biscuit is beautiful,
the chocolate's nice and thin.

518
00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've done a good job,
but we needed the jam.

519
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

520
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Well, they look very sophisticated

521
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and beautifully piped, and the spinning
is just so thin and lovely.

522
00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My instinct is
that the biscuits are too thick.

523
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because I think that's quite a mouthful.

524
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think they're…

525
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The biscuit,
you think it's thick, but it's not,

526
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause it crumbles, it's delicate.

527
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the chocolate comes through,
not dark chocolate.

528
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it has a beautiful
malted aftertaste in the mouth.

529
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're delicate, pretty.

530
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And I have to shake your hand.
-[gasps]

531
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, good for you.
-[Alison squeals]

532
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:14.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tasha laughs]

533
00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

534
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I tell you what, that pleases me

535
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-as much as it pleases you.
-Beautiful.

536
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, that's a handshake.
I'll have two of those. Thanks. [laughs]

537
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[imperceptible]

538
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing] I got a Hollywood handshake.

539
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was not expecting that at all.

540
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes! I'm so proud.

541
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Keith] I don't think I could have
got any better than that.

542
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because the judges aren't blind,

543
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they could see that

544
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it looked like a flipping mess.

545
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Nicky] You can't be worried
about these things, 'cause it's done.

546
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I can't do anything about it.

547
00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And so, yeah,
you just got to enjoy the moment.

548
00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Keep smiling, 'cause that's what
life's all about, isn't it?

549
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[bee buzzing]

[Alison] <i>While the bakers could practise</i>

551
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

552
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello. Welcome back to the tent.

553
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's time for your technical challenge,

554
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which today has been set for you
by the lovely Prue.

555
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Any words of wisdom?

556
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I have only got one piece
of advice for you guys,

557
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that is use your time wisely.

558
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, as always, this challenge
is gonna be judged blind.

559
00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So, guys, off you go.
-[Noel] Off you pop.

560
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And when we say go, we mean go.

561
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't skulk back

562
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

563
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Prue would like you to make a batch

564
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of 12 perfectly baked custard creams.

565
00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Your custard creams should be made
with a short, buttery biscuit

566
00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and imprinted with that
classic custard cream design.

567
00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And they should be filled
with a custard buttercream.

568
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sounds delicious.

569
00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've got one and a half hours for this.
-That does not sound long enough.

570
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks…
-[Alison] Get set…

571
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake!

572
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abbi] Oh, my gosh.

573
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Cristy] I've never made
custard creams. I've eaten them,

574
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but never made one.

575
00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's good because you know
what they look and taste like.

576
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's bad because you know
what they look and taste like.

577
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[wearily] Custard creams.

578
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have no idea. [laughs]

579
00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm a fan.
I'm looking forward to this.

580
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huge custard man, yeah.

581
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm from the North.
I have it for breakfast. [chuckles]

582
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Custard creams, Prue.
This is a great technical challenge.

583
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But do you think it's too simple?

584
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not that simple.

585
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's actually easy to go wrong.

586
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the most common problem will be

587
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
people not chilling
their biscuit dough enough.

588
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs to go
into the oven really, really cold.

589
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's a slightest bit warm,
the butter will start to melt

590
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you will lose the definition
and the shape.

591
00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The next most common problem

592
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
will be not getting
the crème au beurre properly chilled.

593
00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all about chilling and timing.

594
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Choose your biscuit, Prue. Mmm.

595
00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It holds together beautifully.

596
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Beautiful custard flavour.
-[Prue] Mmm.

597
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a lovely snap to it as well
in the mouth.

598
00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tell you what, these taste a whole heap
better than the ones in the packet.

599
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
First instruction,
"Make biscuit dough, chill in freezer."

600
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just says, "Make the biscuit dough."
Which is really helpful. Thanks, Prue.

601
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[whispering] I looked up
a custard cream recipe last night. Shh.

602
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You cream together your butter and sugar
and then add in your egg,

603
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
add in your flour, and put
the custard powder in with the flour.

604
00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] Hey, Dana.
-Alison.

605
00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You look like you're ahead.

606
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't say that.
-You're doing good.

607
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's how it was last week
and I came last.

608
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't put no pressure on yourself.
-Yeah.

609
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you done this before?
-No. It's just biscuit, isn't it?

610
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just biscuit?
-[laughs] It's just biscuit.

611
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not just biscuit,
it's a custard cream.

612
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Keith] Get it straight in the freezer.

613
00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I get the impression
from how Prue was describing it

614
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that you haven't got
a great deal of time to mess around.

615
00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] Whole thing about this
is freezing,

616
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause you've gotta stamp,

617
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you wanna be able to
stamp it and see it.

618
00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you don't, what's the point?
It's not a custard cream.

619
00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's kind of amazing.
-I know.

620
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did you know that existed until today?
-No.

621
00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Me neither.
-It's almost like a game,

622
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
where we've got to be
the quickest to the button.

623
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-To the buzzer?
-Yeah.

624
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel laughs]

625
00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Who's the best at baking? Paul or Prue?
-[laughing]

626
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul. [chuckles]

627
00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who's gonna win the <i>Bake Off</i> this year?

628
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Keith.
-[both laugh]

629
00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So step number two is,
"For the custard buttercream,

630
00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
make a sugar syrup in a small pan
and boil to 121 Celsius."

631
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's getting very technical.

632
00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dissolve.

633
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's made like a French meringue
buttercream and I have made one already.

634
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know what I'm doing.

635
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So this is gonna heat up, and then
I'm going to pour it into my egg yolks,

636
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and whisk it until they're big and fluffy.

637
00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, we've just zoomed past 121.

638
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckling] So I'll just
leave it there for a sec. It's fine.

639
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] I've just got this to 121 degrees.

640
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I shall be plonking it in
with the egg yolks.

641
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know you've got to
do this really slowly.

642
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you chuck it all in, it will split.

643
00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The eggs haven't whisked up,
the buttercream has all gone to pot,

644
00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I need to start again.

645
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dana] So it's getting nice and thick.

646
00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Sieve custard powder, then whisk again."

647
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Get as much of that as possible
and give it another whisk.

648
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Keith] The buttercream's looking better.
I'm still a lot behind though.

649
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] "When ready,
whisk the butter into the buttercream."

650
00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once you incorporate the butter into it,
it will increase in volume, thicken up.

651
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll keep on whisking it,
it'll get nice and fluffy.

652
00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's too loose,
it will splodge out the side.

653
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[mimics squishing] It's never good.

654
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is pretty terrible.

655
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can see flecks of yellow,
but I can't get it to whisk any more.

656
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am not sure about the consistency.

657
00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I will go with this.

658
00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. Roll out the biscuit dough
and chill in the freezer.

659
00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a lot of chilling.

660
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We need to make 12. That is 24 biscuits.

661
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it needs to be thin.

662
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Custard creams.

663
00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About three mil thick I reckon.

664
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're rolling, it's looking all right.
Yeah, the dough's nice.

665
00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cristy. Have you used my biscuit dough?

666
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Cristy gasps]

667
00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You have?
-Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

668
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

669

[Cristy] Rowan. Ah.

670
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There you go. I'm so sorry, Rowan.

671
00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it's fine.

672
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you swapping dough, you kids?
-[laughs]

673
00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What happened?
-I found my dough missing.

674
00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Sabotage?
-[Rowan] No.

675
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've done a great job.

676
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you feel like you
rolled his out better than yours?

677
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-For sure.
-Oh, no, what's going on here?

678
00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Cristy] Don't.
-Feel like this is a bit sticky.

679
00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Need a bit more of this. [laughs] Sorry.

680

[Alison] <i>Before their dough is ready</i>

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think that'll do.

682
00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The longer it chills,
the better definition it'll be,

683
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to bake and then cool down.

[Saku] It's not working.

686
00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sticking. More time in the fridge.

687
00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got 45 minutes left, everyone.

688
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm hoping these are set
and they'll push out of this mould,

692
00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but we're gonna find out in a moment.

693
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

694
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't know how hard to push.
Am I gonna go all the way through?

695
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look, it's getting stuck.

696
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is this happening for other people?
I'm probably doing it wrong.

697
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give it a bit of welly.

698
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Nicky] Come on, out you come.

700
00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is a pretty little pattern.

701
00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite sweet, I think.

702
00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not a uniform custard cream,
but she's the first.

703
00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like the first pancake.

704
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's always the worst one,

705
00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

706
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] They're not looking too bad
at the moment.

708
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can do.

709
00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, presto.

710
00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll say that was the best one.

711
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Some of us have got the touch.
-You do.

712
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It won't stop sticking, so it's going back
in the freezer with a layer of flour.

713
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nightmare, aren't they? After you.

714
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Saku] It's sticking
to the… [groans] cutter.

716
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

717
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm very concerned about this.

This dough has gone too soft
to manipulate.

[Saku] Freezer.

720
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you've got half an hour left.

721
00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah. [whimpers]

722
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Running out of time.

723
00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's not very long.
I need to get mine in the oven.

724
00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Cristy] It just says, "Bake."

725
00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thirteen to start with.

726
00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[beeps]
-Eight minutes.

727
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm gonna go for about…
[softly] 12 minutes.

728
00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] They're pale.

729
00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Quite insipid, actually.
Like me in the winter.

730
00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Come on, custard cream.
-[Matty] Abbi, get a bit closer.

731
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

732
00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's already melting.
Think the design's just gonna be lost.

733
00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't chill them long enough.

734
00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Keith] So I've put a batch of 12 in.

735
00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gonna be touch-and-go again.

736
00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had timing issues this morning.

737
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you've got ten minutes left.

738
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ten minutes.
-I don't know when they'll be ready?

739
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] Oh, I don't know.
It's hard to call, isn't it?

740
00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Once they get brown, they're coming out.

741
00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love a custard cream and I'm gonna be
mentally scarred by them now, forever.

742
00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll never be able to eat one again.

743
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm coming out.
-[Cristy] Mine look a bit ropey,

744
00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but they're coming out, whatever.

745
00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're looking all right.
Actually, yeah. Looking custard cream-ish.

746
00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abbi] That one's nice.

747
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This one's gonna be a top,
this one, bottom.

748
00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a man with a plan.

749
00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Keith] I'm gonna take these out,
they gotta cool down.

750
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will put it in the freezer. Ah… [gasps]

751
00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I dropped.

752
00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Rowan, what are you doing?
-[Rowan] I'm warming my cream.

753
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing] Rowan.

754
00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think
my buttercream's as nice as I'd like.

755
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've probably overfilled them,
but it doesn't matter.

756
00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:12.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rowan] I'm shaking. This is ridiculous.

757
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't do it.

758
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you've got one minute left.

759
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I can't get 12 out,
at least I'll get six out.

760
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Cristy] I don't know what they'll say.
They don't look perfect.

761
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Saku] So ugly.

762
00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:29.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, bakers, your time is up.

763
00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

764
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please come and bring your bakes and
place them behind your beautiful photos.

765
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Saku] They are so ugly.

766
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look absolutely… [softly] rubbish.

767
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got custard on my trainers.

-On your Meghan's? Yeah.
-On my Meghan's? What's that?

769
00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Your Meghan Trainers.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, bakers,
let's welcome back our judges.

772
00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We missed you, guys.

[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue are looking</i>

774
00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>with their iconic pattern</i>

775
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>with a smooth custard buttercream,</i>

776
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not very easy. But you
seem to have more or less managed it.

777
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
More or less.

778
00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shall we start over here, Prue?

779
00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] They look a bit pale.

780
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They do look pale.

781
00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is a bit of definition there.

782
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It's good.
-[Paul] They are pretty neat.

783
00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And they're not overfilled. Nice snap.

784
00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That biscuit just needs
a bit longer in the oven.

785
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got a slightly floury taste.

786
00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Moving on to number two. Now these
lost a little bit of definition here.

787
00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The filling inside is a bit sparse.

788
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Also it's not quite set.

789
00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Mmm.

790
00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still very soft.

791
00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And so is the biscuit.

792
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not much snap to that.

793
00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It needs a little longer in the oven.

794
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah, it does.

795
00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] This one, unfortunately,
has very little definition.

796
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You can't read custard cream on it.
-[Paul] Yeah.

797
00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Well filled.

798
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Difference in thickness and thin.

799
00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just not rolled enough
because the dough was quite soft.

800
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The custard is better than the biscuit.
-[Paul] Yeah, it is.

801
00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This has got colour to it
which I quite like.

802
00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We expect a little bit more definition,
but it's not bad.

803
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] The piping's pretty good. Mmm.
-[Paul] Yeah.

804
00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And tastes properly baked.
-[Paul] Hmm.

805
00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Moving on, lovely colour.
Pretty even on the top and bottom.

806
00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very good.

807
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well filled.
-[Paul] Mmm.

808
00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Needed a little bit longer in the oven.

809
00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a pity because, apart from that,
I would have said that's pretty faultless.

810
00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look wonderful.

811
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Now this one's got
more colour on it.

812
00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's definition here.

813
00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although it's washed out
on a few of them. Well filled.

814
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The custard comes through nicely.

815
00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good flavour, same old problem.

816
00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A little bit underbaked.

817
00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[thunder rumbling]

818
00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Lost a bit of definition in places.

819
00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, and a little unevenly filled.
-[Paul] Yeah.

820
00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is actually
a bit of a crunch to that.

821
00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. It's not bad, but it's a bit thick.

822
00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This one, a lot of them are misshapen.

823
00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That one's thin at one end
and fat at the other.

824
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That one has got no definition at all.

825
00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That custard actually curdled.

826
00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's a shame.

827
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue] Beautiful.

828
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nice and equal. Colour's right.
It's got the slight brown hue to it.

829
00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That looks really good.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nice and thin.
-[Paul] Yeah. Mmm.

831
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now you're talking. Really crispy.
That's a custard cream.

832
00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In fact, that's a lot better
than a commercial custard cream.

833
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very, very good.

834
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] These are a bit messy.
Uneven, no definition,

835
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the dough was obviously very soft,
difficult to cut.

836
00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's like rubber.
-Not a success, sadly.

837
00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

838
00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue] Don't they?

839
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even. They look very professional.

840
00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sadly, slightly underbaked.

841
00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know why?

842
00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-'Cause they're too thick.
-[Paul] Mmm.

843
00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Another couple of minutes,
that would have been perfect.

844
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a real shame.

845
00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] <i>Paul and Prue will now rank</i>

a bit misshapen.

848
00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

850
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

851
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

852
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

They're just a little bit soft.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

863
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

866
00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Morning, bakers.
For your showstopper challenge,

900
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue and Paul would like you to make
an amazing illusion biscuit display,

901
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is depicting your favourite meal.

902
00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What if their favourite meal
<i>is</i> a plate of biscuits?

903
00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Didn't think about that, did you, Paul?

904
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now you can choose any style of biscuit,
it's completely up to you,

905
00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's gotta taste amazing
and look visually realistic.

906
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have four hours,
which seems a hell of a lot of time.

907
00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks…
-Get set…

908
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake!

909
00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looking forward to the challenge.
Bit different.

910
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like something you'd never
think of doing basically.

911
00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, so, yeah, it's pretty cool.

912
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like I'm a very creative person,
so I love coming up with new ideas.

913
00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's kind of like my way,
I can finally get inventive.

914
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm very excited. I really am.

915
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've asked them to make
a meal or banquet scene out of biscuits.

916
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It could be burgers, pizzas,
could be anything.

917
00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mine personally, pizza.

918
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They really have to be
a little artistic with this.

919
00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Certainly a little bit of
sculpting knowledge would be useful.

920
00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nearly all the biscuits they bake

921
00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
are going to have to be
a very specific shape.

922
00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So there's a real danger
of overworking the dough.

923
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we all know
that if you overwork the dough,

924
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it gets tough and loses

-That biscotti is delicious.
-Mmm. Oh!

1230
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I love the crunch,

1231
00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the flavour, the texture's spot on.

1232
00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really good.
Both of those biscuits are perfect.

1233
00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have set a bar
that's a little bit high.

1234
00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-Well done.

1235
00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:35.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1236
00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] I think that it looks wonderful.

1237
00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:42.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Let's have a look at this,
that's the ginger.

1238
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ginger's got a good flavour,
nice and warm.

1239
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this a biscotti?

1240
00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, almond and dried cherry.

1241
00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Biscotti's very nice, and tangy.

1242
00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've done well.
It's smart, it's neat. Well done.

1243
00:56:58.680 --> 00:56:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, guys.

1244
00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] We'll start,
we'll have a look at these…

1245
00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rowan] It's a spiced black pepper
gingerbread-type thing.

1246
00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Good flavour.

1247
00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Texture's softened slightly.
Erm, because of the topping on it.

1248
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The illusion bit doesn't work
all that well.

1249
00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After a while you realise
that's maybe salami on top.

1250
00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that right? Yeah.
-Yeah. But I do like the flavours.

1251
00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Flavours are good.
-[Prue] Yeah.

1252
00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a terrific illusion.
I mean, as soon as you look at it,

1253
00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it really looks like a cheeseboard.

1254
00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These crackers, this one I wanna try.
I saw you making these.

1255
00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, they looked as if
they were stuffed with cranberries.

1256
00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:42.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very crumbly shortbread. It's lovely.

1257
00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Well done, Matty.

1258
00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Thank you, cheers.

1259
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I think it's clever.
I'm not quite sure I've seen many tomatoes

1260
00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-like that.
-[Prue] No.

1261
00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're from the south coast. We…

1262
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[all laughing]
-We have very good…

1263
00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have very good growing conditions
and you get that redness.

1264
00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:05.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's amazing. I like the way
you've done the bread. Oh, dear.

1265
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very soft.

1266
00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Great flavour.

1267
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your flavours are always good.

1268
00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The issue is I shouldn't be able
to push my finger in.

1269
00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] yeah.
-It's soft.

1270
00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The ham slice in the middle,
is that the same?

1271
00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-That is much better baked.

1272
00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, the ice creams.

1273
00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:26.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's vanilla-flavoured Viennese
and raspberry buttercream.

1274
00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Slightly raw inside, the biscuit.
You struggled on this one a bit, Keith.

1275
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I have to say,
I've never seen a pizza that deep.

1276
00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dana] Neither have I.

1277
00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughter]

1278
00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But that's the dream. [chuckles]

1279
00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, the bottom two are the shortbread
and the top is just a vanilla biscuit

1280
00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with the date filling.

1281
00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I enjoyed all that a lot.

1282
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've done a good job.
The flavours and textures are clever.

1283
00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's so original.
I mean, I love the date-stuffed crust.

1284
00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Dana.
-Thank you.

1285
00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I like the look of this, it's clever.

1286
00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very nice. Steamer basket is beautiful.
Absolutely perfect. And what's in these?

1287
00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Abbi] Er, so it's an apricot,
pistachio and thyme filling.

1288
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Filling is very strong. But delicious.
And the biscuit is crisp and flavoursome,

1289
00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it looks like a dim sum.
This looks lovely.

1290
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've done a decent job with this.
The illusion works.

1291
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thanks.
-[Prue] Well done.

1292
00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] These are rotis.

1293
00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very delicious.
-That is fantastic. [laughs]

1294
00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're so good.
That in its own right

1295
00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
should be
a well-known Sri Lankan delicacy.

1296
00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Okay.
-[Prue] Let's try a hopper.

1297
00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The spices are good,
but you could've done more.

1298
00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps if you'd have made
the egg a little bigger

1299
00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and done it with spring onion,

1300
00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a bit of chilli
so that it looked more colourful.

1301
00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

1302
00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] It's just beautiful.

1303
01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Amazing.

1304
01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are these chips shortbread?

1305
01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] Er, just vanilla,
like a sablé biscuit.

1306
01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They taste nice, but they're a bit burnt.

1307
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:13.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's have a look at this pie.
-[Prue] What is the biscuit here?

1308
01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like a pistachio shortbread
in there as well.

1309
01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's absolutely delicious.
-It is.

1310
01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's a triumph. I really do.

1311
01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've done
a great job on the biscuits.

1312
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Except for the overbaking slightly.

1313
01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the filling is wonderful. Well done.

1314
01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Excellent. Well done.
-Thank you.

1315
01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] It's a good-looking thing. It's…

1316
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It's neat.
-[Paul] It's well detailed, neat.

1317
01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Try the shortbread.

1318
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your chips look more
like shortbread fingers than chips.

1319
01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughing] They do.
-[Paul] They do, don't they?

1320
01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] What is the beef?

1321
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Nicky] The beef is a chocolate biscuit
with a chocolate ganache

1322
01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with orange and hazelnuts through it.

1323
01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chocolate and hazelnut are beautiful.
The texture falls apart in the mouth,

1324
01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the ganache just tops it off.

1325
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's a good sandwich biscuit.
-[Prue] Hmm. And what's the bowl made of?

1326
01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Gingerbread.
-[judges] Gingerbread.

1327
01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The flavour is very gingery.
Too thick and underbaked.

1328
01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Needed longer in the oven.
And thinner and it would've been better.

1329
01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:16.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Nicky] Yeah.

1330
01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Josh, it is so neat.

1331
01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And so clearly what it is.

1332
01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's a little triumph.

1333
01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's a big triumph.
Shall we try?

1334
01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is the orange shortbread?
-[Josh] Yeah.

1335
01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's beautiful. Delicate.
-Beautiful. Light.

1336
01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Mmm.
-[Prue] Look at that.

1337
01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Look at that tomato.
-Look at that tomato.

1338
01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let me hold it up.
-[Paul] That's clever.

1339
01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can see through it.

1340
01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Isn't that amazing?
-[Paul] Let's try this chocolate one.

1341
01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's walnuts, pecans and almonds
and some currants and cherries as well.

1342
01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's chewy, it's crispy, it's zingy,
it's full of flavour.

1343
01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think overall you've created,
erm, something a little bit special.

1344
01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, you don't often get illusion stuff
that tastes and looks as good as that.

1345
01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's amazing, mate. Well done.
-Thank you.

1346
01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That was incredible.
Wasn't expecting that at all.

1347
01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] You know what.

1348
01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Come on.
-[Paul] I'll come to you.

1349
01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you. Oh, wow.
-That was amazing.

1350
01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Honestly, it was seriously good. Amazing.

1351
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Josh has pipped Star Baker,
but that's fine. Erm, another time.

1352
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs] I was… touching distance
and then it was gone.

1353
01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm actually quite good
at making a real steak pie.

1354
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckling] But maybe
not so much out of biscuit.

1355
01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I've got a right
to be a bit concerned, I think.

1356
01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] <i>It's decision time</i>
<i>for Paul and Prue.</i>

1357
01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Who will be crowned Star Baker</i>
<i>and who will be leaving the tent?</i>

1358
01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What a showstopper.
You've got your handshake out.

1359
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it was delayed.

1360
01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was, because I was so full of biscuit…

1361
01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughing]
-Everything was numb,

1362
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then it hit me and I went,
"Hang on, I owe him a handshake."

1363
01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] That was so good.
-[Prue] Josh is definitely in the running.

1364
01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I mean, he was sort of mid… midway,

1365
01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but he's just escalated himself

1366
01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
into the position of
challenging for Star Baker.

1367
01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm really thrilled about Tash
'cause I think she's up there too.

1368
01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] I agree.
-[Prue] She's hardly put a foot wrong.

1369
01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who do you think's in danger of going?

1370
01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Keith.
-Yeah, Keith.

1371
01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] The thing is,
with Keith, he's got flavour.

1372
01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's delivering good taste.

1373
01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nicky, er, has struggled a bit as well.

1374
01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you look at her bakes
and look at everybody else's, you think,

1375
01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Hang on. It's not as good
as we initially thought it was."

1376
01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm glad I'm not in your shoes, judges.

1377
01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'd quite like to have eaten 70 biscuits.
-[both laughing]

1378
01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, well done.
It's been an amazing week

1379
01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it was a fabulous showstopper.

1380
01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fortunately,
I've got the job of announcing

1381
01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which one of you
will be Star Baker this week.

1382
01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the person

1383
01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
who's Star Baker this week is…

1384
01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tasha.

1385
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all applauding]

1386
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, sadly, I have the job
of letting go of one baker,

1387
01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and we're just getting to know you all,
we're absolutely adoring you.

1388
01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the baker leaving today is…

1389
01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keith.

1390
01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sorry, Keith.
-It's all right.

1391
01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel fine. There's… there's nothing sad
about… about this moment.

1392
01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thank you very much,
it's been so lovely to meet you.

1393
01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've had the most fantastic time.

1394
01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I… I said to somebody, the first weekend,
there was bruises up and down my arms

1395
01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
where I was pinching myself
every half hour, so, erm,

1396
01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know how many hours
I'm gonna spend

1397
01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in the rest of my life
banging on about this.

1398
01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very happy to still be here, so, yes.

1399
01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Happy, but sad at the same time.

1400
01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because Keith's gone.

1401
01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

1402
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tash is such
a deserving Star Baker this week

1403
01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause her signature yesterday,
and I tasted it, it was incredible.

1404
01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it was well worth
Star Baker for the week on its own.

1405
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The handshake, I will remember that.

1406
01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Well done.
-Thank you.

1407
01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Very good.

1408
01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the weirdest feeling because you put
all this time and this energy,

1409
01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and at the end of the day,
it's biscuit

1410
01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or cake or it's something that you eat.

1411
01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But… [sighs]

1412
01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
…it means so much.

1413
01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And… yeah.

1414
01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it's… it's a really good feeling.
[laughs]
