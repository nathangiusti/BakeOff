This is the cross lamination

203
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'm cutting it
and then popping it on the top.

204
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Usually, if you've got a croissant,
you'll see all the layers from the side.

205
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

so you'll see all the lamination.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So basically,
I'm putting myself up for slaughter.

207
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's the semi-final
so I have to do something adventurous.

208
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The secret is
you want it tight so it stays tight

211
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it doesn't have the space to grow.

It's a Middle Eastern spice mix.
It's a really kind of rich flavour.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

that's all I'm saying.

229
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

230
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

231
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Christiaan] I wanna get as long

232
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause I think the proving
is my main issue.

233
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to see what the temperature is like.

234
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At 30 degrees, that butter just melts away
and you don't get your lamination.

235
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you want your pastries to prove
at about 26, max, I think.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'm not convinced that just piping
a load of stuff inside a croissant

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

trying to build up

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Your technical challenge has been set
by Patisserie Paul.

430
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

431
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to really be careful

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the exquisite French patisserie classic,

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your opera cakes should have
eight layers of joconde sponge,

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
coffee, crème aux beurre

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

two hours and 45 minutes.

445
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

446
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the opera cake originates
from the layers of the opera house.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it is a bit scary.

449
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, an opera cake. Really difficult.

450
00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have layers of joconde sponge,
crème aux beurre, then ganache.

451
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's two ways to introduce
the coffee flavour into this.

452
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

453
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the other is the syrup
drizzled over the top of the joconde.

454
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

and you've got your glaze on,

455
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then you need to think about trimming it.

456
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

how do you stop that smearing?

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

with a hot knife.

and the quantities.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Otherwise you just said, "Make joconde,

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-No, never made an opera cake.

Egg whites, sugar

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it must look like a tangerine

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:35.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the person definitely
going through to the final is…

1132

1137
00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, that means
I've got the devastating job

1138

1139
00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's heartbreaking 'cause I feel like
you should all go through to the final.

1140
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1146
00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can't let these boys keep having it.

1147
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[sighs] Patisserie got me.

1149
00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I can't be sad.

1150
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've had the absolute best time.

1151
00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's brilliant, I can't be sad.

1152
00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1153
00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Well done, Gill.

1154
00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]

1155
00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It wasn't that Gill messed up,

1156
00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's just that everybody else
was that little bit better.

1157
00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And she's such a lovely lady,

1158
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and she represented the North
and my part of the world extremely well.

1159
00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I was so sorry to see Gill go.

1160
00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She just goes for very homely flavours,
which I absolutely love.

1161
00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps not quite as ambitious
but just as good a baker.

1162
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Georgie] It broke my heart
to hear Gill's name being called.

1163
00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I also thought,
"Oh, my God, I'm a finalist."

1164
00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was so bittersweet.

1165
00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Congratulations.

1166
00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've done it, babes.
You're going into the final. [chuckles]

1167
00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1168
00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[in English] The Welsh are still in. Yay!

1169
00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hey, babe.

1170
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1171
00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Nick] <i>Oh!</i>

1172
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah! [laughs]

1173
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I genuinely did.

1174
00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dylan] Thanks for everything.

1175
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, you are a star,
and you know that, don't you?

1176
00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is your calling, and if you…

1177
00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dylan] The greatest privilege
of getting into the final,

1178
00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's about this whole thing
gives you the opportunity

1179
00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to actually invest time
into something that you love.

1180
00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not thinking about anything else,
just thinking about making good food.

1181
00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:58.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like this is all I've ever wanted.
It's absolutely insane.

1182
00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1183
00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's been absolutely marvellous
and you've made me feel so special.

1184

Every bake that I had
has been something special to me

1190
00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And, yeah, I've just baked what I know
and what I love for who I love.

1192
00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna go and rob that lilac bowl
'cause I've had my eye on it forever.

1193

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Gill] Week one I was at the back bench
and I said, "Ooh, look, a lavender bowl."

1195
00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Wouldn't it be lovely
to have a bowl like that?"

1196
00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I won't get my cake stand,
but I've got my bowl.
