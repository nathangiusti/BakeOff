is the sponge itself

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It should be like a very, very light,
bendable-without-cracking sponge.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

about 150 different layers and flavours.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

is from, you know, 100 to 95.

319
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sandro, we were asking for finesse.
Do you think you've pulled it off?

320
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

321
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Finesse I always associate
with something slightly smaller.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

323
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is a little clumsy,
but it makes your mouth water.

[Paul] We've got all the layers there.

[Prue] Let's see about the taste.

327
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all absolutely delicious.

328
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just so rich and strong.

329
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Quite overwhelming
with the nuts and everything else,

330
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
there's a lot going on here.

331
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the layers are soft,
but not stodgy, except the peanut one,

332
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-it's a bit gluey.
-That's the only one that had gelatine.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the sponge on the bottom,

334
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's really beautiful.

335
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's some of the best sponge
I've ever eaten,

336
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's just amazing.

337
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I'll take it with me.

338
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, thank you very much.

339
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Took me all my willpower, not to just go…

340
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

342
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] It looks a bit untidy on the side.

343
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This one, the way it's been tied up,
it's broken slightly.

344
00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But overall, I think
they're very sweet and pretty.

345
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz chuckles] A lot of flowers.

346
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] There is a lot of flowers there.

347
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The plum is nicely set,

348
00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the chocolate certainly isn't,
it's too loose.

349
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should be able
to cut through it and get a slice.

350
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flavours are lovely.
Plum and chocolate go well together.

351
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the joconde is quite tough.

352
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's much firmer than the middle.

353
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It comes down to the textures.
But the flavour's good.

354
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Well done.
-Thanks.

-I do love the outside of this.

358
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite elegant.

359
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

362
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The strawberry cream
is not quite holding its shape.

363
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

364
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Syabira, you've got excellent flavours.

365
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're unusual.

366
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would never have thought
of that combination, and it really works.

367
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the two creams that you've got
your fruit in, they're not set enough.

368
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the issue, 'cause your bottom layer
with the peanut butter is. Thank you.

369
00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's a little bit messy.

370
00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks like a tiramisu.

373
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

375
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the textures are lovely.
Very, very light.

376
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I like the fact
that the sponge is light too.

377
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Coffee levels are perfect.

378
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They blend beautifully
with well-set cream.

379
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Inside and flavour, ten out of ten.

380
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

382
00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not quite up
to the Patisserie Week standard.

383
00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They said it's slightly unusual,

391
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

392
00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your vertical tarts
should be made up of crisp rings

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They need to be identical and elegant,

419
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the sort of thing you'd see

422
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

423
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

424
00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have no idea
what it's supposed to look like.

425
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

426
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] This will be very challenging,

427
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because this is,

428
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope I could smash it, actually.

430
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What on earth are you thinking?

431
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the semifinal.
We should be pushing them.

432
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Take us through it.
-It's a really delicate pastry.

433
00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a shortcrust, but it has ground
almonds in it, so it's really tender.

434
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chocolate mousse
has whisked meringue in it

435
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to make it a bit mousse-y.

436
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then when it's set,
decorate it with jelly,

437
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
whipped cream, raspberries,

438
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and little tempered chocolate discs.

439
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And gold leaf.

440
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, I thought it was difficult.

441
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckling] So it's not exactly easy.

442
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay, should we try?

443
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry's got
such a nutty flavour, it's delicious.

444
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a really rich mousse, isn't it?

445
00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Mmm,
and the raspberry's sharp as well.

446
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The trick is the assembly.

447
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they don't do that carefully
and with precision,

448
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-that's where they'll fall down.
-Yeah, I can see trouble.

449
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can see trouble in the tent.

450
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

451
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm weighing all the ingredients.

452
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

453
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's ground almonds.

454
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] This is similar to
the French pâte sablée.

455
00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like shortcrust,
but with a bit of almond there.

456
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just adding in the beaten egg,
it says one to two tablespoons.

457
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just gonna mix it until it's combined.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Matt] It gets a bit windy.

460
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah. [chuckling]
-[Matt] What on earth is a vertical tart?

461
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We'll have to wait until it's done.
-To know what it is?

462
00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Got an image in your mind?

463
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nope.
-Wow, now that truly is blind-baking.

464
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] I've been first
for two technicals in a row.

465
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would really like to get a third.

466
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That would be good.

467
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I haven't got a handshake yet, so I'm--

468
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've never had a handshake?
-No.

469
00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you like one from me?

470
00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Meaningless.
-It means a lot to me.

471
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Kinda need this hand, though.
-Oh, yes, sorry.

472
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks. [laughing]

473
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

474
00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] So this one needs to be
in the fridge, so it's easy to handle.

475
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Done, and make the chocolate mousse.

476
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] This is
the meringue-type mousse.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Syabira] When you bake the tart,
it has to have something to hold

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

620
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've never used gold leaf before.
How do you apply it?

621
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. Don't touch it! [chuckles]

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] No! Why would you do this to us?

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Right, bakers.

629
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's quite impressive.
-Yeah, some of them are all right.

630
00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, start with this one.

631
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One's fallen down already.

632
00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They do look pretty neat.

633
00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're a bit dark,
I think, in places. Overbaked.

634
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a ganache. It's no longer a mousse.

635
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. Mmm. Tastes lovely.

636
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really hazelnutty.

637
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The flavour's good.
But the problem for me is it's too stiff.

638
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Okay.

639
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] This looks very neat.
Good colour. Uniform.

640
00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The chocolate's like a ganache.

641
00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite delicious though.

642
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we'd said, "Can you put
ganache inside pastry," it's spot on.

643
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue chuckling] Yes.
These ones are a bit messier.

644
00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Dear me. Yeah.
The actual pastry itself is very thick.

645
00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Jelly's not set.

646
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm, the pastry's good,
but it doesn't look good.

647
00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] No, it doesn't look good.
Now, these are slightly underbaked.

648
00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] This is not quite
the precision we're asking for.

649
00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But this mousse looks better.

650
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] That's more mousse-like.
-[Prue] Mmm.

651
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's underbaked.
You see how soft that is?

652
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Oh, yeah.

653
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's a shame 'cause the chocolate's
actually all right. Wow.

654
00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matt] <i>Prue and Paul will now rank</i>

655
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In fourth spot, we have this one.

656
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sandro, pastry far too thick.

657
00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And it was a mess.
-Yeah.

658
00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In third spot, we have this one.

659
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Janusz, the mousse was the best,

660
00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the pastry was
really underbaked and soft.

661
00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In second place, we have this one,
whose is this?

662
00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Abdul, slightly overbaked.

663
00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The chocolate was a little bit tough.

664
00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which means… Syabira.

665
00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pastry was beautifully neat.

666
00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It had the precision we were asking for.

667
00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

668
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

669
00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, technical,
either I'm first or last. [chuckling]

670
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:04.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, given my pastries were
falling apart, second is pretty awesome.

671
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] That was confusing.
Really confusing.

672
00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My comprehension,
I could work on that a little.

673
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] You know,
it's four of us, I was third.

674
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still sort of middle. [laughing]

675
00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But tomorrow will show,
one crack and you're out.

[Paul] We've got a situation where
one of the people who have been

680
00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
pretty consistent throughout is
in a bit of trouble, that's Janusz.

681
00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I expect him to bounce
back in the showstopper.

682
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But at the moment, I'd say he was
in the worst position out of the four.

683
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think he's not
the only one in trouble.

684
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Sandro, his flavours are great,

685
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but he never finishes
and it never looks perfect.

686
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He did a lot of work
in his signature, didn't he?

687
00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, that sometimes
has been his downfall.

688
00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] One I'd really root for is Abdul.
I mean, he hasn't had Star Baker.

689
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's gone under the radar, hasn't he?

690
00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But he's consistently good.

691
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Have to say it's Abdul
and Syabira in line for Star Baker,

692
00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's Janusz and Sandro
in line for going home.

693
00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's almond flavour, of course,
because it's made of almond flour,

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've got to get their bake right.
Overbake it, you'll lose that chewiness.

737
00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they underbake it,
it'll be too soft on the outside

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's gonna go in for
about 12 minutes, but I think…

832
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll bake these longer
'cause they are the base,

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Syabira] The key is
making the biscuits strong,

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it has to be soft
and gooey still in the middle.

840
00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

848
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

871
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would've liked the biscuits to have been
baked within the first two hours.

872
00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've got a lot to do and not much time.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] These are chromosomes.

874
00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Chromosome is like a bag

875
00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you untangle your genetic structure,
which is your helix,

876
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you will have about
67 billion miles of DNA.

877
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

878
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Krokan, I think this is a really
exquisite challenge for the semifinal.

879
00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's really difficult.

880
00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you think that Syabira
is trying to do the double helix…

881
00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Don't know how she'll manage that.

882
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] The structure itself
is ambitious.

883
00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would admit that, so if I muffed it,

884
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not through for the final.

885
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If Syabira's doesn't fall over,
she could win.

886
00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] This does play
to Syabira's strengths

887
00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and also actually Janusz's.

888
00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's building Pride.

889
00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The layers have to be
really carefully brought together.

890
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] All is good.
All is colourful and pretty.

891
00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once isomalt is in those hearts,
I can start assembling.

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That looks quite…
It looks amazing, quite spindly.

894
00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm almost done now.
There's the last pieces.

895
00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just think he's so precise,
organised, and it's a really good idea.

896
00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you got Sandro building
essentially Big Ben with all the bits.

897
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I would be surprised
if Sandro finishes though,

898
00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because it's so complicated.

899
00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure he'll finish it,
but to what level of finesse?

900
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They keep underestimating me.

901
00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm being ambitious with it.

902
00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going for it, for perfection.

903

[Matt] <i>Just 90 minutes remain.</i>

904
00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] Last one.

905
00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Should be enough for the entire helix.

906
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on sugar, cook.

907
00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm using caramel

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

909
00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

910
00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the most nerve-breaking part.

911
00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

912
00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] Oh, this one's not meeting.

913
00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah… [mumbles] Quickly.

914
00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's better.

915
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am gluing
this main structure together now.

916
00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is gonna be
the central pole of the helix.

917
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has to be super straight,

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I can arrange this together

919
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so that it wouldn't fall down.

920
00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No room for wonkiness.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have one hour left.

931
00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Stress.

932
00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, these are the chromosome.

933
00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] I'm making marzipan decoration,

934
00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
my stars and planets and astronauts,
and then start assembling it.

935
00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it's taking shape?

936
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's the purpose of this cup here?

937
00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] It'll hold
what I'm about to put on.

938
00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's all good. Mmm-hmm.
-[Matt] All good?

939
00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh!

940
00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandro] This cup's not great, innit?
-No.

941
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I nearly had a moment there.

942
00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] I'm doing the double helix.

943
00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gonna spiral to the top.

944
00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just trying to make sure
they're all vertical and straight.

945
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And make sure my caramel doesn't burn.

946
00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Make more glue. [exhales]

947
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My eyes are burning.

948
00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What a different life
it'd be if you were that tall.

949
00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like your purple gloves.

950
00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both laugh]

951
00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You look like a Batman villain.

952
00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[giggles] Thank you.

953
00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] I have the flat edges.

954
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And now it's just time to start
sticking them together.

955
00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Seems to be holding really well
at the moment.

956
00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

957
00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] This is the London Eye.

958
00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's custard and rhubarb.

959
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not gonna hold. It's too weighty.

960
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Oh, this is huge.

961
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is what it's about, right?

962
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got to do pipework now.

963
00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Pipework.
-Pipework, make the dreams work.

964
00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Everyone's dug in deep,
is pulling off some business.

965
00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] I mean,
Janusz's looks like perfection.

966
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Beautiful, huh?
-Can't see the caramel.

967
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at my mess, but I'll hide it.

968
00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Get in the zone, in the groove.

969
00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Got an amazing structure.
Now make it look pretty.

970
00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have half an hour left.

971
00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Syabira] Nearly there with assembly.

972
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then move on
with some of the decoration.

973
00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My royal icing is Brighton Gin flavoured.

974
00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Janusz, I need some help.

975
00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] I'm coming.

976
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What should I do?

977
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to put this on the top.

978
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not sure if it's stable.

979
00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-Gonna lift it, and you help.

980
00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna hold the--

981
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm holding the biscuit on the bottom.

982
00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, can you hold it?

983
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-Crazy Syabira, of course.

984
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just doing some pipework.

985
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just to add some decor
and definition to some of the bits.

986
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] So far so good.

987
00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just the final top bit left now,
then I'll go back to my marzipan,

988
00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
colour them, stick them.

989
00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Finish this, finish this.

990
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] My marzipan's falling off.

991
00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After I've finished my hearts,
I will get piping.

992
00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Every single heart needs
to have a white outline.

993
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] That's the isomalt
to bring some colour.

994
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm doing blue, white,
and red for the flags.

995
00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's coming together.

996
00:46:55.320 --> 00:47:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm trying to cover up the imperfections.
I need to show I can finish things off.

997
00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you only have five minutes left.

998
00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lots to do, lots to do.

999
00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These look an absolute mess though.

1000
00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] This is marzipan
with ground pistachios.

1001
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm stamping the letters of the DNA.

1002
00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The code in the genome
contain four different letters,

1003
00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
G, C, T, and A.

1004
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] You all right?
-Bit stressed.

1005
00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Got enough time?
-Mmm, doubt it.

1006
00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll do what I can. I'm not giving up.

1007
00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How long do we have?

1008
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have one minute left.

1009
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[breathes deeply]

1010
00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] Isomalt is going on.

1011
00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Er, blue, where's the blue?
Where's the blue gone?

1012
00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] I wish I had royal icing.

1013
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] That's the red.

1014
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:03.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hasn't come out how I wanted it.
This one keeps drooping down.

1015
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, bakers, your time is up.

1016
00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And breathe.
-[exhales heavily]

1017
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And we can breathe as well now.
-[chuckling] God.

1018
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whoa, man, you pulled off the DNA.
High fives to that.

1019
00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at that, beautiful.

1020
00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] I hope it didn't
fall down though.

1021
00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, no, no. Don't say that.

1022
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is more that I could've done,
but I'm happy with how it's turned out.

1023
00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1024
00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro] My red sugar just fell off.

1025
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Janusz] Oh, no.

1026

[Matt] <i>It's time to judge</i>

1027
00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Abdul, would you bring up
your showstopper, please?

1028
00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My hands are so sweaty right now.

1029
00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Please don't drop that.
-[chuckles]

1030
00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I think it looks absolutely magnificent.

1031
00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1032
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I love the little spaceman.

1033
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It looks great.
You managed to achieve

1034
00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the symmetry beautifully all the way down.
Got some nice detail in there.

1035
00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I love the isomalt windows.
-[Prue] Very clever.

1036
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It does feel like vandalism.

1037
00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Breaking it up.
-[laughs] Breaking things like that.

1038
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] All that work.

1039
00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[judges munching]

1040
00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the biscuit's delicious.

1041
00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's almond-y, it's chewy,
it's got a good colour.

1042
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So all these are marzipan?
These little stars.

1043
00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Abdul] Yes, they're all orange marzipan.

1044
00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm.

1045
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's delicious.
Is that made with essence or--

1046
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's orange zest in there,

1047
00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-as well as some essence.
-Tastes fresh.

1048
00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's really nice, that.

1049
00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Abdul, I think you've done a terrific job.

1050
00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, thank you.
-[Prue] Well done.

1051
00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's absolutely wonderful.

1052
00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Your design is amazing.
Colours are incredible.

1053
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] And the chromosomes,

1054
00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
are they actually supporting
the whole structure?

1055
00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-It is just amazing.

1056
00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Syabira] I made the base
with almond krokan,

1057
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the top with pistachios krokan.

1058
00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the flavours
are all absolutely spot on.

1059
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the baking varies.
Some of them are a little too dry.

1060
00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The main stand is okay.
It's chewy in the middle.

1061
00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pistachio tastes amazing,
almond tastes amazing.

1062
00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But they're both overbaked.

1063
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Syabira] Thank you.
-[judges] Thanks.

1064
00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispers] Well done, Syabira.

1065
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispers] Nicely done.

1066
00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the bottom tier
is beautifully neat, well-executed.

1067
00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The way you put
the different colours inside,

1068
00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it really works.

1069
00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just think it's slightly untidy
as you go up.

1070
00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The hearts are pretty even.

1071
00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But these ones are closer
together than those.

1072
00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Let's see what it tastes like.

1073
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. Delicious flavour.

1074
00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want to see if I can taste
the gin in the icing.

1075
00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course you do.

1076
00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Flavours are excellent.

1077
00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are a bit overbaked
and not chewy enough.

1078
00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The best bit I found was just here,
where it's a little bit softer.

1079
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's lost its crisp. You've gone from
slightly over to slightly under.

1080
00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we're trying to look
for something bang in the middle.

1081
00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do like it, it's mad.

1082
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's sort of all over the place
like a <i>Monty Python</i> krokan.

1083
00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] We have the whole of Africa here.

1084
00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] The whole of Africa.
I did red and blue isomalt

1085
00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
for the UK flag,
but the red isomalt fell off.

1086
00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It does look as if you've
overdone the caramel.

1087
00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Most definitely.
-[Prue] Like it's almost burnt.

1088
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandro chuckles]

1089
00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Mmm.
-[Paul] What's the tang in that?

1090
00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandro] Rhubarb and custard.
-[Paul] Mmm. Wow, yeah.

1091
00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] Africa is raspberry
and pistachio.

1092
00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's more raspberry than pistachio,

1093
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but the texture's beautiful.
-Okay.

1094
00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Every part
has got a softness to it.

1095
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which is exactly how it should be,
crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.

1096
00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chewy with flavour.

1097
00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just a little bit all over the place.

1098
00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] Yeah, I would've wanted it
a bit more finessed,

1099
00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-especially with being the week it is.
-Well done, Sandro.

1100
00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Thank you, Sandro.

1101
00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandro] It wasn't as bad
as I thought it would go.

1102
00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:49.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And for once, Paul actually seemed
really impressed with the flavour.

1103
00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles softly]

1104
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales deeply]

1105
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hopefully, I've done enough
to save myself a place in the finals.

1106
00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Janusz] I've got this feeling that
I am, today, in the bottom.

1107
00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know that pâtisserie is my weakness,
so it's gonna be a challenging decision.

1108
00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which one is going home?

1109
00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] That was an amazing showstopper.
-[Matt] Yeah

1110
00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All four of them did well.

1111
00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Syabira's helix looked extraordinary.

1112
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] I mean, that is
an insane idea, right? It's amazing.

1113
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Problem with that design is
you've got small bits of biscuit,

1114
00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it was slightly overbaked.

1115
00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She won the technical and had
a good signature, didn't she?

1116
00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Syabira has had a really good
couple of days.

1117
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then the same with Abdul, fantastic.

1118
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
His textures were all spot on.

1119
00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's Syabira or him, isn't it?
For Star Baker.

1120
00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] But by very virtue,
we're talking about

1121
00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Syabira and Abdul for Star Baker,

1122
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we are now looking
at Janusz and Sandro to go.

1123
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It comes down to little differences.

1124
00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can I just say as well,
this is the worst time…

1125
00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-…to go home.

1126
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-One of them has to.
-Yeah.

1127
00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's hold hands.
-[Sandro sighs]

1128
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matt] It's inconceivable to think that

1129
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we'll be saying goodbye
to one of you, but we will.

1130
00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Three of you have made it to the final
and one of you is Star Baker.

1131
00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And this week, the Star Baker is…

1132
00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Congratulations, Abdul.

1133
00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Syabira] Yes!
-Thank you, guys.

1134
00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[applause]

1135
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[groans] That means I've got
the horrible, horrible job

1136
00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
