worried about this week.

20
00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:08.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, partly ‘cause it’s the semi-final

21
00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:11.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but also it’s Patisserie and it’s French,
I don't really anything about it.

32
00:01:41.085 --> 00:01:42.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

42
00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:07.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a big part of pâtisserie.

43

I will find something from somewhere.

49
00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:26.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:30.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh, for your semi-final
Signature challenge,

51
00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:32.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the judges would like you to make
24 dipped madeleines.

52
00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:35.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, you need to make two batches
of 12 madeleines each

53
00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:38.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they need to be
two different designs and flavours.

54
00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:41.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

55
00:02:41.605 --> 00:02:44.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

57
00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:49.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

an extremely high standard.

58
00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:50.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Semi-final. Ah!

68
00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:11.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s weird, there just being, like,
4 of us, ‘cause there was 12.

69
00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:13.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, yeah, that is quite scary.

70
00:03:13.445 --> 00:03:14.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:14.805 --> 00:03:16.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, in India,
we don't even know what they are.

72

Madeleines, I think,
are deceptively difficult to do.

75
00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:28.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A perfect madeleine

00:03:31.765 --> 00:03:34.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

78
00:03:34.845 --> 00:03:37.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And on the other side there'll be a hump.

79
00:03:37.765 --> 00:03:41.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not a great camel's hump,
just a gentle rise.

80
00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:44.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ve got to get that batter right,
right from the start.

82
00:03:47.805 --> 00:03:49.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but before you put the batter in an oven,

00:03:49.765 --> 00:03:53.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>you’ve got to chill that batter down</i>

00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:55.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it blows up and this is what creates
a gorgeous bump.

85
00:03:55.685 --> 00:03:58.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We want all these madeleines
to look superb.

86
00:03:59.725 --> 00:04:02.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I’ve popped the madeleines
in in the freezer

87
00:04:02.205 --> 00:04:04.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because we’ve only got
a certain amount of time

88
00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:08.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and to get that bump you would normally
chill the batter overnight but...no, no.

00:13:27.205 --> 00:13:29.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ve got a good hump on you, Kim-Joy.
I’ll tell you that for nothing.

308
00:13:29.685 --> 00:13:31.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:51.765 --> 00:13:54.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

There’s lots of lines,

00:13:54.805 --> 00:13:56.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

313
00:13:56.525 --> 00:13:58.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s the perfect hump for this.

314
00:13:58.925 --> 00:14:00.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you think of these, Prue?

315
00:14:00.205 --> 00:14:01.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] When you see the two together

316
00:14:01.565 --> 00:14:03.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you think obviously
those have risen better.

317
00:14:03.365 --> 00:14:05.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. Yeah. It’s the same batter.
It’s just the raspberries.

318
00:14:05.605 --> 00:14:06.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:09.285 --> 00:14:10.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-That’s very good.

320
00:14:10.565 --> 00:14:13.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The raspberry perfectly balances
the white chocolate.

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:14.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:14.965 --> 00:14:17.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but to counter that you’ve managed
to put a raspberry in

323
00:14:17.365 --> 00:14:18.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

324
00:14:19.005 --> 00:14:21.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, well, let’s try the orange one
with the chocolate.

325
00:14:21.485 --> 00:14:24.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. It has a little bit of orange curd
in the middle.

326
00:14:24.885 --> 00:14:26.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

327
00:14:26.405 --> 00:14:27.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I can see that,
right in the middle.

328
00:14:31.045 --> 00:14:32.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s absolutely delicious.

329
00:14:32.525 --> 00:14:33.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

330
00:14:33.605 --> 00:14:35.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I mean, really good.
You’ve managed to put the feathering on.

331
00:14:35.485 --> 00:14:38.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The hazelnut really
marries well with it as well.

332
00:14:38.205 --> 00:14:39.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

337
00:14:48.885 --> 00:14:50.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop grimacing. Smile.

338
00:14:51.485 --> 00:14:52.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, crap.

339
00:14:56.205 --> 00:14:57.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hello, Ruby.
-Hello.

340

-Hey, Rubes.
-Hello, Rube.

341
00:15:08.525 --> 00:15:11.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They’re a little bit of a mess.
There’s a disaster on both of them.

342
00:15:11.525 --> 00:15:13.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks like it’s been fried almost.

343
00:15:14.125 --> 00:15:16.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Too much butter
on the inside of your tray.

344
00:15:16.365 --> 00:15:18.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not much of a hump.
-Yeah.

345
00:15:25.365 --> 00:15:28.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s got almost the texture
of a slightly under baked polenta cake.

346
00:15:28.405 --> 00:15:29.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s heavy.
-Right.

347
00:15:29.765 --> 00:15:31.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think your flavour's fantastic.
You have got orange.

348
00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:33.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You have got the stem ginger.
-Yeah.

349
00:15:34.005 --> 00:15:36.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s a shame it doesn’t look great
but the flavour of it's very good.

350
00:15:37.605 --> 00:15:38.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the one with the raspberry, in it?

351
00:15:38.645 --> 00:15:39.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

352
00:15:43.405 --> 00:15:46.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Same thing. Bit sad.
Flavour’s amazing though.

353
00:15:46.325 --> 00:15:47.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not your best.
-No.

354
00:15:49.685 --> 00:15:50.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flavour’s good.

355
00:15:50.685 --> 00:15:51.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] I mean, I’ll take that.

356
00:15:52.325 --> 00:15:54.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I’m being honest.
I’m gonna take that as a win.

357
00:16:03.165 --> 00:16:08.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like your rather zany icing
but we were looking for perfection.

358
00:16:08.205 --> 00:16:09.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The hump’s actually not bad.

359
00:16:09.405 --> 00:16:11.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It could be a little bit bigger
but it’s not bad.

360
00:16:13.645 --> 00:16:15.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That looks like nice sponge, doesn't it?

361
00:16:15.805 --> 00:16:16.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

362
00:16:18.685 --> 00:16:19.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m not getting the lime.

363
00:16:19.885 --> 00:16:21.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No? Okay. Just the mint?

364
00:16:21.525 --> 00:16:22.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. Struggling with the mint as well.

365
00:16:22.805 --> 00:16:23.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah.

366
00:16:23.805 --> 00:16:25.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you said that was vanilla,
I’d believe you.

367
00:16:25.605 --> 00:16:26.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, okay.

368
00:16:26.525 --> 00:16:28.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But espresso martini, surely,
-Surely. Hopefully.

369
00:16:28.525 --> 00:16:29.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that’s gonna be the one. Hmm?

370
00:16:29.645 --> 00:16:31.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Because this will be stronger?
[Briony] Yes.

371
00:16:35.165 --> 00:16:37.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hmm, I love the coffee bean flavour.
-Thank you.

372
00:16:37.645 --> 00:16:40.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s just delicious.
That sort of crunchy, strong coffee.

373
00:16:41.005 --> 00:16:43.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It’s a shame about the colour.
Think it is a little bit too dark.

374
00:16:43.125 --> 00:16:45.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Briony] Yeah.
-I think the flavour’s fantastic.

375
00:16:45.205 --> 00:16:46.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Lovely.
-Oh, good. Okay, thank you.

376
00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:55.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
As I expected, they’re beautifully iced

377
00:16:56.005 --> 00:16:57.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they’re very neat
and they’re very uniform.

378
00:16:57.965 --> 00:16:59.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I can see immediately that

379
00:17:00.005 --> 00:17:01.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you’ve got too much
baking powder in there.

380
00:17:01.365 --> 00:17:02.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You’ve got a big bump at the back.
-[Kim-Joy] That’s, that’s...

381
00:17:02.845 --> 00:17:04.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You see the way they’re almost...

382
00:17:04.445 --> 00:17:05.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it’s pregnant.

383
00:17:10.324 --> 00:17:12.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m not getting a massive amount
of flavour in that one.

384
00:17:12.805 --> 00:17:14.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You certainly get the citrus in the icing.

385
00:17:14.965 --> 00:17:16.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't get any flavour
from the madeleine itself.

386
00:17:16.725 --> 00:17:19.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s almost not enough sweetness
and not enough lemon.

387
00:17:19.604 --> 00:17:21.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Hmm. Be fascinating to see
what the other one’s like.

388
00:17:21.844 --> 00:17:22.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] And that’s the orange one.

389
00:17:23.005 --> 00:17:24.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] You can actually smell the orange.

390
00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:29.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The flavour’s much better.
-Okay.

391
00:17:29.485 --> 00:17:30.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beautiful orange in the sponge.

392
00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:32.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The orange icing compliments each other.

393
00:17:32.565 --> 00:17:33.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These ones I love.

394
00:17:33.565 --> 00:17:34.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah. Orange is a big hit.

395
00:17:34.965 --> 00:17:36.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So it’s just half good.
-Thank you.

396
00:17:37.085 --> 00:17:38.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. [laughs]

397
00:17:41.125 --> 00:17:43.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't know, I don't really know what
madeleines are meant to be like.

398
00:17:44.045 --> 00:17:45.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just thought
the bigger the hump the better.

00:17:45.965 --> 00:17:49.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Can I ask you something?
Why are people laughing about hump?

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:24.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are they up to today?

412
00:18:25.005 --> 00:18:26.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Prue is gonna give Paul a makeover.

-He wants to look like a geisha girl.

414
00:18:28.085 --> 00:18:29.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] That is not gonna be a stretch.

415
00:18:29.285 --> 00:18:33.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, for your Technical challenge
Prue would like you to make

416
00:18:33.205 --> 00:18:34.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a torta setteveli.

417
00:18:35.205 --> 00:18:38.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This pâtisserie must be comprised
of seven layers.

418
00:18:39.045 --> 00:18:41.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Two light chocolate Genoese sponges,

419
00:18:41.885 --> 00:18:44.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a silky smooth hazelnut bavarois,

420
00:18:44.725 --> 00:18:48.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a crunchy praline base

421
00:18:48.285 --> 00:18:49.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Quite a lot of words there I think
you didn’t know what they meant.

422
00:18:49.645 --> 00:18:50.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Most of them.

423
00:18:50.925 --> 00:18:54.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have three and a half hours
for this almost impossible task.

424
00:18:54.605 --> 00:18:56.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

425
00:18:56.165 --> 00:18:57.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake!

426
00:18:59.085 --> 00:19:00.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my good Lord.

427
00:19:00.645 --> 00:19:02.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] Never heard of it. Never made it.

428
00:19:02.165 --> 00:19:03.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t know what half the elements are.

429
00:19:03.605 --> 00:19:05.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s the kinda thing you’d see
in a shop and think,

430
00:19:05.605 --> 00:19:07.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Wow, that’s complicated.

431
00:19:08.205 --> 00:19:09.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I won’t bother making that."

432
00:19:09.925 --> 00:19:11.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really don't like Technicals.

433
00:19:13.245 --> 00:19:15.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, Prue, torta setteveli.

434
00:19:15.805 --> 00:19:18.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What a fantastic looking cake
for the semi-finals.

435
00:19:18.565 --> 00:19:19.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I know, it’s beautiful, isn’t it?

436
00:19:20.165 --> 00:19:22.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In English, it’s called
the seven veils cake.

437
00:19:22.205 --> 00:19:25.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, it’s an absolute indulgent,
decadent feast.

438
00:19:26.045 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let’s have a look at these layers,
shall we?

439
00:19:27.205 --> 00:19:28.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I know, I’m so excited about them.

440
00:19:28.605 --> 00:19:29.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Look at that.

441
00:19:29.645 --> 00:19:32.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It has two layers
of chocolate Genoese

442
00:19:33.245 --> 00:19:35.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and two layers of hazelnut bavarois,

443
00:19:36.205 --> 00:19:41.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a praline crunch layer
and a chocolate mousse on the top.

444
00:19:41.325 --> 00:19:43.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where can they go wrong with this cake?

445
00:19:43.085 --> 00:19:45.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The main problem will be timing as always

446
00:19:46.045 --> 00:19:49.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because this cake is in
and out of the freezer,

447
00:19:49.165 --> 00:19:50.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so that the next layer will set.

448
00:19:51.525 --> 00:19:54.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then at the end,
we want this perfect mirror glaze.

449
00:19:54.885 --> 00:19:57.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has to be just set and silky.

450
00:19:57.645 --> 00:19:58.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s gorgeous.

451
00:19:58.845 --> 00:20:02.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even a professional pâtissier
would be under huge pressure

452
00:20:03.005 --> 00:20:05.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to produce this.
We are asking the near impossible.

453
00:20:06.405 --> 00:20:08.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It says to make the Genoese batter.

454
00:20:09.045 --> 00:20:11.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Try and get as much air into it
as you possibly can.

455
00:20:13.165 --> 00:20:14.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] Gotta watch everyone.

456
00:20:14.325 --> 00:20:15.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everyone’s on their game, you know.

457
00:20:16.325 --> 00:20:17.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Especially that guy.

458
00:20:19.565 --> 00:20:22.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That looks super.
It’s really holding its shape.

459
00:20:23.805 --> 00:20:25.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Briony] So I’ve got to very carefully
fold this flour

460
00:20:25.925 --> 00:20:27.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and cocoa into the eggs and sugar.

461
00:20:28.445 --> 00:20:31.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope that’s okay. I’m a bit worried now.

462
00:20:31.165 --> 00:20:33.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just hope I’ve not knocked out
too much air now.

463
00:20:34.885 --> 00:20:35.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Bake."

464
00:20:37.605 --> 00:20:39.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, 25 minutes I think.

465
00:20:40.805 --> 00:20:41.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
God, I’m so hot already.

466
00:20:42.965 --> 00:20:46.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"For the praline, toast the hazelnuts
and make praline."

467
00:20:46.685 --> 00:20:48.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] I love an instruction like that.

468
00:20:48.685 --> 00:20:50.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kim-Joy] I’ve never actually
made a praline

469
00:20:50.445 --> 00:20:53.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you just make a caramel
and chuck it over the nuts. [laughs]

470
00:20:54.285 --> 00:20:56.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] Come on. Cool quickly.

471
00:20:57.245 --> 00:20:58.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"When the praline is set, make a paste."

472
00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:00.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I guess you just blend it all up.

473
00:21:02.925 --> 00:21:05.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Briony] Right, so that’s
the praline paste.

474
00:21:05.125 --> 00:21:07.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m just onto the hazelnut bavarois now.
What’s a bavarois?

475
00:21:07.965 --> 00:21:08.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Someone tell me.

476
00:21:09.085 --> 00:21:11.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s basically custard set with gelatine.

477
00:21:11.845 --> 00:21:13.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do you know what a bavarois is?
-No.

478
00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:14.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I’m the only one in here
that doesn’t.

479
00:21:14.645 --> 00:21:16.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think so. Noel and I
are leading the way

480
00:21:16.885 --> 00:21:17.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

481
00:21:17.885 --> 00:21:19.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, but you guys present. You’re not...

482
00:21:19.285 --> 00:21:20.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We’re not bavarois people?

483
00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re not supposed to be bavarois people.
You don't have to be.

484
00:21:22.445 --> 00:21:23.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. It’s a good name for a band though,

-Bavarois People.

00:21:26.365 --> 00:21:29.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:22:03.005 --> 00:22:03.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:47.965 --> 00:24:49.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:53.645 --> 00:24:57.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Basically whisk cocoa powder

564
00:24:57.165 --> 00:25:00.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
sugar and water and bring them to a boil.

565
00:25:01.005 --> 00:25:03.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gotta add in the gelatine now.
Big blob of gelatine.

00:25:04.325 --> 00:25:05.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

567
00:25:06.725 --> 00:25:08.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

570
00:25:15.445 --> 00:25:16.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

571
00:25:17.085 --> 00:25:18.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

572
00:25:18.805 --> 00:25:20.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:25:22.645 --> 00:25:25.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:27:55.125 --> 00:27:56.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very dark chocolate that.

00:28:01.605 --> 00:28:04.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Fairly even as well, aren’t they?

00:28:07.885 --> 00:28:08.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

It’s sort of PVC overcoat.

00:28:12.725 --> 00:28:14.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:22.005 --> 00:28:23.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:23.165 --> 00:28:24.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it’s right over.

640
00:28:24.245 --> 00:28:26.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] But what does it look like inside?

641
00:28:27.285 --> 00:28:29.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Prue] The mousse layer is delicious.
[Paul] Bavarois good.

643
00:28:35.285 --> 00:28:38.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] If you look at this, this thing
you can just pull away and it melts.

644
00:28:38.685 --> 00:28:40.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s soft and edible. That is very nice.

645
00:28:41.525 --> 00:28:43.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Right, moving on.

646
00:28:43.445 --> 00:28:46.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is a shine and it sort of covers
all of it, so it looks fairly neat.

647
00:28:46.845 --> 00:28:50.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But obviously the chocolate went on
when the mousse wasn't quite set enough.

648
00:28:50.685 --> 00:28:52.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you’ve got a bit of marbling there.

649
00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:55.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh, very nice layers.

650
00:28:56.605 --> 00:28:58.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Although where’s the mousse?

651
00:28:59.645 --> 00:29:01.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That mousse seems to have blended in
with the top, hasn't it?

652
00:29:02.485 --> 00:29:03.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yes, there is very little mousse.

653
00:29:03.565 --> 00:29:05.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That mousse is very thin.

654
00:29:07.725 --> 00:29:11.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hmm. Good praline.
Nice bavarois. Not enough mousse.

655
00:29:12.325 --> 00:29:13.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. Now there’s obviously been

656
00:29:14.005 --> 00:29:15.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
serious issues
with this chocolate mixture.

657
00:29:15.765 --> 00:29:18.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There was obviously a bit of a rush
near the end.

658
00:29:18.085 --> 00:29:19.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s got a nice shine to it though.

659
00:29:22.765 --> 00:29:24.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] This is nearly as dark
as that first one.

660
00:29:24.605 --> 00:29:26.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] It is. Yeah, I know.
-And as rubbery.

661
00:29:28.805 --> 00:29:29.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

662
00:29:31.765 --> 00:29:33.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can’t eat that chocolate coating,
it’s too rubbery.

663
00:29:35.285 --> 00:29:38.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>Paul and Prue will now rank</i>

664
00:29:39.325 --> 00:29:41.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, in fourth spot

665
00:29:43.045 --> 00:29:43.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is this one.

666
00:29:44.005 --> 00:29:45.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s me again.

667
00:29:45.285 --> 00:29:48.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rahul, you didn't cover the whole cake
with the chocolate mixture

668
00:29:48.325 --> 00:29:49.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it was a bit like rubber.

669
00:29:50.285 --> 00:29:52.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In third place, we have this one.

670
00:29:52.965 --> 00:29:55.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Briony, you know the outside
was very rubbery.

671
00:29:55.365 --> 00:29:56.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Got that. Yep.

00:29:58.365 --> 00:30:00.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

673
00:30:01.245 --> 00:30:02.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

674
00:30:03.645 --> 00:30:05.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I actually quite like this cake.
The layers were very neat,

675
00:30:06.405 --> 00:30:08.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
although, there’s very little mousse
there at all.

676
00:30:08.885 --> 00:30:12.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't have much time at the end
so I put the mousse on,

677
00:30:12.285 --> 00:30:14.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
put the glaze on, that’s why
it’s kind of merged a bit.

678
00:30:14.765 --> 00:30:17.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But nevertheless, it did taste good
and it looked pretty elegant too.

679
00:30:18.245 --> 00:30:20.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which means that this is number one.

680
00:30:20.765 --> 00:30:21.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] Yay, Ruby.

681
00:30:22.725 --> 00:30:24.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

682
00:30:24.685 --> 00:30:26.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Layers were delicious.
It’s a beautiful cake.

683
00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:27.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

684
00:30:27.965 --> 00:30:29.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened there then?

685
00:30:30.205 --> 00:30:32.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I’m really surprised at that.</i>
<i>Never made a bavarois before.</i>

687
00:30:33.605 --> 00:30:35.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I cannot believe I got second.

689
00:30:38.285 --> 00:30:43.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought about giving up for about
ten seconds then I was, like, no.

690
00:30:46.405 --> 00:30:47.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

691
00:30:48.525 --> 00:30:51.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As soon as something good happens,
something bad just comes behind it.

00:30:54.125 --> 00:30:57.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

be on the Showstopper tomorrow.

00:31:10.725 --> 00:31:12.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue] Yeah, exactly.

00:31:12.925 --> 00:31:15.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:19.445 --> 00:31:20.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:21.525 --> 00:31:23.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:35.525 --> 00:31:37.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

714
00:31:41.285 --> 00:31:43.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:43.085 --> 00:31:44.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:59.405 --> 00:33:02.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:03.925 --> 00:33:05.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’d definitely say
this was the toughest challenge,

750

00:33:07.165 --> 00:33:08.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

752
00:33:08.445 --> 00:33:10.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but there’s literally no time
to stop in that five hours.

753
00:33:11.005 --> 00:33:12.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:12.285 --> 00:33:15.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:25.125 --> 00:33:28.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:28.445 --> 00:33:32.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

760
00:33:33.085 --> 00:33:35.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:37.605 --> 00:33:40.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

763
00:33:40.085 --> 00:33:41.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:41.885 --> 00:33:46.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:44:31.845 --> 00:44:32.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s basically a brush.

1030
00:44:33.045 --> 00:44:33.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For painting pastry?

1031
00:44:34.045 --> 00:44:34.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Something like that.

1032
00:44:35.045 --> 00:44:36.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-For brushing pastry?
-Yeah.

1033
00:44:36.245 --> 00:44:38.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like a toothbrush but longer?

1034
00:44:38.765 --> 00:44:39.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll ask someone else.

1035
00:44:39.925 --> 00:44:40.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1036
00:44:41.045 --> 00:44:43.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know that I can actually
able to glaze my tarts.

1037
00:44:43.565 --> 00:44:45.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Might just have to leave it like that.

1038
00:44:45.725 --> 00:44:49.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I definitely can't do the feathering
on top. I just got no time.

1039
00:44:49.325 --> 00:44:51.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, bakers, five minutes,
just five minutes

1040
00:44:52.045 --> 00:44:53.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of the five hours are left.

1041
00:45:04.125 --> 00:45:05.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] These are edible flowers.

1042
00:45:11.365 --> 00:45:13.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] What an epic disaster this is.

1043
00:45:18.205 --> 00:45:20.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know they look rubbish
but just gonna have to do.

1044
00:45:22.685 --> 00:45:25.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For God’s sake. Please stick.
Please stick. Please stick.

1045
00:45:25.485 --> 00:45:28.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, your time is up.
Please step away from your bakes.

1046
00:45:29.405 --> 00:45:31.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh.
-Well done.

1047
00:45:35.085 --> 00:45:37.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Briony] Well, that’s what
I call a mighty cock-up.

1048
00:45:39.365 --> 00:45:40.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] Oh, my God.

1049
00:45:42.485 --> 00:45:43.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] Wow,

1050
00:45:44.605 --> 00:45:45.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they look incredible.

1051
00:45:50.885 --> 00:45:53.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>The semi-finalists’</i>

00:45:53.925 --> 00:45:56.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1053
00:46:13.805 --> 00:46:17.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The whole thing about French pâtisserie
is about how delicate they are,

1054
00:46:17.885 --> 00:46:19.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
how small they are.

1055
00:46:19.365 --> 00:46:21.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are all quite chunky
and in fact, I look round,

1056
00:46:21.485 --> 00:46:22.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and there’s a lot of big stuff here

1057
00:46:23.045 --> 00:46:25.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I wouldn't necessarily
agree with the size.

1058
00:46:25.245 --> 00:46:28.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can almost half every one of these.
It's all about delicacy.

1059
00:46:28.525 --> 00:46:31.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s about punching a big flavour
in a small exquisite cake.

1060
00:46:31.405 --> 00:46:33.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, let’s start with the mille-feuille.

1061
00:46:35.165 --> 00:46:37.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A dry top on mille-feuille?

1062
00:46:37.445 --> 00:46:39.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know. I ran out of time. I’m so sorry.

1063
00:46:39.605 --> 00:46:40.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks very dull.

1064
00:46:41.125 --> 00:46:42.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know.

1065
00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:49.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could have cooked it a little longer.

1066
00:46:49.965 --> 00:46:54.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you do a mille-feuille the pastry
has to be totally crisp.

1067
00:46:54.285 --> 00:46:57.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The good news, Kim-Joy, is that
the flavour is absolutely wonderful.

1068
00:46:57.965 --> 00:46:58.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah.

1069
00:46:58.925 --> 00:47:01.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] And these,
I don't like the look of them.

1070
00:47:01.325 --> 00:47:03.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They’re all broken up.
What you should have done

1071
00:47:03.245 --> 00:47:06.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is chosen the Italian meringue
and then blowtorched it.

1072
00:47:09.485 --> 00:47:11.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pastry’s lovely and I love the filling.

1073
00:47:11.925 --> 00:47:14.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, let’s move onto the choux.

1074
00:47:14.725 --> 00:47:17.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They don't look too bad.
Maybe a little bit burnt in places.

1075
00:47:17.205 --> 00:47:18.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, it’s caught a little bit.

1076
00:47:18.125 --> 00:47:19.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It’s a little bit dark, isn’t it?

1077
00:47:20.085 --> 00:47:22.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, that’s a terrible way to kill a nun.

1078
00:47:22.245 --> 00:47:23.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1079
00:47:25.005 --> 00:47:27.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One of the real difficulties
with choux pastry

1080
00:47:27.485 --> 00:47:30.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is filling it properly
and that’s properly filled.

1081
00:47:35.485 --> 00:47:38.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It has got a nice orange flavour.
It is quite tart and I like that.

1082
00:47:38.925 --> 00:47:40.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I don't agree
with the craquelin though.

1083
00:47:40.565 --> 00:47:44.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Problem is when you bake with craquelin
is when you’re baking it,

1084
00:47:44.325 --> 00:47:46.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it colours quicker
than the actual choux itself

1085
00:47:46.765 --> 00:47:48.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and so you bring it out the oven
thinking it’s ready

1086
00:47:48.725 --> 00:47:50.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that’s not necessarily the case.

1087
00:47:50.685 --> 00:47:53.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think overall the idea
was there on all of them

1088
00:47:53.165 --> 00:47:55.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I think the execution hasn't been
as good as it could have been.

1089
00:47:55.485 --> 00:47:56.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

1090
00:48:08.125 --> 00:48:12.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I must say they are very pretty
and beautifully decorated,

1091
00:48:12.965 --> 00:48:15.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would say with the exception
of the Saint-Honorés.

1092
00:48:15.205 --> 00:48:16.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the caramel is much too thick.

1093
00:48:16.645 --> 00:48:19.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the idea but again
they’re just too big

1094
00:48:19.245 --> 00:48:21.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and these are huge.
-Okay. Yeah.

1095
00:48:21.205 --> 00:48:23.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, um, it’s all down to the bake now
and flavour.

1096
00:48:24.685 --> 00:48:27.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The puff pastry looks
really nicely baked

1097
00:48:27.525 --> 00:48:30.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I’m hoping that it will be
not soft in the middle.

1098
00:48:31.445 --> 00:48:33.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These layers are very good.
They’re very well baked.

1099
00:48:33.765 --> 00:48:36.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is not a wet bit in there at all.

1100
00:48:36.725 --> 00:48:38.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s just dry and it’s flaking.
That’s how it should be.

1101
00:48:38.805 --> 00:48:39.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Beautiful.
-Thank you.

1102
00:48:40.445 --> 00:48:41.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Really good.

1103
00:48:42.045 --> 00:48:43.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the mint.

1104
00:48:43.245 --> 00:48:45.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The mint is just delicious.
-It’s delicate, isn’t it?

1105
00:48:45.085 --> 00:48:45.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Delicious.

1106
00:48:46.605 --> 00:48:47.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-Okay.

1107
00:48:48.125 --> 00:48:50.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Next one.
What is the pastry underneath?

1108
00:48:50.965 --> 00:48:51.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s a shortbread.

1109
00:48:57.165 --> 00:48:58.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Flavour’s delicious.

1110
00:48:58.445 --> 00:48:59.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is clever.
The choux buns are baked well.

1111
00:49:00.485 --> 00:49:01.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour in there is pretty good.

1112
00:49:01.765 --> 00:49:02.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] And the chocolate filling’s lovely.

1113
00:49:03.165 --> 00:49:04.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your base is fantastic,

1114
00:49:04.645 --> 00:49:07.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
‘cause that is just crispy
all the way through.

1115
00:49:07.085 --> 00:49:08.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you’ve done a good job with that.

1116
00:49:09.685 --> 00:49:10.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pipe work’s good,

1117
00:49:11.125 --> 00:49:12.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the choice of meringue is good

1118
00:49:13.165 --> 00:49:15.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I don't like fruit that’s unglazed.

1119
00:49:16.045 --> 00:49:18.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Ruby] Okay.
-Any fruit that’s unglazed looks

1120
00:49:18.165 --> 00:49:19.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
unfinished.

1121
00:49:26.645 --> 00:49:30.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That lemon curd is so powerful
and so strong.

1122
00:49:30.445 --> 00:49:32.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s verbena. It’s that concentrate.
-[Ruby] Yeah.

1123
00:49:32.205 --> 00:49:33.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s a strong flavour.

1124
00:49:33.405 --> 00:49:35.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you'd had maybe a raspberry coulis

1125
00:49:35.725 --> 00:49:38.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that would have been enough
because the pastry’s baked really well.

1126
00:49:47.965 --> 00:49:50.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This pastry looks a little bit thick.

1127
00:49:50.365 --> 00:49:53.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, we’re looking for delicacy
and this is massive.

1128
00:49:53.125 --> 00:49:54.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, this is colossal.

1129
00:49:54.765 --> 00:49:56.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It just looks a bit clumsy, doesn't it?

1130
00:49:56.245 --> 00:49:57.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] Yeah. No, I agree.

1131
00:49:59.405 --> 00:50:02.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, dear the mousse has run.
Oh, dear. Yeah.

00:50:05.045 --> 00:50:07.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Potent flavours. The flavours are okay.

1133
00:50:07.485 --> 00:50:09.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your tart case is quite chewy.

1134
00:50:09.485 --> 00:50:10.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, right, okay.

1135
00:50:10.605 --> 00:50:12.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And...
-Too thick.

1136
00:50:12.605 --> 00:50:13.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] These look okay.

1137
00:50:13.605 --> 00:50:15.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they were smaller,
they would be really nice.

1138
00:50:15.725 --> 00:50:17.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I could see that in a Parisian shop.

1139
00:50:17.605 --> 00:50:19.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Briony] I’m sorry about...
-What are these filled with?

1140
00:50:19.165 --> 00:50:20.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn’t have time to fill them.
I’m really sorry.

1141
00:50:20.445 --> 00:50:22.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So this is just plain pastry with...
What’s this?

1142
00:50:22.645 --> 00:50:23.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. That’s lemon crème pat.

1143
00:50:23.605 --> 00:50:25.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite a lot of salt in the pastry.

1144
00:50:25.325 --> 00:50:26.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, really?

1145
00:50:26.845 --> 00:50:27.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah, it’s very salty.

1146
00:50:27.925 --> 00:50:30.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I probably put two teaspoons of salt in
instead of sugar the way today went.

1147
00:50:30.925 --> 00:50:31.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

1148
00:50:32.085 --> 00:50:35.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] And then the mille-feuille,
your pastry is raw.

1149
00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:36.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. Yes.

1150
00:50:37.405 --> 00:50:38.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is very raw.
-Yeah.

1151
00:50:40.725 --> 00:50:43.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Coffee crème pat, it's got a nice flavour
but you’ve cooked it too much.

1152
00:50:43.205 --> 00:50:44.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, okay.
-[Prue] I like those flavours,

1153
00:50:45.085 --> 00:50:46.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with the caramel particularly it’s nice

1154
00:50:46.685 --> 00:50:49.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but, um, it’s actually also quite salty.

1155
00:50:49.165 --> 00:50:50.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe you were thinking salted caramel.

1156
00:50:50.925 --> 00:50:52.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Did you mix
your salt and sugar up today?

1157
00:50:52.365 --> 00:50:53.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know, maybe I did. Sorry.

1158
00:50:53.725 --> 00:50:55.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Briony, don't say sorry to us.

1159
00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:57.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, it’s to you you have to say sorry

1160
00:50:57.405 --> 00:50:59.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-‘cause you can do much better than this.
-I know I can.

1161
00:50:59.725 --> 00:51:01.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And this was not the time to get it wrong.

1162
00:51:14.245 --> 00:51:16.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can’t put that in a shop
when it’s not finished.

1163
00:51:17.725 --> 00:51:20.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To glaze them at the end of this
would have taken you,

1164
00:51:20.685 --> 00:51:23.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-minute? If that. If that.
-[Rahul] Yeah.

1165
00:51:23.605 --> 00:51:25.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And after five hours, you couldn't do it.

1166
00:51:32.725 --> 00:51:37.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is an absolutely classic
French tartlet without the glaze.

1167
00:51:38.245 --> 00:51:41.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the flavours are good.
I think your base is a little bit thick.

1168
00:51:41.085 --> 00:51:43.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, we’ll try the éclair.

1169
00:51:44.645 --> 00:51:46.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They’re probably not completely full.

1170
00:51:52.685 --> 00:51:53.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the flavour’s lovely.

1171
00:51:53.885 --> 00:51:57.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That has got a bit of salt in it too
but not too much.

1172
00:51:57.445 --> 00:52:00.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pastry’s a little soft
but I think it’s about right.

1173
00:52:00.685 --> 00:52:02.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the top isn’t very neat.

1174
00:52:03.125 --> 00:52:04.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Rahul] No.
-Caramel’s all over the place.

1175
00:52:05.885 --> 00:52:08.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't like the flavours. It’s boring.

1176
00:52:09.245 --> 00:52:10.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It really is boring.

1177
00:52:10.485 --> 00:52:12.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wouldn't go as far as to say it’s boring

1178
00:52:12.725 --> 00:52:15.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it’s certainly not the most exciting
éclair I’ve ever eaten.

1179
00:52:15.805 --> 00:52:17.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] This one here is the one
that worries me the most.

1180
00:52:17.685 --> 00:52:18.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1181
00:52:22.165 --> 00:52:23.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Oh, great flavour.

1182
00:52:24.085 --> 00:52:24.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

1183
00:52:25.165 --> 00:52:26.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't think I was gonna
like that at all.

1184
00:52:26.685 --> 00:52:27.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s delicious.

1185
00:52:28.125 --> 00:52:29.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really good.

1186
00:52:29.365 --> 00:52:32.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks hideous but it tastes amazing.

1187
00:52:32.605 --> 00:52:33.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1188
00:52:33.565 --> 00:52:35.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] With that cream inside
and the blueberries

1189
00:52:35.325 --> 00:52:37.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and with that bite coming from the curd

1190
00:52:38.005 --> 00:52:39.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is just stunning, isn’t it?

1191
00:52:39.845 --> 00:52:41.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Rahul.
-[Prue] Hmm. Thank you, Rahul.

1192
00:52:53.765 --> 00:52:55.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, so semi-final.

1193
00:52:55.685 --> 00:52:57.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Parisian window.
Is this what you imagined?

1194
00:52:57.805 --> 00:53:00.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Some of them were nearly there,
they had all the elements.

1195
00:53:00.165 --> 00:53:01.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But some of them were way off the mark.</i>

1196
00:53:01.805 --> 00:53:03.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rahul hasn't had a particularly good day.

1197
00:53:03.925 --> 00:53:07.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right, the pastry tastes all right
but it looks terrible.

1198
00:53:07.205 --> 00:53:08.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know what’s happened to him

1199
00:53:08.765 --> 00:53:10.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because he’s definitely gone
a bit backwards.

1200
00:53:10.405 --> 00:53:11.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s talk about Briony for a minute.

1201
00:53:11.645 --> 00:53:13.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] <i>I was really surprised </i>

1202
00:53:13.485 --> 00:53:16.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because Briony knew that today was the day

1203
00:53:16.325 --> 00:53:17.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
she had to pull out all the stops

1204
00:53:17.885 --> 00:53:21.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and usually that’s the sort of challenge
that makes her do her best stuff.

1205
00:53:22.085 --> 00:53:24.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn’t help if your salt
and your sugar get confused.

1206
00:53:24.525 --> 00:53:26.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I’m not a baker
but I’m gonna guess...

1207
00:53:27.045 --> 00:53:29.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that’s exactly what happened.

1208
00:53:29.725 --> 00:53:31.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I think Ruby overall has done well.</i>

1209
00:53:31.605 --> 00:53:32.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the idea of the choux,

1210
00:53:33.045 --> 00:53:35.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the, the Saint-Honorés
with the biscuit base

1211
00:53:35.605 --> 00:53:36.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
‘cause actually that worked.

1212
00:53:36.965 --> 00:53:41.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It had fabulous flavours
and that pastry was beautiful

1213
00:53:41.285 --> 00:53:42.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I think it looks awful.

1214
00:53:42.965 --> 00:53:45.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think, uh, the idea of the religieuses,

1215
00:53:45.525 --> 00:53:47.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which Kim-Joy did was pretty good.

1216
00:53:47.525 --> 00:53:49.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavours were there.
I just... on a personal opinion,

1217
00:53:49.245 --> 00:53:50.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I didn't like the craquelin on the top.</i>

1218
00:53:50.885 --> 00:53:53.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if I had to choose
one of all of these things to eat...

1219
00:53:53.365 --> 00:53:54.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, which one?

1220
00:53:54.325 --> 00:53:55.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s probably the one
that looks the worst,

1221
00:53:55.765 --> 00:54:00.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is Rahul’s mille-feuille.
It was sensational flavour.

1222
00:54:00.445 --> 00:54:01.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Shall I go for it? Is it good?
-Yeah, it’s delicious.

1223
00:54:02.285 --> 00:54:03.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go on.

1224
00:54:04.205 --> 00:54:05.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can’t get it into your mouth.

1225
00:54:05.605 --> 00:54:08.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, they’re big for Sandi.
These are like double-decker buses.

1226
00:54:09.565 --> 00:54:11.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-That’s the biggest thing I’ve ever eaten.

1227
00:54:11.365 --> 00:54:12.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You won’t have to eat again now
until next week.

1228
00:54:13.085 --> 00:54:14.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. No. That’s it.

1229
00:54:23.925 --> 00:54:27.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well done, my lovely bakers,
getting through the semi-final.

1230
00:54:27.525 --> 00:54:29.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve got the good job
this week of announcing

1231
00:54:30.245 --> 00:54:31.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the Star Baker.

1232
00:54:32.245 --> 00:54:35.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The person who is this week’s Star Baker

1233
00:54:35.765 --> 00:54:39.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and who will definitely
be going through to the final is...

1234
00:54:44.845 --> 00:54:45.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ruby.

1235
00:54:49.925 --> 00:54:50.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I knew it.

On a roll, baby girl. On a roll.

00:54:54.805 --> 00:54:56.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So my job now
is to be completely professional

1239
00:54:56.805 --> 00:54:58.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and not cry at all.

1240
00:54:58.325 --> 00:55:01.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh, it’s tricky because, uh,
we are so fond

1241
00:55:02.485 --> 00:55:05.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of all of you and the person
who is going home

1242
00:55:05.805 --> 00:55:09.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
has been a complete force of nature
in this tent.

1243
00:55:10.925 --> 00:55:12.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I’m afraid the person who is...

1244
00:55:13.805 --> 00:55:15.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...not going through to the final...

1245
00:55:19.165 --> 00:55:20.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...is Briony.

1246
00:55:20.205 --> 00:55:21.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s okay. It’s okay.
-I’m so sorry.

1247
00:55:21.525 --> 00:55:22.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s okay. It’s okay.
That was the right decision.

1248
00:55:22.965 --> 00:55:25.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1249
00:55:25.125 --> 00:55:28.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s okay. Thank you for you kind words.
It’s okay.

1250
00:55:28.725 --> 00:55:30.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[voice breaking] Sad to not be
going through to the final

1251
00:55:30.165 --> 00:55:32.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but so happy with how far I’ve come.

1252
00:55:32.885 --> 00:55:36.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like, my God, in so many ways.
What an experience.

1253
00:55:36.485 --> 00:55:37.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God, my musketeer.

1254
00:55:38.165 --> 00:55:39.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobody wanted to see Briony go

1255
00:55:39.885 --> 00:55:43.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because she has been
so good at coming back

1256
00:55:43.325 --> 00:55:44.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when things have gone wrong.

1257
00:55:44.805 --> 00:55:48.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I still love baking.
I love baking more than ever.

1258
00:55:48.685 --> 00:55:50.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Knowing that I can do
more than I ever thought I could.

1259
00:55:50.805 --> 00:55:53.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't often say that I’m proud of myself
but I am. I’m proud of myself.

[Rahul] <i>Can’t believe that.</i>

00:55:56.725 --> 00:55:59.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The person who never baked a single cake

1262
00:55:59.565 --> 00:56:01.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-[Briony] Well done, guys. Come here.
-Oh, guys.

1264
00:56:03.685 --> 00:56:06.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I actually think there’s gonna be
a fantastic final next week.

1265
00:56:06.245 --> 00:56:07.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>We’ve got three great bakers. </i>

1266
00:56:07.525 --> 00:56:10.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Each one of them</i>

1267
00:56:10.325 --> 00:56:11.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If they bring their A game,

1268
00:56:11.845 --> 00:56:14.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that is gonna be the best final ever,
I promise you.

1269
00:56:14.245 --> 00:56:17.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I bet you’re shocked. You’re shocked.
You can tell me.

1270
00:56:17.725 --> 00:56:19.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was hoping Ruby would get Star Baker

1271
00:56:19.405 --> 00:56:20.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
‘cause then we’ve all got two Star Bakers.

1272
00:56:21.245 --> 00:56:24.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it must be, like,
the most evenly balanced final ever.

1273
00:56:25.925 --> 00:56:26.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right?
