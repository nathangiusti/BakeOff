<c.bg_transparent>-Was this warm when you put it all in?</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>-It was to the wire, yeah.</c.bg_transparent>

535
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

<c.bg_transparent>It tastes like rhubarb and custard.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>I love it.</c.bg_transparent>

537
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

<c.bg_transparent>The flavour's lovely.</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>I think the texture is wrong.</c.bg_transparent>

539

<c.bg_transparent>but it doesn't show up</c.bg_transparent>

542
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<c.bg_transparent>I actually really like the flavour,</c.bg_transparent>

546
00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<c.bg_transparent>What I think is so lovely</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>my cold butter this morning.</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>It is the butter.</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>The sponge itself,</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>It looks like a roulade</c.bg_transparent>

<c.bg_transparent>That is one</c.bg_transparent>
<c.bg_transparent>mighty impressive-looking Swiss roll.</c.bg_transparent>

577
