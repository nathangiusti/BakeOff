It's Party Week, and the signature
challenge is my favourite challenge ever,

77
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
sausage rolls.

78
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] I've practised this at home.

79
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't want to say,
"They will be consistent",

80
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause that means today,
they're gonna be horrendous.

81
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] We've said they can make
any pastry they like.

82
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, I think, most of them
will do a rough puff.

83
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a shorter way of doing puff pastry
'cause puff pastry takes hours.

84
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's hot today in the tent
and butter's gonna melt very quickly.

85
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They'll have to use that fridge,
keep it chilled all the time

86
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
up until the moment it's in the oven.

87
00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that will create the lamination,
flake and butteriness that you need

88
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] Next we go onto
the sausage filling.

90
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When it comes to flavours,
it's gotta pack a punch.

91
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want that little bit of moisture
in there, don't want it too dry or claggy.

92
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry won't have much flavour to it,
so the filling needs to stand out.

93
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can't beat a good sausage roll.

I'm looking forward to.

97
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, Cristy, tell us all about
your sausage rolls.

Hello, Dan. Is this sausage roll
gonna bring the party today?

200
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hopefully so, yes.

201
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I went to Ibiza when I was 20.
I've finally recovered.

203
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My party now,
I'm in bed by about eight o'clock.

204
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Me too, you're exactly like me.
-[laughing]

205
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-My party is in my bed.
-Yeah, I like, er, yeah… [laughs]

206
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you are halfway through.

207
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was powerful.

208

-Thank you.

[Tasha] It's time to roll.
Nice and chilled.

210
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] I'm looking for about 60 centimetres
and then 15 wide.

211
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I've got enough pastry
to fold it over then hopefully.

212
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Cristy] It's so cold. [laughs]

213
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gone quite stiff.

214
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I can't have it thick,
'cause it'll just be not nice.

215
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't know about you, but I like
a thick pastry on a sausage roll.

216
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tasha] The apricot sauce is gonna go on.

217
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is hot so I'll have to work quickly.

218
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Cristy] Go, go.

219
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Good fun, isn't it?

220
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] Spread cranberry sauce
on the inside.

221
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A nice bit of sweetness
to cut through that savoury filling.

222
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm being generous with the sausage.
No one wants a small sausage.

223
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Want a good mouthful, yeah.

224
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll give myself enough filling
to have absolutely no excuses.

225
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matty] This is the caramelised onions.

226
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] I like to make them individually.
Helps me keep it uniform.

227
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just trying to get it sort of
as equal as humanely possible.

228
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] I'm pleased with the pastry,
looks nice.

229
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] Right egg wash, sesame seeds,
sage leaf, sea salt

230
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then hopefully, it looks nice.

231
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] And we're going in.

234

235
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] So I'm doing them
at half an hour at 200 degrees.

236
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're gonna flip 'em round after
15 minutes so they get an even colour.

237
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're gonna go in

Oh, I hope they taste good.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I love that colour you get
around the edge and on the bottom.

248

you've actually surprised me there".

252
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're quite close to the final now.

253
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

so I can get a nice even colour.

265
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They needed longer in the oven.

302
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. I love that.

303
00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

304
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Flavour is superb. The apricot works
beautifully well with it.

305
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Lovely.
-The only issue is the bake.

306
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Too soggy. Needed another ten minutes
to make that flaky and beautiful.

307
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But your filling is exceptional.

308
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pop them in the oven for ten minutes,
have 'em for lunch.

309
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll switch it on now.

310
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Like the colour,
they do look all right with those seeds.

311
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They look good.

312
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Nice bit of flake there.
-[Prue] So it's prawns and pork?

313
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Paul] Hmm.

314
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It certainly tastes Chinese.

315
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, I'm not keen on the flavour.

316
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Not my favourite.
-Okay. Yeah.

317
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavours are delicious.
I'm not used to them in a sausage roll.

318
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Anything's allowed in pastry.

319
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But not a sausage roll.
-[Prue and Dan laughing]

320
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

321
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Thank you.

322
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, cheers, thank you. Nice one.
Win some, you lose some.

323
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can see a bit of lamination there.

324
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] But with a laminated dough,

325
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you expect that lamination to grow
so you don't end up with gaps.

326
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are very gappy.
It needed longer in the oven.

327
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Does it taste like Christmas?

328
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got the sharpness from the cranberry.
Bit dry, the sausage meat. Quite solid.

329
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is a tiny bit dry,
but I think the flavour is terrific.

330
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I like the texture.

331
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if the pastry was a little more baked,
it'd be perfect.

332
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thanks.
-Thanks.

333
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Happy with them?
-No, at home they got darker.

334
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] They do look pale.

335
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, got a bit of a soggy bottom there.
-Yeah. I'm so sorry.

336
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They smell good.

337
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They are a little underbaked.
-They are.

338
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I quite like the flavour. Flavour's good,
well-balanced, well-seasoned.

339
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pastry is your weak link.

340
00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It comes down to the baking.
-Yeah.

341
00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that that filling
is absolutely perfect.

342
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sharpness you get
from the cranberry is delicious.

343
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I agree about the pastry,
underbaked and too thick.

344
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the shape of them.
They're nice and round.

345
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Couple of things I like.
One, I like the colour.

346
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You got a nice, strong bake underneath.
But you see the layers here.

347
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The lamination.

348
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alison] Yeah.
-[Paul] That's a good sign.

349
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks.
-[Paul] They look very nice.

350
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh, nice crisp.

351
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nice bit of kick there from the chilli.
-Little bit of chilli flakes, yeah.

352
00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matty gasps]
-[Alison] Ah!

353
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you for bringing me a sausage roll.
-[laughs]

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] A very good sausage roll.
-Delicious.

355
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The onions really work,
the apple really works,

356
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-the chilli is great.
-[Prue] It's really good.

357
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, Matthew.

358
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

359
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That went well.

360
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I never thought about getting a handshake.
It kind of took me by surprise.

361
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm pretty happy with that.

362
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Happy with that. I fully expected worse.

363
00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew that they needed baking longer.

364
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bit of a mixed bag,
but you know, I've taken a few risks.

365
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

You'll all know this for sure.
It's a very, very famous bake.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul would love you to make
a chocolate caterpillar cake.

380
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

381
00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So your caterpillar should be made
of a chocolate Swiss roll sponge

382
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
filled with a chocolate
meringue buttercream

383
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then coated in a silky-smooth ganache.

384
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not forgetting the chocolate
and meringue features

385
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that will bring your caterpillar to life.

386
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You only have
two and a half hours for this.

387
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We were gonna give you three hours,

388
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but we didn't want your caterpillars
to metamorphosise into butterflies.

-Bake!

391
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A staple of any birthday in our house.
Yes, even my own.

392
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing] Never made one though.

393
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Had a few varieties from a few shops.

394
00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've got 16 steps.
There's a lot of components to this one.

395
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, Paul, the famous caterpillar cake.

396
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles] It's a terrific challenge.

397
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a Swiss roll sponge
which they've all done many times.

398
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The trick is getting the bake right.

399
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overbaking it by a minute,
it'll be bone dry.

400
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's important is to create the ridges.

401
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've explained how
and where to cut the strips,

402
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it creates these bumps
all the way along.

403
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Inside, they have
the Swiss meringue buttercream.

404
00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On top of that

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tasha] Okay,
this is not fiddly in the slightest.

511
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now we roll.

512
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just do a bit at a time.

513
00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matty] Not the prettiest of caterpillars.

514
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tasha] Go on, my son.

515
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah. Okay.

516
00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I might as well go
with what I've done now.

517
00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

518
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Try my best.

520
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Best thing I can do here is cut that off.
A very small caterpillar, isn't it?

521
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Got a swirl. I was expecting
a better shape. What will be, will be.

522
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think my cake might be a little bit dry,
but we'll move on.

523
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] Cover it in chocolate

524
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Splodge a bit more on, just in case, eh?

525
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

526
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

527
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not very long.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Cristy] That's done.

529
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Make a chocolate ganache to coat the cake.

530
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Heating the cream to the point
where it should melt the chocolate.

531
00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tasha] Gonna spread it
with my palette knife for control.

532
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] Fingers crossed
we are hiding a world of sin.

533
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Create features for the face."
Rosy cheeks may look nice. Ooh!

534
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] This'll be the best bit of the cake.

535
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is Noel. [laughs]
How big shall I make the sideburns?

537
00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-[Josh] It looks fairly cute.

540
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matty] Was supposed to be cuter.

541
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Cristy] Roll it up, still quite warm.

542
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Bakers, you have five minutes left.

543
00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] I can't wait for a pint.

544
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Cristy] Let it chill for a minute.

545
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a squirrel in this freezer.

546
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not funny. I don't know who did that.

547
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

549
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ganache, ganache, come on.

550
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

551
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

552
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] Not the children's party
I was hoping for.

553
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Tasha] That's terrifying.
-[Dan] And decorate.

554
00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Splodge 'em on everywhere, basically.

555
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

556
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

557
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

560
00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] I need to put the soil
around it now.

561
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-Move, move, move, move.
-[Cristy] Dan, can I use your crumbs?

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Paul] Moving on.

616
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit short on legs,
this caterpillar.

617
00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Very much so.

618
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-This is a very skinny caterpillar.
-[Paul] A small one. Look at those legs.

624
00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think the baker
understood about how to make the ridges.

625
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah, it's very, very small.

626
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At some kid's party,
they'd be a bit disappointed.

627
00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It seems to be all
Swiss meringue buttercream than sponge.

628
00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overmixed, overbaked,
either, either or both.

629
00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very good face.

In fifth spot we have… this one.

632
00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's me.
-[Paul] Dan, not quite sure what this is.

633
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I cut my things the wrong way.
Hence it's small.

634
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In fourth place we have this one. Josh.

635
00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tastes all right.

636
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But the cake's a bit tough.
-Okay.

637
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In third spot we have this one.

638
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Matty, the sponge was a little bit dry,

639
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you managed to get
all the elements there.

640
00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In second place we have this one.

641
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who's that?

642
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cristy, this tastes absolutely delicious,

643
00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it's a beautifully made sponge,
but it doesn't look great.

644
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had to remake it all,
and rush it, sorry.

645
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And in first spot we have this one.

646
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tasha, this is pretty good.

647
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have all the elements in place,
and it's beautifully round.

648
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's a decent cake, well done.
-Thank you.

649
00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Even if it does look like Noel.

650
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

651
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
First in technical.

652
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe I'll just base everything
on Noel's face from now on.

653
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] I knew I'd come last.
It's tough working at the front,

654
00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
can't see what everyone else is doing.
So you can't copy people.

655
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, it was an absolute nightmare.

656
00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Never wanna do it again,
but I can't believe it,

657
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so proud of myself.

658
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Party Week,
Matty's definitely bringing the party.

659
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He got a handshake,
those sausage rolls were off the scale.

660
00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] But he was third in technical,
he let himself down.

661
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Tasha, won the technical.

662
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously she cheated
by using my face on a caterpillar.

663
00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

665
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's between Matty and Tash,

666
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who at the moment
are in line for Star Baker.

667
00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:41.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That leaves Josh, Cristy
and Dan in trouble.

668
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I'm so surprised at Dan,
because Dan started off the Star Baker.

669
00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is there anything in the fact
that when you become Star Baker

670
00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then the following week you're rubbish?

671
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, darling, it's the curse of Star Baker.

672
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's well known.
-It's a real thing.

673
00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they win Star Baker,
next week I turn their ovens off.

676
00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's hope no one goes too hard too soon.

677
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, for your showstopper challenge,

682
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] We don't want beige.

684
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
my Auntie June's living room,
which is a hell of a beige room.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have a whopping four-and-a-half hours

690
00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

691
00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

695

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] Biggest challenge
is to get all the components made

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and give myself enough time to get
a nice decorative finish.

698
00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's like order of operations.

699
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Josh] There's a lot to do.
Decorating snowman time now.

919
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] Done. It's good 'cause the egg wash
makes them look a bit scaly.

920
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's pretty cool.

921
00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The lemon meringues are in the oven so I'm
just making the little toadstool toppers.

922
00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matty] Going in with the orange curd.

923
00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Conscious that they'll say it's a cupcake
and this is the quarter-final.

924
00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, it's a cupcake with curd.

925
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tasha] Choux didn't rise.
There's no air in it.

926
00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's as dense as a brick.

927
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All my elements are done.
Need to start rocking and rolling now.

928
00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Need to get a move on,
I need to brûlée them as well.

929
00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] I want to fill the choux buns now
which'll form Christmas puddings.

930
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes left.

931
00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales] Okay, that's going in.

932
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Cristy] Just covering
the back of the lollies.

933
00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit messy.

934
00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matty] They're gonna be tennis balls.

935
00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] This is just white chocolate.

936
00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] I'm putting a walnut on top
of the head, like an ankylosaurus armour

937
00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then just a couple of fondant horns.

938
00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] This is the hardest I've worked.
Biscuit Week, I had to do a fair bit.

939
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] I've never
worked harder to make food

940
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I probably never will do
once this chaos finishes.

941
00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tasha] My jam didn't set.
Tractor wheels will be rough. [sighs]

942
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have one minute left.

943
00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, bakers, your time is up.

946
00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] They don't look like
cricket balls, but I'm happy it's done.

947
00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It all looks a bit beige. I tried my best.

948
00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God, that was insane.

952
00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, I've got Swiss roll lollipop,

955
00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

956
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

they are pretty rough.

959
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tastes okay, but it's not baked enough.

960
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a pity, because I love the flavour.

961
00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

962
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

963
00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, okay, good.
-[Prue] So, those are the savoury ones?

966
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. This is lemon meringue.

967
00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

970
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's <i>Willy Wonka,</i> guys,

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Prue] Matty, I think that you've
achieved something quite clever.

985
00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

on every one of them.

986
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

988
00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They taste of crème brûlée
so you can have that.

989
00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no.

990
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Your oil's too hot.
-Okay.

991
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And because your oil's too hot,
it's a little raw inside.

992
00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavours are good.
The texture's not good.

993
00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Bit uneven, these.

994
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:12.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Lovely colour.

995
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-[Prue] That curd is so delicious.

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-Thank you.

1000
00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Then you have…
-[Matty] It's a chocolate orange cupcake.

1001
00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1003
00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It works well, a nice sharpness
coming from that orange,

1004
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
quite a moist sponge that as well.

1005
00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the flavour is absolutely perfect.

1021
00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, okay.

1022
00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm, that's quite disappointing.

1023
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Hmm.

1024
00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, underwhelming.

1025
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look at these pigs.

1026
00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice, er, structure inside.

1027
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pigs are lovely. I like the texture,

1028
00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the crust on them.

1029
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You are such a good bread maker.
-Thank you.

1030
00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Overall, a little underwhelmed.

1031
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And they are a bit beige,
which was banned.

1032
00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

1033
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dan, tell us about your showstopper.

1034
00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, this is my prehistoric buffet
with chicken curry dinosaur feet,

1035
00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
lemon biscuit fossils,
strawberry marshmallow ankylosaurus

1036
00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then some dinosaur eggs
with vanilla mousse.

1037
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I do like the theme.
Everything looks neat and tidy.

1038
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's ambitious. A lot of stuff going on.

1039
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Shall we try the feet.
-[Prue] Dinosaur feet.

1040
00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The curry is lovely.

1041
00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:44.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry is very crumbly
and actually delicious, but it's very dry.

1042
00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

1043
00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Love the flavour, love the idea.
-[Prue] Hmm.

1044
00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Erm, shall we try fossil,
erm, lemon biscuits?

1045
00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very nice biscuit. Erm, it is beige.

1046
00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Let's have a look
at these chocolate fellas.

1047
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The flavour's
overwhelmingly chocolate.

1048
00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You hardly get the middle,
because the chocolate's thick.

1049
00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is an authentic egg.

1050
00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] That's very good.
-Very clever. You did six things.

1051
00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:20.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps, if you'd done four things,
you could've got them perfect.

1052
00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Josh, tell us all about
your non-beige buffet.

1053
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have got some
Christmas wreath couronnes,

1054
00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then you've got choux buns
as my Christmas puddings

1055
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then the snowmen macarons.

1056
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're neat as a pin, they're uniform.

1057
00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Your little snowmen
are perfectly piped.

1058
00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're absolutely lovely.

1059
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The couronne look nice, even,
quite tricky to do so small.

1060
00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

1061
00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Delicious, actually, really soft,
it's well baked.

1062
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's got a crust to it
and soft in the middle.

1063
00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think they work in looks and flavour.
-They're delicious.

1064
00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] We've had the savoury.

1065
00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've got a caramel-like pastry
crème custard going through those.

1066
00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's absolutely delicious.

1067
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The vanilla level in there is lovely.
-[Prue] Very, very silky filling.

1068
00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] These are the coconut?

1069
00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, coconut and white chocolate ganache
and a jam right in the centre.

1070
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. Well, I love 'em.

1071
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Josh, I think you've done well.
It's hard to fault anything.

1072
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've done well with the flavours.
It's something I would go back for.

1073
00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-These are a triumph.
-[Prue] Aren't they?

1074
00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-These are particularly good.
-Thanks.

1075
00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Well done.
-[Josh] Thank you.

1076
00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was amazing, really chuffed.

1077
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My favourite comment
was Paul with the couronne.

1078
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To hear any comment like that
from Paul, king of bread, that's amazing.

1079
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will take that with me forever.

1080
00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:01.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd say this is the most positive
I've felt after any showstopper,

1081
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I'm pretty happy.

1082
00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I hadn't come first in the technical,
I would be really anxious right now.

1083
00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm pleased they liked all the flavours,

1084
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I'm just gonna focus on that.

1085
00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] General feeling is,

1086
00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I'm bouncing around
between third and fifth.

1087
00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could be any one
of three of us to be honest.

1088
00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How do you think
the showstopper went, Prue?

1089
00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who's gonna be reaching the semifinals?

1090
00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you look at that whole display,
they did get the idea of colour

1091
00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and some of the things were so delicious
and some were so disappointing.

1092
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's look at Cristy,
'cause those patties,

1093
00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you really liked those.

1094
00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The problem with Cristy's
is the way that it looks.

1095
00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not polished enough.

1096
00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought Josh did very well.
His couronne were delicious.

1097
00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, there's a couple of people
I think in line for Star Baker.

1098
00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think Matty is in line.
-Matty.

1099
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do think Josh is there.

1100
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What, for Star Baker, Josh?
-Yeah.

1101
00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But he had a particularly
bad day yesterday, didn't he?

1102
00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whereas, Matty got a handshake.

1103
00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Matty had a decent day yesterday.

1104
00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He could be one to watch.

1105
00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Josh had the good sense
to just do three things

1106
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and do them exquisitely.

1107
00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:10.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Whereas Dan on the other hand--
-Dan did everything.

1108
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Has he done enough to survive?

1109
00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cristy's another one that could go,
so it's between those two.

1110
00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's so sad, I can't believe
we've got to that stage

1111
00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-where two really good bakers are here.
-Two Star Bakers.

1112
00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gotta send a Star Baker home.

1113
00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I know.
-They've all been Star Baker.

1114
00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well done, bakers, you really
did bring the party to the tent.

1115
00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got the great job of announcing
this week's Star Baker.

1116
00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the Star Baker is…

1117
00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Matty.

1118
00:54:58.920 --> 00:54:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1119
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Unfortunately, I've got the horrible job

1120
00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of announcing
who's leaving the tent today.

1121
00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The baker needs to know
that when you get to this stage,

1122
00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
