00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

of a beautifully set baked custard

Do you know, a crème caramel is just cold
and it's gelatinous. It's gross.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's basically,
you get a beautiful caramel on the top,

69
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

When it's perfectly baked,
it will be just set.

72
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

73
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If it overbakes,

74
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it gets little holes in it
and becomes stodgy and rock hard.

75
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They can introduce flavour
into the caramel or custard,

76
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the caramel has to be the star.
You want it golden brown.

77
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you're not gonna taste it.

78
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you go to the black stage,
then it's gonna taste burnt.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Tasha] When I practised it, I overdid
the honey and it was rock-solid,

209
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I wanna get a balance.

210
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Tasha] I'm gonna use it all.
It's about two tablespoons.

213
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

214
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I went too slow with it,
so I'm gonna speed up the heat.

215
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

216
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you are halfway through.

217
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Cristy] This is the infused milk
for my custard.

218
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I'm just gonna pass it through a sieve
and bring that together with the eggs.

219
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Saku] Eight whole eggs.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. I'm very difficult

233
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I never answer my phone.
Spend two weeks to reply to a text.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

241
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] Caramel on the bottom,
custard on top.

242
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tasha] Gotta make sure
they're all the same amount.

243
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs to have
a little water bath around it.

244
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tasha] So, the hot water bath
stops the eggs from curdling.

245
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

246
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

247
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

248
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Cristy] At 140 for about
30 to 35 minutes.

249
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

250
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

260
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

These are my
Thai green curry-inspired crème caramels.

410
00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't say curry.
-[Dan] Okay.

411
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just Thai. Thai.
-Don't say curry.

412
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thai-inspired…
-It's bonkers.

413
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you got curry in there?
-No.

414
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-It's intriguing though, isn't it?

415
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's got the wobble, which I love.

416
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You're suffering
from a slight underbake.

417
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I am.
-[Paul] That one looks desperate, Dan.

418
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul and Dan laugh]

419
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I love that texture.

420
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's beautiful. It really is.
You've got your flavours spot on.

421
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The lemongrass makes that.

422
00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very nearly perfect.

423
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Doesn't look perfect
because they're collapsed.

424
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But that flavour is lovely.

425
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Great, thank you.
-You've invented a dessert, Dan.

426
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Thank you.

427
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The texture on the side is pretty bad.
I mean, it's bubbled up quite badly.

428
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that's because you left
them in the oven too long. Bit overcooked.

429
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] That's boiled inside.
-[Cristy] Gosh.

430
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At the moment, the orange is there,
but the caramel isn't.

431
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're too solid. That's the big issue.
-Okay. [sighing] Okay.

432
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] They look interesting.

433
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was worried about
you making caramel with honey.

434
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Could it have been thicker?
-[Tasha] Yeah.

435
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a swimming pool of sweetness.
It needs to be on the top, really.

436
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] That is a beautiful set.
Smooth as anything.

437
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The fig comes through,
the rosemary's barely there.

438
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the flavour,
it's lacking a little bit of direction.

439
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think using honey
was such a lovely idea.

440
00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But everything is too sweet.

441
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Thank you.

442
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're so pretty.
They're almost identical.

443
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And your jaggery seems to have worked.
It's nice and evenly shiny.

444
00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's very sweet, which I expected.
-[Saku] Yes.

445
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cardamom comes through beautifully,
but it's too thick.

446
00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] How many eggs?

447
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Eight.
-Eight whole eggs?

448
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Saku] Yeah.
-[Prue] That could be the problem.

449
00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You've got too much egg white.
-Okay. Yeah.

450
00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Straight off, they look very, very pretty
and there's a lot of finesse to this.

451
00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But there's a lot of bubbles
in there on the side.

452
00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're slightly overbaked.

453
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The spiced plum and the orange together,
the taste in that is delicious

454
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with the sweetness level just so.

455
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because the plums are not as cooked
as I'd expected and that's rather nice.

456
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They've got freshness of fresh fruit.

457
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just the texture's slightly off.

458
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is overbaked, but you can't
get over the flavour of that.

459
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Well done.

460
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They look attractive.
The caramel could've been a bit darker.

461
00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The colour's too pale.

462
00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-But they look nice and smooth.

463
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I love the flavour.
-[Paul] Hmm.

464
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because the chai flavour's quite strong,
it's interesting. It really works.

465
00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But they're probably a little overbaked.

466
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks like a frankfurter sausage.
You know, you get the skin--

467
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're not selling it. [laughs]
-[Noel] Enough.

468
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It tastes good, though.
-It tastes delicious.

469
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I keep wanting to go back
for another bite.

470
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Pau] Thanks.
-Thanks.

471
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'd eat a hotdog crème caramel.
-[laughs]

472
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matty] Went all right.

473
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When they was commenting
on the colour of the caramel,

474
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you don't know how lucky you are
to have any caramel. [laughs]

475
00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn't take a risk
unless it was worth taking.

476
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've created a dessert for myself.
I'm happy I pleased Paul, so… [laughs]

477
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I'm sad.

478
00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is not silky and smooth.
It is not good for me.

479
00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will be in danger.

480
00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Cristy] It was the bubbles.
The stupid bubbles.

481
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not gonna be
making 'em again. [laughs]

482
00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] <i>The bakers have no idea what</i>

483

Hello, bakers, welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your technical challenge.

484
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Today, it's been set for you
by Paul Hollywood.

485
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's wearing desert boots.
What you think are desert boots

486
00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
are actually dessert boots.
Made out of a thin layer of trifle.

487
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're new on the market.
Check those out.

488
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

489
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, Paul, have you got any
words of advice for our bakers?

490
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This recipe has got
three very distinctive textures.

491
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've gotta
get them all right for it to work.

492
00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison] Judges, you can leave.

493
00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No snacks. Remember,
leave some room for dessert, thank you.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul would love you to make six individual
orange and ginger treacle puddings.

496
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your steamed sponges
should be soft and light

497
00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and served with a smooth custard
and a ginger and orange syrup.

498
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got an hour and a half
which is plenty of time.

499
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your mark…

500
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake!

501
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know how to make this.
I am following the instructions.

502
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll get there.

503
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never made anything like this before.

504
00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it's gonna go real well. [laughs]

505
00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love a steamed pudding. It's a proper
rib-sticking pudding, isn't it?

506
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get it down you.

507
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul, this is one of my absolute
favourite puddings. [chuckles]

508
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A proper steamed sponge pudding.

509
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Yeah. This has got
a beautiful golden syrup on the top.

510
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Served with crème anglaise,

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then you have
the ginger and the orange syrup.

512
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go through the dangers.

513
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The killer thing with this is timing.
-Yeah, okay.

514
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They have to crack on with the syrup
that goes on top.

515
00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, we've allowed 20 minutes
with the syrup, getting it right.

516
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then they've gotta think of the sponge.
It's critical they get the bake right.

517
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Forty minutes minimum. Forty. Four-zero.

518
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now of an hour and a half, that doesn't
give you a lot of wriggle room.

519
00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-Who's gonna use their time wisely?

520
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Would you like to try one, Prue?
-Yes, please.

521
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then, you have this beautiful syrup.

522
00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That with the crème anglaise,
which is beautiful and silky smooth.

523
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The orange, the ginger,
it just blends beautiful together.

524
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's amazing
because the texture is both very moist

525
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and yet it's light.
-[Paul] Mmm.

526
00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul, this is heaven.
I'm looking forward to six more of them.

527
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs] And I'm going to have difficulty
not eating all of this.

528
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

529
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Some syrup. "Make the caramel."

530
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With 50 grams of caster sugar
and three tablespoons of water.

531
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, buzzing for that.

532
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cannot wait to make more caramel.
I'm mentally scarred. [laughs]

533
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] You know your way
around a treacle pudding.

534
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I do not.

535
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're too young.
-Yeah.

536
00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No one eats puddings any more.
-Not steamed ones.

537
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like something
from the Victorian era.

538
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

539
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She's nearly, nearly there.
-[Josh] Carefully pour the boiling water.

540
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Add some lemon wedge and stir
until the mixture comes to the boil.

541
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Simmer to produce a golden syrup.

542
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not golden. [sighs]

543
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This will go in the bottom of the sponge,
so I'm gonna get this bad boy syrupy.

544
00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This don't look right. It's stuck.

545
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I assume once it heats up,
it will melt, maybe?

546
00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] What's going down
in the Tash kitchen?

547
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

548
00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You do this every single time
you have a technical.

549
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I get a massive sigh. What's going on?

550
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't understand
why they've asked us to make a caramel,

551
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then add a load of boiling water.

552
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause it makes it all juicy
when it's in the sponge.

553
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

554
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Let's switch.
-[Alison] I'm assuming.

555
00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

557
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Butter's gone in, caster sugar's gone in,
eggs have just gone in.

558
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's do the stem ginger.

559
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Cristy] No one's gonna want
a big bit of stem ginger.

560
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chopping this like a nutter.

561
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Grated zest of an orange.

562
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I'll fold through my flour.

563
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] How's everyone making
their sponge? What am I doing wrong?

564
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, it's starting to mix in.
Is it or am I just fooling myself?

565
00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm fooling myself. It's all to the side.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

It's not very modern, is it?

567
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's from the era of Prue Leith.
-[Noel] It might be more Paul actually.

568
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs to be
a golden syrup kind of a texture.

576

614
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[exhales] I'm a bit stressed,

616
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

617
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

618
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

621
00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But not that thick.
It has to be pouring consistency, I think.

622
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

623
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

624
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

626
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

627
00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

631
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the thing.

632
00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

636
00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

637
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

641
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

642
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't know how I'm gonna tell

643
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

644
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Cristy] Think it needs longer.
I don't know, they seem soft.

647
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

648
00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the bain-marie is actually
slowing down the cooking.

649
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

719
00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

about how to make steamed puddings.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Flashbacks to being at school.
You know, when they're like…

746
00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they're worse than angry,
they are so disappointed.

747
00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you gotta laugh. [laughs]

749
00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dessert Week. It's been a rollercoaster.

750
00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the technical
was the worst thing I have ever judged.

751
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's up there. I was disappointed.
Judging that was quite difficult.

752
00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I guess we have
to ignore the technical.

753
00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The signature, they did okay.

754
00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now you look at Dan,

755
00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with that Thai influence there
with his flavours.

756
00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It worked, didn't it?
-It was odd, but it did.

757
00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And Matty did okay.

758
00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul and Prue] Josh did okay.

759
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think we've got a split.

760
00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The girls are in trouble
and the lads are safer.

761
00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm devastated.
-Even Tasha?

762
00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] She's middling, but Saku
and Cristy are in a worse position.

763
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gonna make
the showstopper exciting.

764
00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Some will come out fighting
and some will be demoralised.

765
00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did I roast them too much?
-No.

766
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-A little bit.

767
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison and Noel laughing]

768
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.

769
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And well done for getting
to the showstopper on Dessert Week

770
00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
without running away.

771
00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's certainly been no deserters yet,
has there, Noel?

772
00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, but it was touch-and-go yesterday.

773
00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison] It certainly was.

774
00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, for your showstopper challenge,

775
00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the judges would like you to make
a sharing-size dessert

776
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is encased within
a highly decorative meringue bombe.

777
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is a bombe with an "e".
I don't want any explosions in the tent.

778
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't want to be picking meringue
out of my barnet all day tomorrow.

779
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's very true.

780
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have four hours until we dispose
your bombes by yamming them down.

781
00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] On your marks…

782
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get set…
-Bake!

783
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:30.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the worst challenge yet.
My practice ones have not been successful.

784
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm pooing myself.

785
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Biggest challenge
is the meringue bombe itself.

786
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've done nine million meringues
this week, erm, and two worked.

787
00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lives up to its name of a bombe.

788
00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a high-risk one.
And potentially the last.

789
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What we're asking for is a meringue bombe.

790
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks like a sphere and inside it,
any kind of dessert they like.

791
00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The meringue itself
is probably going to be French meringue,

792
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because it's stable and it's strong.

793
00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So French meringue is essentially
whisked egg whites with sugar.

794
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And getting nice,
hopefully glossy stiff peaks.

795
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's what I'm hoping for.
-[Prue] We've asked for a bombe shape,

796
00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so we're testing them
on their meringue engineering skills.

797
00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The most obvious is to use a mould.
The bakers will do it in two halves.

798
00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a terrific danger
that they'll crack.

799
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is Dessert Week,
so we are expecting mousse,

800
00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
creams, crème diplomats, sponge,
chocolate, anything they wish.

801
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But they must taste
and work amazingly well together.

802
00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Saku] I am making
the choux buns first, vigorously.

803
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] First thing we're going for
is a génoise sponge.

804
00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once out the oven,
it frees up to be used for the meringue.

805
00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course, it's someone's last bake.

806
00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After the technical challenge,
we are expecting perfection.

807
00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can't have Mr Hollywood
disappointed again.

808
00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He gets very bad-tempered
when he's disappointed.

809
00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Hi, Matty.

810
00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Hello, Matty.
-Morning.

811
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tell us all about your meringue bombe.

812
00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I'm hoping to produce something
slightly better than yesterday.

813
00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Baked would be good.
-Something edible.

814
00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought I'll push the boat out,
do something a bit weird.

815
00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pistachio, strawberry and basil,

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're mostly liquid. You don't want
anything too wet touching the meringue.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're clever enough to put
their mixtures inside choux pastry,

1028
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1029
00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's danger of them collapsing.

1030
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite a difficult challenge.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1033
00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, okay then.

baking time will be enough.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Cristy] I think it's collapsing.

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1060
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Step away from your showstoppers.

1064
00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, so glad it's done though.

1072
00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really tough gig, that.

1073
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was revolting. [laughs]

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I must say, the piping is excellent

1078
00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:05.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the idea is original

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1081
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1085
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if Wimbledon did strawberries and cream

1086
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it's a slightly acidic flavour.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Idea of a bombe is you eat
a bit of the meringue as well.

The bombe itself is nice.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I say bit, it's a lot messy.

1105
00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Somehow, the pistachio flavour
is too rich and heavy.

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Prue] The meringue is very good.
I think this outside is a little triumph.

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:15.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the whole thing

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You struggled with the base
'cause you've got several pieces…

1118
00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

It's just…
[laughs] Now it's blasted, yeah.

1120
00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not much of a bombe though.

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Saku] The dark chocolate,
it is pistachio and Irish cream,

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and with the white chocolate,
it's passion fruit curd.

1124
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The choux buns don't look good.
They're a bit flat.

a bit more on flavour.

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overall, I think you created a nice shape.
There's a nice dome to that.

1134
00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Going to have a quick look inside.

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, okay. There you go.

1137
00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's very clever.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:25.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, it is a trifle with, erm,
chocolate génoise sponge,

1139
00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:30.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and a raspberry jelly sphere

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you got a sharpness
to the jelly in the middle.

1143
00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sponge on the outside is delicious.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:42.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you created a lovely trifle
in the centre of the Earth.

1146
00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. What's wrong with that?
Nothing. Well done.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you're not ever going to expect me
not to like the look of that.

1151
00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Prue] Can I say something,
a bombe is nice if it's round.

1153
00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Cristy] You know what,
we move them away now.

1154
00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And I think
it's more impressive like that.

1155
00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Looks like the bombe's gone off.

1157
00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's actually profiteroles,
not a croquembouche.

1158
00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And they're filled
with a crème diplomat with berry coulis.

1159
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-There's too much icing, too sweet.
-[Cristy] Okay.

1160
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I love the filling.
It's nice and sharp.

1161
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've let yourself down a lot
with that interior.

1162
00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like the middle wasn't important.
Just chucked something in.

1163
00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But from the outside,
it's fantastic.

1164
00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sometimes, you do get pretty things
who are ugly on the inside.

1165
00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Oh, no.

1166
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was tough.

1167
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't think I've done enough to stay in.

1168
00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Being on the cusp
of getting into the quarter-finals,

1169
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would be disappointed.

1170
00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It went better
than I could have hoped for,

1171
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I've had the biggest smile on my face.

1172
00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] I was really pleased with that.

1173
00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That went really, really well, didn't it?

1174
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My meringue cracked,

1175
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they didn't get the flavour
from the profiteroles.

1176
00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are in danger. [laughs]

1177
00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, were you blown away by the bombes?

1178
00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Were they the comeback kids
after their technical?

1179
00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Josh was my comeback kid.

1180
00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That strawberry cake was beautiful.

1181
00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was. Nice to see Dan come back again.

1182
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

and you saw layers on layers…

1184
00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Both those guys
are in line for Star Baker.

1185
00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cristy and Saku,
one of those two will be going home.

1186
00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Saku, she had no base at all.

1187
00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was literally like a cloche
over half a dozen choux buns.

1188
00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn't have minded that.
The problem with Saku has been

1189
00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-not enough oomph in her flavours.
-[Paul] Yes.

1190
00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:55.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where did Cristy go wrong
'cause it looked incredible?

1191
00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Looks can be deceiving.
-[Alison] True.

1192
00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Style above substance,
'cause it wasn't very nice inside.

1193
00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1196
00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got the amazing job
of announcing Star Baker.

1197
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

who is leaving us this week is…

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
