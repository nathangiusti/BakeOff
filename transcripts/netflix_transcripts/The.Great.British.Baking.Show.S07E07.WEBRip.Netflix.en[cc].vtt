is the hot cross bun at Easter.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they could have spice in there,
or other flavours.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's just honey, maple syrup,
brown sugar, cardamom for the glaze.

though, as well, don't we?

248

249
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

253
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hmm. There's a couple

but I'll call it a saltire,

263
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

267
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michael] They've cracked
a wee bit on the top.

268
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think mine might have been
a little bit underproved.

269
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] Hide them.
Hide them at the bottom.

I've ever done.

272
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just gonna give them
another 49 seconds.

273
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michael] I feel like I want to go in
and get them.

274
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] They look baked.

275
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I'm gonna take 'em out.

276
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
About that sort of colour
is what I'm aiming for.

277
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. [exhales sharply]

278
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] I've tried to keep them
away from each other,

279
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but some of them have stuck,

280
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'll just put the bad ones
in the middle.

281
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're a bit messy, but they'll do.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Bakers, you've only got
five minutes left.

283
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Five, four... Oh, it's...

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, I'm gonna glaze in the tin

286
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause we've not got time
to do anything else.

287
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The glaze, hopefully,
will give a bit of a kick,

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could-- Couple of minutes less, perhaps.
It's just gone a little bit dark there.

303
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] Hmm.

304
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I don't think they're bad
at all. The shapes are amazing.

305
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] They look really good, I think.

306
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nice texture, though.
It's, erm, springy, soft cake.

307
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Hmm.

308
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I love the flavour of saffron,
it's really good with the sugar on top.

309
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That's a well-baked dough.

310
00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The structure's good,
the flavour is fantastic.

311
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It just needs that...
a few extra little bits of fruit in there.

312
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very good, though. I'm impressed.
-Well done.

313
00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] They are a bit uneven,
aren't they?

314
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

315
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] They will be slightly misshapen

316
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because of the volume of fruit
in there as well,

317
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because you get one with more fruit in it,

318
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it can't grow as much as one that has got
less fruit in. Let's have a look.

319
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But they're lovely and shiny.
I like the glaze.

320
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, the glaze looks good.
Decoration's nice.

321
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a little tough, actually.

322
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I think your flavour is spot-on.

323
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The spices are nicely warming
and balance with the fruit.

324
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, that's good.
-[Paul] It's very good.

325
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It does taste like figgy pudding.
It's really delicious.

326
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I do think they look very shiny
and very attractive,

327
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and my mouth's watering.

328
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They smell amazing,
don't they?

329
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look.

330
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The fruit distribution's in there actually
and we didn't see it down the middle,

331
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you can actually see it properly
in two halves,

332
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when you cut it down the middle.

333
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The texture's perfect.
-[Prue] The texture's lovely.

334
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, and they're sticky, you know,
you can feel it on the fingers.

335
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's not too much spice
and it's not too little.

336
00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Hmm.

337
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done. Well done, Steph.
-Well done, Steph.

338
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They're nice
hot cross buns, them.

339
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Well done, Steph.
-[Noel] Yes, well played.

340
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think they all look
similar to each other.

341
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a bit more
of a difference in the colours.

342
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] Hmm.

343
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Even side to side.

344
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Wow. Well, you've got
your blueberries in the middle.

345
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Yeah.

346
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Nice texture.
Did you candy the lemon peel?

347
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] Yes. Took me quite a while.

348
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Yeah, it needed a bit more.

349
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Quite bitter, isn't it?
The lemon in there.

350
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sweetness hasn't come out in it.

351
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I also think the lemon curd glaze

352
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is not as attractive
because it's not shiny enough.

353
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

354
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think you baked them well,

355
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just think there's a pretty
irregular colour going on in there.

356
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Alice] Hmm.
-[Paul] And size.

357
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, they look homemade.

358
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>[Prue] They're lovely colour.</i>

359
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They look great.
Highly decorative.

360
00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, they'd look great
in a shop window, those.

361
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The buns themselves look a bit flattish.

362
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can see they're sitting quite squat.

363
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've got pretty consistent
on the colour.

364
00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:18.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And there's a bit of raspberry jam.

365
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] They're a nice flavour.
I'm...

366
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I look at that crumb...
-[Rosie] Hmm?

367
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, this is where you've dug it out
and you've put this in.

368
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Rosie] Yeah.
-See how quite, er,

369
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
dense it is down there? Open?

370
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did have to do it when it was quite hot,

371
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I was sort of cutting them and then
pressing down with the fork when it was...

372
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it... Yeah, it's condensed the...

373
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Rosie] ...a bit hot, yeah.
-...dough down at the bottom.

374
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's really pleasant.

375
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like, erm, sort of almost
doughnut texture, it's nice.

376
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think you've done
a great job.

377
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think they do look very, very smart.
Thank you very much indeed, Rosie.

381
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so happy you put that back on.

382
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've got a pretty stable colour,
you know,

383
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you have irregularities there in the size.

384
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Little bit, yeah.

385
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

388
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

are good.

391
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Paul] Yeah, my only gripe
is the, erm, the size difference.

394
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Prue] I don't think
you say "shut up" to the judge.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Right, bakers, welcome back.

412
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Time for your Technical Challenge.
Today it's been set for you by Paul.

413
00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Any words of advice?

414
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is about the perfect textures
both inside and out.

415
00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thank you for that. Off you pop.
What are they up to today?

416
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're going to Paul's soft play area.

417
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, it's a funny thing to call it.

418
00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The judges would like you
to make 12 Sicilian cassatelle.

419
00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Er, so cassatelle
are typically served at <i>carnevale</i>,

420
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is, of course,
the Italian word for, erm...

421
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Slippers?
-No. Ca-- Carnival. Yeah.

422
00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, yeah.
-[Sandi] Yeah, okay.

423
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your cassatelle are pastry crescents
filled with a smooth and creamy ricotta,

424
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
flavoured with chocolate and orange,
and fried until crispy and golden.

425
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They need to be uniform in shape and size.

426
00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Perfect for the <i>carnevale.</i>
-[Sandi] Hmm.

427
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-[Noel] You've got an hour and 15.

-On your marks...
-Get set...

429
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake!

[David exclaims]

431
00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cassatelle?

432
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I've never had these before.

433
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cassatelle. There we go.

434
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not even the foggiest clue what it is.

435
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] It's what looks like
a pasta machine.

436
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] I guess, almost like ravioli,

437
00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but, like, fried and sweet.

438
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe, I don't know.

439
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cassatelle, basically they're Sicilian
snacks that you'd have at a carnival.

440
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, inside these beautiful pastries,
we've got ricotta,

441
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we've got chocolate
and we've got orange in there as well.

442
00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where the hard bit is,
is getting the pastry nice and thin,

443
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and overall filling this properly
with the ricotta.

444
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause these look very well-filled
and well-sealed.

445
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] And the other problem
they're gonna have,

446
00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is obviously you've gotta fry it.

447
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they don't roll their pastry
and it's a bit thick,

448
00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-...as soon as it hits the oil,

449
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
chances are it's gonna burst open,

450
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-the ricotta will pour out into the oil.
-Hmm.

451
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay, would you like to try, then, Prue?
-Yeah.

452
00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] So, you can see from the inside,

453
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-it's full of filling.
-Hmm.

454
00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't wanna crack into one
and have big air holes in there.

455
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It must have that ricotta chocolate
all the way through.

456
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No grittiness, nice and orangey.
That is delicious. [chuckles]

457
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great with a cup of tea.

458
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was thinking it'd be great
with a glass of marsala.

459
00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You would, though, wouldn't you?

460
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Deep fat fryer to 170.

461
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is scaring me,

462
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because last time I had to
deal with one of those,

463
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had this weird thing,

464
00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'm just trying to make this
a better memory.

465
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, "For the dough,
make a stiff, pliable dough."

466
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know what kind of dough
it is that I'm making,

467
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the ingredients don't help with it.

468
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] Maybe it's more like pasta dough,

469
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which I've never made before, so...
[chuckles]

470
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michael] I'm just gonna kind of
bung it all in a bowl

471
00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in some sort of order,
and see what happens.

472
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn't say how much water. I've put
a couple of tablespoons in so far.

473
00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] Stiff, pliable. What does it mean?

474
00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not crumbly, bit of stretch?

475
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think this is quite pliable now.

476
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michael] So, knead until smooth.

477
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] Yes.

478
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michael] <i>Then divide the dough into four.</i>

479
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that is chilling in the fridge.

480
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need to sieve the strained ricotta
until smooth, and make the filling.

481
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] This just takes me back
to dairy week.

482
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] What are you doing?

483
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm trying to get rid of liquid
out of some cheese.

484
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What does it look like I'm doing?
[chuckles]

485
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah, of course. Ricotta, right?

486
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ricotta. Look at that, yeah.
-Yes.

487
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you tell what I'm doing
without looking at a sheet of paper?

488
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sicilian cassatelle.

489
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And what's that?

490
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't know.
-No. [laughs]

491
00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wasn't listening

492
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when Sandi was explaining to you
what they are. [laughs]

493
00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's-- A lot of the liquid's now gone,
which is good.

494
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In my head, it was just going...

495
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>La, la la, la la la la</i>

496
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gonna sieve it. Never sieved ricotta.

497
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ricotta has quite a cheesy,
grainy kind of texture, doesn't it?

498
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, it might take a couple of sievings.

499
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No one ever thought,
"I need to sieve some cheese."

500
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice sighs] This is the weirdest thing
I've ever done.

501
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it meant to do that?

502
00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rosie] I've put it through
the sieve twice,

503
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it better feel smooth now.

504
00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] So I'm just gonna
make the filling.

505
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Got my sieved ricotta,
then some orange zest,

506
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Fairly uniform, and sealed.

655
00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Paul] Let's have a look
at the filling on this.

657
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

658
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

660
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it looks lovely, tastes lovely,

661
00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

662
00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] But they're a nice shape,
and they're actually well fried as well.

663
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I like the crimping, but...

665
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

666
00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That filling is so delicious. [chuckling]

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got a bit of crispiness
to the shell as well.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

671
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, moving on.
These haven't been sealed properly.

673
00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

674
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

676
00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can see the big air pocket there.

677
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is very thick, as well,
on the pastry.

678
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

679
00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, moving on,
similar problem again, not sealed.

680
00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A couple have opened up.

681
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not much filling in there either,
it's all pastry.

682
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The thinner the pastry, they would've
found it easier to seal as well.

683
00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, these are all over-fried,

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

685
00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're not actually uniform,
they're not all the same shape.

686
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Solid. Yeah, you can tell straightaway

687
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
how thick that is.

688
00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's been cooked all the way through,
but they've had to leave it in there

689
00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause the pastry's so thick.

690
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And this one looks pretty good,
it's nice and light.

692
00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:43.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Hmm.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Same problem.
-[Paul] They've burst again.

694
00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But they are quite neat,
so it doesn't look too bad.

695
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

697
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, decent amount of filling.
It's a nice thin pastry as well.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've had a bit of a run of fifth.
Fifth, fifth, fifth, fifth, fifth, fifth,

720
00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and yay, first. So yeah, super happy.

721
00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Second, again. Steph asked me,
she was like, "I think you've got first."

722
00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was like, "No, I repel first.
I think I've got second."

723
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I knew I hadn't done very well. I'm not
particularly confident on tomorrow.

724
00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tomorrow's Showstopper is by far
the hardest challenge

725
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we've had to do in seven weeks.

726
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not a great end to the day.

727
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn't take a genius to work out
that I'm kind of sitting at the bottom,

728
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so tomorrow, it's gonna be
important that I do well.

729
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michael] Oh, it's warm already
in here, isn't it?

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, yesterday, I think I detected a change
of atmosphere in the tent for the better.

734

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Almost.

736
00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can I just say Henry, though,
in his Signature?

737
00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

742
00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I thought it was so sweet.

743
00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought the Signature was very good,

744
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but to get it done properly,
and it proved it in the Technical,

745
00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to get it done properly
is quite difficult.

746
00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because of that Technical, we've got Alice
and Michael down surely at the bottom.

747
00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Alice took a bit of a gamble and tried to
do too much almost, and then it...

748
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The benches that are clean
means in their head they're organised...

750
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hers is generally a crime scene.

751
00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Yeah.
[Noel] And David, he has

752
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

everything up.

753
00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
David is so good at it.
He keeps everything neat as a pin.

754
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know, but he is neat as a pin.

Hello, bakers. Welcome back to the tent.
It's time for your Showstopper Challenge.

759
00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Today the judges would like to see
your take on kek lapis Sarawak.

760
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, so this is a colourful cake
which originates from

761
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the Sarawak region of Malaysia.

762
00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's often used
in religious and cultural celebrations.

763
00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your cake should display even
and precise layers, and be grilled?

764
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] Grilled.
-Grilled?

765
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

766
00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When your cake is cut and reassembled,

767
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it should form intricate patterns
that run through it.

768
00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got 4 hours and 15 minutes
to do that.

769
00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That doesn't sound long enough.
-[Sandi] No. On your marks.

770
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Get set.

771
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] Bake!
-Or grill.

772
00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:27.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd heard of Malaysia before.
I hadn't heard of Sarawak or kek or lapis.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they took it across to Sarawak in
Malaysia where they added all the colour.

775

The Showstopper this week
is a complicated one.

778
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've asked the bakers to do
a Sarawak-style layer cake.

779
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>They have many, many layers</i>

781
00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:55.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They put a thin layer of batter
in a cake tin, grill it for a few minutes,

782
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
take it out, more batter, grill it,

783

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

It's very difficult to do.

786
00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

like this before.

787
00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

so that it's still very thin.

954
00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't wanna wreck any more layers

955
00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

969
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and therefore depth.

970
00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not raw. It's not raw.

1028
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1029
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Definitely more rubbery than I was hoping.

This is my little cutting guide.
My dad made it.

1039
00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I told him the measurements
in a bit of a panic,

1040
00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

so my dad made me one,

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1064
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I forgot to put lime curd on it

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1105
00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

1108
00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it just hasn't been executed

1113
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

what you've actually done

1114
00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause there's a lot of work there.

1115
00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a shame you didn't add
a little bit more colour

1116
00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because that bottom layer there
looks quite raw, rubbery.

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I drizzled rum between the layers,
so it has got a bit of moisture in it.

1120
00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are layers,
but because they're all the same colour,

1121
00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1123
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is a little stodgy.

1124
00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very claggy, very stodgy in the mouth.

1125
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the soaking
was probably a bad idea.

It's almost like all one now,

1127
00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a very dense piece.

1128
00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, when you eat it, it's a bit rubbery.

1129
00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overall, it looks wonderful.
It's just a pity about the texture.

1130
00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1131
00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks, Michael.
-Thank you, Michael.

1132
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all right, it's fine.

1133
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:34.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's this?

1134
00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Henry] Just cake.
-[Paul] Another cake.

1135
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry] There's a lot of cake there.

1136
00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's all cake. Yeah.
-[Prue] It's all cake.

1137
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I think that's really clever.

1138
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks like a stack of egg sandwiches
in an afternoon tea.

1139
00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:44.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what I was going for, yeah.

1140
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Is that what you were going for?

1141
00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Shut up.
-[all laughing]

1142
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Henry, I think that is
a really nice textured cake.

1143
00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not stodgy,

1144
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the lemon and lime comes through,

1145
00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's really nice.

1146
00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Actually, I'm quite impressed.

1147
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's not perfect.
-No.

1148
00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's been executed pretty well,

1149
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and actually, you do get a nice flavour

1150
00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in the mouth and nice texture,
certainly not rubbery.

1151
00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It breaks apart like a cake would.

1152
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even though it's cut
into so many different pieces.

1153
00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I actually think you've done
a pretty good job.

1154
00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I'll tell you, my first impression

1155
00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is that it's architecturally
very interesting,

1156
00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I love the shape of it
and everything else.

1157
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My next is that it is very small.

1158
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, this was
supposed to be for a party,

1159
00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a big cake for a lot of people.

1160
00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is this for Sandi's family?
-[all laughing]

1161
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sylvanians still have to eat, you know.

1162
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's meant to be more,
but I had an issue with some of my layers.

1163
00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I lost quite a bit.

1164
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The lines that
you've managed to achieve

1165
00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the colour definitions that
you've got here are pretty good.

1166
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice and spicy.

1167
00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Think it could be a bit sweeter, really.

1168
00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's a little bit rubbery.

1169
00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's perfectly edible
if you had a piece like this.

1170
00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You couldn't eat much more than that,

1171
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I quite like the flavour
and I love the neatness of it.

1172
00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's very neat.

1173
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Just think the whole thing
is not quite sweet enough.

1174
00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you eat a tiny little bit of icing
with it, it's great.

1175
00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's extremely neat.

1176
00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The detail in it is incredible.

1177
00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The way you've gone to all this trouble
to get this pattern going,

1178
00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then the lines on the top
are beautiful.

1179
00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The painting, the decorations
of the fireworks look good.

1180
00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:56.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It looks a bit dry,
and that's my only concern at the moment.

1181
00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The layers are so thin

1182
00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:01.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they're so small,
your little blocks or strips,

1183
00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that it almost looks like weaving.

1184
00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is pretty clever, isn't it?

1185
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That is very, very good.

1186
00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is there almond in there as well?
-[Alice] Yeah.

1187
00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Tastes like marzipan.
-[Prue] Mmm.

1188
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That works really well.

1189
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The marzipan gives it that petit four...

1190
00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
almost texture, flavour in your mouth.

1191
00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the detail in there
is exceptional.

1192
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fine, vibrant, and very artistic.

1193
00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Very good.
-[Prue] I think it really works.

1194
00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Thank you very much.

1195
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Well done.

1196
00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Phew.

1197
00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, you never know.

1198
00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did lose Technical,
my buns weren't amazing,

1199
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I think I might just
have saved myself.

1200
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I got Star Baker, it would be nice
'cause that's the final, like,

1201
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
tick list of being here.

1202
00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, it'd be a lovely
little bonus to get that.

1203
00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul did tell me to shut up, though.
He got me back.

1204
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause I told him to shut up
in the Signature, so... fair play.

1205
00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Michael] I was going to say
I got a grilling,

1206
00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I tried to hold that one in.

1207
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did all right in the Signature,
just wasn't as good.

1208
00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Didn't do well in the Technical, surprise.

1209
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:09.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then I've done okay in the Showstopper
but now okay isn't enough.

1210
00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Myself, Alice, Michael and Rosie
have all had positives and negatives.

1211
00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anyone could go. I could go this week.

1212
00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's really, really close, I think.

1213
00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Well, that was pretty good.
-I thought it was fantastic.

1214
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Rosie's was a bit messy.

1215
00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think she's put herself down
into a spot of trouble.

1216
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She was so ambitious, I mean

1217
00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the way she cut her cakes was
much more complicated and difficult

1218
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and she didn't succeed.

1219
00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a pity.

1220
00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought Michael's was quite neat,

1221
00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you weren't
as impressed with it, were you?

1222
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Michael's chief problem was
there were lots of layers in that

1223
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they all run together
'cause they're squished, aren't they?

1224
00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just blends in with the marzipan,
doesn't it?

1225
00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, I think point in question is,
when you look at David's,

1226
00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
look how neat that is.

1227
00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a shame they're very small
and they were a bit rubbery.

1228
00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I liked the decoration with cake on cake
that Henry did.

1229
00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
-[Prue] Oh, I loved it.

1230
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The taste of Henry's was very good.

1231
00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You get that lime and lemon,
perfect combination.

1232
00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The colours balanced up
beautifully as well.

1233
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As was Steph's, I mean she had a problem
with the filler on that one

1234
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but you can see every single line,

1235
00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
every single colour in there as well.

1236
00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Alice has done a great job
on this challenge, actually.

1237
00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause now she was in terrible trouble
coming in to the Showstopper.

1238
00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Yeah.
-[Prue] Oh, she must have saved herself

1239
00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
surely, that was such a good cake.

1240
00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who might be in line for Star Baker?

1241
00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me, I think Rosie and Mike
are in a little bit of trouble.

1242
00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I think Alice has saved herself.

1243
00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:35.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I think any one
of the other three could be Star Baker

1244
00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and that includes Henry, Steph,
possibly David.

1245
00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello, bakers. I’ve got the fantastic job

1246
00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of announcing who's won Star Baker.

1247
00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:03.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the person who's won Star Baker
this week is...

1248
00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Henry.

1249
00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[clapping]
-[David laughs] Well done.

1250
00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shut up.

1251
00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1252
00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:25.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, this leaves me with the horrible job,
and it gets so hard now.

1253
00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m afraid the person
who is leaving us is...

1254
00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Michael.

1255
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I’m so sorry.
-It's okay. It's okay.

1256
00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was my time, it's okay. It’s okay.

1257
00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michael] I feel okay.

1258
00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My head is held high and I am so happy
and so proud... and so tired. [laughs]

1259
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m going out laughing,
and that’s brilliant.

1260
00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:01.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s totally fine.
Don’t worry. Don’t worry.

1261
00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wish I was a pretty crier

1262
00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you know, like in black-and-white
French films when it’s raining.

1263
00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But instead, I’m like... crying ‘cause
I couldn’t make a kek lapis Sarawak.

1264
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It’s pretty sad, Michael going.

1265
00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He did okay, but overall,
the standard this week has got better,

1266
00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I think from now on in,

1267
00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we’re gonna see
a different standard of baking.

1268
00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Henry] That went well.

1269
00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s my tick list now.

1270
00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t actually need to do any more.

1271
00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've ticked everything off.

1272
00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Alice has made me cry now.

1273
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Michael] Oh, no.

1274
00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m just gutted, erm,
that Michael’s left, yeah.

1275
00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He’s just been so supportive,

1276
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t think I’d have got this far,
to be honest, without Michael.

1277
00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I’m so glad to be going through.</i>
<i>I can’t quite believe it.</i>

1278
00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it’s gonna
take a while to sink in,

1279
00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
kind of week eight of the Bake Off. What?
