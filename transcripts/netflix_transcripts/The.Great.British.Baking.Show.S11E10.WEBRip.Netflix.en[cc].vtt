208
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] This lie is the biggest burden

209
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
especially when I tell
my children, "Never lie."

210
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Obviously, this is a slight exception.

211
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My eldest wanders into the kitchen.
He doesn't question anything.

212
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

213
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm like, "I'm making

214
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's like, "Cool."
Wanders off with his iPad.

215
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He just thinks I'm absolutely crackers.

216
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's been very difficult keeping it quiet
and not telling the world

219
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

220
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so proud of him.

221
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

222
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Pat] He was a whirlwind.

223
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was cheeky, he was mischievous as well.

224
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The trophies that he's won

226
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It never got to his head
that he was man of the match

227
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

228
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's very critical of himself.

229
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wanna make sure I put my kids in bed,

232
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Soon as eight o'clock strikes,
it's in here until I'm done, basically.

233
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

234
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

240
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think he can.

241
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

246
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then I'll turn my attention

247
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to the wonderful boy that he is.

249
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

316
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This just hopefully
completely dries them out.

317
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll pipe the first hole,
then I go for the second,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

341
00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Hi, Josh.

353
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like the look of them.
They're all pretty much the same size.

354
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pretty uniform across the board.

355
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That's perfectly filled.

356
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm always so cross

357
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavours are very delicate.

358
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But they are absolutely delicious.

359
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think, for me,
it's a little bit too sweet.

360
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-[Paul] It almost needs a sharpness

361
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to make that pop even more.

362
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

363
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

364
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Chocolate's the right level,
it gives a lovely texture to it.

365
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The craquelin on the top.

366
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Coffee level is absolutely spot on,
filled well, baked well.

367
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

368
00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

373
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you're gonna put cherry on top,
make sure it's all the same.

374
00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

375
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm.

376
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the flavour of the banana.

377
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're missing the caramel.

378
00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know you tried to get it on the outside.

379
00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But for banana lovers, this is perfect.

380
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Now that's the first one
we've had that is properly firm.

381
00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:25.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the Black Forest gateau.
You could've done more cherry.

382
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Matty] Okay.
-The chocolate is lovely. Booze is good.

383
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And most of all,
I like the crisp, firm éclair.

384
00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

385
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These look a bit messy.

386
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's the wrong shape for this.
-[Dan] All right.

387
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Can't have something
that's too big that sits over the top

388
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-shadowing underneath.
-[Dan] Right, okay. Got ya.

389
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've attempted too much.
They do look very soggy.

390
00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour is lovely, not too sweet.

391
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's really strawberries and cream,
but it's soggy.

392
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've destroyed it
by adding too much cream.

393
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On top. Yeah.

394
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] This is the praline, isn't it?

395
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not convinced about the flavour.

396
00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you not?
-It's probably the grain.

397
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I agree that the filling
is not satin-smooth,

398
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I think the flavour's great.

399
00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it looks a mess.

400
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sucks teeth] Paul picked up
on all my technical issues.

401
00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And again I've been guilty
of overthinking it.

402
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would not have been able to produce
anything like that. So… yeah.

404
00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And hopefully it isn't just,
"Step one, make this," and that's it.

408
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and today it's been set for you
by Mr Paul Hollywood.

412
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What can we say about Paul?

413
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've heard his poetry,
we've seen his dance moves,

414
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we've seen him strip down to trunks
and wrestle a live bear.

415
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure you've fallen in love with him
and he loves you too.

416
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Although, he will destroy you one by one.

417
00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul, have you got any words of advice
for our incredible finalists?

418
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For perfection,
you're going to need patience.

419
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] This technical challenge
will be judged blind,

420
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so we're gonna have to ask
these two to leave the tent.

421
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the last technical challenge,
you know where they're going.

422
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Where?
-To make sweet, sweet love.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For your final technical challenge,

425
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul would like you to bake
a batch of nine lardy cake slices.

426
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now the judges will be looking
for perfectly laminated dough

427
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
packed with soaked fruit
and homemade candied peel.

428
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have three hours.

429
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks…
-Get set…

430
00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake!

431

432
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look at ya.

433
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A lardy cake?

434
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] I've heard the name,
but don't know what one looks like.

435
00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No one makes lardy cake, do they?

436
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-Not since the war.

437
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It sounds like
one from that era, doesn't it?

438
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do you not know what a lardy cake is?
-No.

439
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, dear.

440
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a lovely nostalgic bake for a final.

441
00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lardy cake.

442
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've revisited a British classic.
It's been around for hundreds of years,

443
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it was a way of using up
predominantly pig fat.

444
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But don't forget fat is flavour.
-Yeah.

445
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I'm really flavoursome.

446
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

447
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's a cross
between a Danish pastry and a bread.

448
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is all about
getting your timing right.

449
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get the dough done quickly

450
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to get it in that prover,
and then you're layering it with sugar…

451
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Folding it.
-…lard, butter and fruit.

452
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On the second prove, be patient.

453
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The longer the better.

454
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That opens the whole thing up,

455
00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it'll condense
if they don't bake it properly,

456
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it'll look and taste quite raw.

457
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] You can see the layers. Lovely.

458
00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you can see
all the fruit in there evenly distributed.

459
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lard, sugar and a bit of fruit.

460
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] Heaven.

462
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then grease with lard
and sprinkle with sugar."

463
00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I assume this is gonna help
colour up the lardy cakes.

464
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, you are
the oldest of the bakers.

465
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I am, yes.
-So you must know what a lardy cake is.

then add yeast and water.

471
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll add a little bit at a time.

472
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

once it comes together,

473
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll put the lard in.

474
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know.

475
00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

if I should be doing it like this.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

477
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Matty, lamination is really bad.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Number two, we have this one.

Dan, stayed in the oven
a bit too long, didn't it?

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

we have this one, Josh.

626
00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's decent, right colour
and certainly the right flavour.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Dan] Josh has probably
got his nose in front,

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and me and Matty
are scrapping at the bottom.

633
00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

634
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm glad I had a good signature,
'cause otherwise I'd be a bit deflated.

-Very quiet walk this time.
-Yeah, very quiet. In the zone.

638
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, guys, we've made it to the final.

639
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just hope the sunshine comes out.

641
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who's bringing the sunshine right now?

642
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are they even at the moment?
-It's pretty even.

643
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Josh has got a slight edge.

644
00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] He is slightly ahead.

645
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Weirdly, Matty is sitting
in second place, I would say.

646
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If he wins it, he would've played
an absolute blinder,

647
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause he's always just
underneath the top.

648
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] Can we talk
a little bit about Dan?

649
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He'll struggle against the other two
at the moment,

650
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but what often happens in the final bake
is the pressure gets to them.

651
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Any one of 'em could win.

652
00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

654
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Great. So, I've just put
20,000 pounds on Amos to win.

655
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-It's good odds.

656
00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I bet.

657
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, it's your final ever
showstopper challenge.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and elevate it into something incredible,

662
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
something that could win
the entire competition.

663
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have four and a half hours for this.

664
00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

666
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, Dan. Flour power is needed.

667
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's lots of elements to do,
so timing is what I'm most worried about.

668
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just know how I want it to look.

669
00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will spend the time to make it
and that will be my downfall.

670
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They have to make
a minimum three-tier cake

671
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to celebrate their very first bake.

672
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But we're looking
for that to be the inspiration

673
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
for something completely new
and different and wonderful.

674
00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We want it highly decorated,

675
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we want tartness,
we want sweetness, we want textures.

676
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the biggest bake
they will ever do.

677
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it was me,
I'm a big fan of the lemon drizzle.

678
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That would be my favourite.

679
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But sometimes, the bakers tell us
that this is going to be a lemon cake

680
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it doesn't have enough lemon flavour.

681
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to deliver what you say
you're going to deliver.

682
00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My first footstep into baking
was a lemon drizzle cake.

683
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A lemon meringue pie as well,
so my three-tiered cake today

684
00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

absolute beauties of the baking world.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then brownie.

827
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a little gander.

828
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd say them two are done.

829
00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know,
but I haven't got that much time left.

830
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Whose stupid idea was this?

831
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the last lot of panels.
Beautiful, right.

832
00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[oven beeps]
-That can go off now.

833
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] I'm inserting dowels.

834
00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I need to put the dowels in,
actually, as well.

835
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] White chocolate buttercream.
We need to get going with cake.

836
00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matty] And then freezer.

837
00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Josh] That's the first one done.
-[Dan] Right, come on.

838
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Forty minutes.

839
00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matty] Bit of summer fruit jam.

840
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] I just need to get it in the fridge
for as long as it takes.

841
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:17.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nearly there.

842
00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Right, macarons.

843
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Done the middle layer with strawberry
and rhubarb jam. Doing the final layer.

844
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just swapping the tiers.
So how long do we have left?

845
00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you only have half an hour left.

846
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I'm happy with that. Right.

847
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, you're joking me. These should just
basically peel off perfectly.

848
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, you stupid thing.

849
00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. It's cracking.

850
00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Matty] Let's see how much I learnt
from Lara's art lesson.

851
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] Look a bit underdone actually.
Too soft.

852
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just don't think I probably
made the batter well enough.

853
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But deal with it. I need to
collect my thoughts for a second.

854
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Number two.

855
00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lara said you have
to build up the colour.

856
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Be patient and always go
in the same direction.

857
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You okay?
-No.

858
00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] You need it all to go smoothly.

859
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Dan] Yeah.
-[Noel] Dig deep.

860
00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You can do this.
-I can do it.

861
00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] Where did you
get this design from?

862
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's kind of like, 'cause I'm not good
at doing it any other way.

863
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, but it works though,
it looks really arty.

864
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] This is going to be
spring at the top.

865
00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why did I choose to temper chocolate?
It's gonna look very rushed, this.

866
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:27.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have 15 minutes left.

867
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Josh] Come on.

868
00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Don't swear, Dan.

869
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're getting to the critical point,
where I need to stack it.

870
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't want it to lean.

871
00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Dog's dinner.

872
00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] Want to put the greenhouse on,
then I can finish.

873
00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Any time I've got spare,
I'll do some decoration.

874
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] How's long's left?

875
00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looking good, bakers,
you have ten minutes left.

876
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Josh] I'm gonna have to rush
a lot of decoration.

877
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] Need a blowtorch.
Don't know why I'm even bothering.

878
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Matty] Gold leaf out of it.

879
00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are my giant marrows
that I harvest in the autumn.

880
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll hide it with a macaron,
Paul and Prue will never notice.

881
00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wanna do some piping
round the outside of it

882
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to make it look a little bit fancier.

883
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How long we got left now?

884
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One minute left.

885
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] It's messy, too messy.

886
00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't look behind ya and look at Josh's.

887
00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, your time is now up.

888
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Walk away rapidly. [chuckles]

889
00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alison] Please step away
from your bakes. We love you.

890
00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

891
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on, bring it in, mate, bring it in.
Well done, boys.

892
00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Goodbye, Paul.
-[Josh] Got buttercream over your back.

893
00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Don't worry about it.

894
00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, no. My mistake.
You got four minutes left.

895
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I'm back at the tent. It's so exciting.

902
00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Abbi] We've got a group chat
where we all talk,

904
00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
post pictures of what we've been doing,

In my mind, I think Dan's going to win,
but I think it's gonna be so close.

908
00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're all incredible,
all good at different things.

909
00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I literally can't call it.
If I had to say someone, maybe Josh.

910
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:11.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Either Dan or Josh or Matty.

911
00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One of those.

912
00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Matty could surprise everyone.

913
00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's probably like asking a parent
to pick their favourite child,

914
00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's a very difficult call, Josh.

915
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dan, for one last time,
bring up your showstopper.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, this is my lemon drizzle
and meringue cake

918
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with a lemon curd and raspberry compote,

919
00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
topped with Italian meringue
and decorated with some macarons

920
00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
filled with the lemon curd
and raspberry compote.

921
00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the white chocolate against
the raspberry, I like the meringue.

922
00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The macarons are terrible.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Dunno what's gone on with 'em.
-I wouldn't put them on.

924
00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Dan] Yeah.
-[Paul] 'Cause it sort of ruins it.

925
00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did think it was quite ambitious
to do three chocolate collars.

926
00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yeah.

927
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-You know, it needs more lemon.
-Does it?

930
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The drizzle only comes in to so far

931
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and then it stops so…
-Ah, okay.

932
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the flavour is delicious
and I think the bake is lovely as well.

933
00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Macarons let it down dramatically.
-Yeah.

934
00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And the bake's not right.
-[Dan] I don't know what's gone on.

935
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's really pasty.

936
00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have I not cooked them
for long enough?

937
00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] No, you definitely haven't.

938
00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, I've not, have I?
-No.

939
00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just a little bit flawed for me.

940
00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Work to be done for next week.

941
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

942
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks, buddy.
-[Dan] Thanks very much.

943
00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Matty, would you like to bring up
your showstopper please?

944
00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Matty, tell us about your showstopper.

945
00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The top and bottom tier
are inspired by a chocolate cake.

946
00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, it's a chocolate genoise sponge
with a French chocolate buttercream

947
00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and chocolate brownie
coated in a Swiss meringue buttercream.

948
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Middle tier is a Victoria sponge,

949
00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so it's lemon and rosemary
with summer fruit jam

950
00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a American buttercream.

951
00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's leaning a bit. Did you put--
-Dramatic effect.

952
00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles]
-[Paul] What happened?

953
00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mustn't have done
much of a job with the dowels.

954
00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I must say, Matty,
I love the colour combinations.

955
00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the way you've done it.

956
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the decoration,
the piping, the fruit,

957
00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-the drop is the big problem.
-Yeah, it's done me.

958
00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] But let's see
what's it's like inside.

959
00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, that's one light sponge.

960
00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs] Oh. Wow.
-[Prue] That looks beautiful, doesn't it?

961
00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I'm surprised
it weighs enough to cause the lean.

962
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] What a great cake.
-Thanks.

963
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Now the chocolate's coming in,
it's a light chocolatey, moreish sponge.

964
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's absolutely delicious.
-Hmm.

965
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have no good reason to having
another bite, but I've got to.

966
00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I love the jam.
-I like the cake.

967
00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It reminds me of some of the nice
birthday cakes I had when I was a kid.

968
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a beautiful sponge.

969
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] All the flavours are perfect.
-Thank you.

970
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really perfect, Matty.

971
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's nothing wrong
with this cake except it's on the lean.

972
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's such a pity,
because it's only one mistake.

973
00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Prue] Everything else

974
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is absolutely perfect.

975
00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Matty] Thank you.

976
00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done, Matty lad. Awesome, mate.
-Thank you.

977
00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good luck, mate.

978
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you need a hand
getting it off the table?

979
00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I'll be okay. We'll see.

980
00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Josh, it's time for your showstopper.

981
00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Josh, tell us all about
your final showstopper.

982
00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've called this showstopper
"A Slice For All Seasons."

983
00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all representing the seasons
in the garden.

984
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's inspired by a Victoria sandwich,

985
00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so the bottom tier
is an apple and lemon sponge

986
00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with a lemon curd
and a white chocolate buttercream.

987
00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The top two tiers are the same.

988
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're an apple and vanilla sponge
with a strawberry and rhubarb jam

989
00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and a white chocolate buttercream
in as well.

990
00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got a Swiss meringue buttercream
on the outside.

991
00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And my biscuit greenhouse on top.

992
00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the greenhouse is great
and the colours are beautiful.

993
00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It is straight and it is level.

994
00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pipework is not very neat.

995
00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could've spent
another half hour on that

996
00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to create a much more polished image.

997
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you want to keep this intact
or can I taste the biscuit?

998
00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can taste.
There's some strawberry in the biscuit

999
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and they're mints used for the panels.

1000
00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[crunching]

1001
00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very clever that.

1002
00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a sugar biscuit, isn't it?

1003
00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Bound together with some--

1004
00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Really minty, isn't it?
-Hmm, it is minty.

1005
00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, I really like that.

1006
00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue chuckles]

1007
00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Let's look
and see if we can try this spring.

1008
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm. Jam is perfect.

1009
00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like the sponge.

1010
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not getting any apple.
It hasn't showed up to the party.

1011
00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, you can't taste the apple.
-No.

1012
00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've gone with the rhubarb
and strawberry.

1013
00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It needs something more.

1014
00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

1015
00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This one's got a little compressed
with the weight of the others.

1016
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Josh] Yeah.
-[Paul] Hmm.

1017
00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Mmm.

1018
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely lemon curd.

1019
00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The lemon curd's nice. Got a nice flavour.

1020
00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you need
another layer of lemon curd.

1021
00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I question whether
that sponge is overbaked.

1022
00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think your flavours are adequate,

1023
00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and for me, I wanted to see much more
of your journey in the tent in that cake.

1024
00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:07.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think boring is too strong a word,
but it's on its way.

1025
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not your best shot.

1026
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks, Josh.

1027
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thanks, Josh.
-Thank you.

1028
00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was being a bit harsher

1029
00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I've set my own standards
on my showstoppers…

1030
00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[hesitates] …and I know the finesse
wasn't probably quite there as I'd like.

1031
00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know who's gonna win.

1032
00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it might be between
me and Matty. Maybe.

1033
00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, hopefully I've done enough
with yesterday as well. Maybe.

[exhales heavily] I've got absolutely
no idea to be--

1035
00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Honestly, I don't feel like
I'm gonna win it.

1036
00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's between them two, personally.

1037
00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Blimey.

1038
00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That could be enough.

That's it,
we've done the last showstopper.

1045
00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pretty good cake.

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] You are always
telling Dan to simplify.

1048
00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Today he definitely did simplify,
but he didn't get all the elements right.

1049
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But with Josh,
you've never told him to simplify,

1050
00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and usually his showstoppers are,
they're a bit more clever.

1051
00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think that the decoration
was defined enough,

1052
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it wasn't up to his usual standards.

1053
00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But he's still in line for winning
because he had a good day yesterday.

1054
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alison] He did.

00:51:54.880 --> 00:52:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I think Matty has also pushed himself
into that possibility of winning as well.

1056
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because of what he's done today
and because of his flavours.

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The only thing wrong with Matty's…

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:11.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

In the signature, they were very close.

1060
00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I'm really pleased with that.
