You sure this canal goes
all the way from Berkshire to Venice?

19
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. It's one of Britain's
best-kept secrets.

20
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh! A bit like the fact that we're doing
the first ever Italian week.

23
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Valley of the Cakes, I think.

25
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs] Hopefully they won't
get rid of me this week either.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Star baker last week
was, yeah, it was sick.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But literally, I enjoyed it for one day.</i>
<i>I got to crack on with Italian week now.</i>

28
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, Italian week.
It's like boot camp for bakers.

29
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] <i>I absolutely love Italy.</i>

30
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hopefully, by the end
of the weekend I still will.

31
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Morning bakers,
or should I say <i>buongiorno,</i> bakers.

32
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am so excited about Italian week,
I have designed my own Italian shirt.

33
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Italian Stallion.

34
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pony.

35
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] More of a pony, right.

36
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, Prue and Paul would like you to make

37
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
your version
of the Sicilian classic, cannoli,

38
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so those little fried pastry tubes.

39
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, apparently, every
self-respecting Sicilian mother

40
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and even one or two with no respect at all
as her own version of this recipe.

41
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] The judges would like you
to make 18

42
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with three different flavoured fillings.

43
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, your tubes must be identical.
Nobody wants mismatched tubes.

44
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, that is painful.

45
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have got two and a half hours.
On your marks...

46
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get set...

47
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both] <i>Infornare!</i>

48
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Ciao, bellissimo.</i> Isn't that Italian?
[imitating Italian accent] I don't know.

49
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The one thing I have learnt is that
you respect Italian food and Italians.

50
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Sicilian cannoli is a tube
of deep-fried pastry

51
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
filled with a ricotta sweet mixture.

52
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just to make it a little harder,

53
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we have told them they
have to have three different fillings.

54
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The most difficult thing about making
a cannoli is getting the shell right.

55
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It must be beautiful golden brown</i>

56
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it must have bubbles
when you are frying it.

57
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is very characteristic of a cannoli.

58
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] <i>The luscious filling,</i>
<i>it mustn't run out.</i>

59
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should be able to eat it
in your hand without a mess.

60
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] <i>All right, it's very hot today,</i>

61
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and we are asking the bakers</i>
<i>to make cannoli.</i>

62
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But they make them in Palermo
in the middle of summer

63
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that can be 45 degrees. No excuses.

64
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I am just making my dough
for my 18 cannolis.

65
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] We are gonna add vinegar.
Quite an unusual ingredient.

66
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Yan] So, this is the science bit.

67
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Vinegar evaporates quickly
and creates bubbles.

68
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] <i>Getting the balance right...</i>

69
00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] 160 grams.

70
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>...is crucial to achieving</i>
<i>the perfect cannoli shell.</i>

71
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] Don't want to put too much in.
Don't want it to be a sticky mess.

72
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Good morning, Liam.
-[Prue] Hi, Liam.

73
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hello.
-Right, tell us all about your cannoli.

74
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, my cannolis are inspired by me,
basically, how I am as a person.

75
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[all laughing]
-I love that. It's a narcissistic cannoli.

76
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, my mates say that I have
a cheesy sort of sense of humour,

77
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'm going for
a lemon cheesecake cannoli.

78
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then I eat a lot of Turkish food
in my spare time

79
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so my second one is,
like, inspired by baklava.

80
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Liam's third filling</i>
<i>is marshmallow and chocolate.</i>

My dad took me camping
a couple of years ago.

84
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Camping always reminds me of, like,
marshmallows and, you know, chocolate.

85
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the idea of the flavours.
Have you been practising?

86
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, 100%. I don't know how many cannolis
I have been through this week but...

87
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Don't you believe me?

89
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One egg. Plus, yolk.

92
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

94
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the flavour and the smell.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They do produce some incredible food
and that's why we love it.

Hello, Stacey. What are you doing?
What's your cannoli?

102
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have a jam roly cannoli.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was jam roly-poly cannoli
but I took out the "poly".

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I decided to do a new twist.

108
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

when your cannoli shells are cooked

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

brown, aren't they?

110
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

128
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had one once, an espresso Martini,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

all my jewellery to strangers.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

137
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you get the tell-tale bubbles
on your cannoli?

138
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

140
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when it turns the correct colour
to take them out,

141
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I'm relying on instinct.

142
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, I'm just making the base
for all 18 cannoli across three flavours.

143
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] The thickener,
that is the most important thing.

144
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hopefully, my filling will be nice
and tough and not fall out of the tube.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Liam] And when I add the ricotta--
It's the ricotta-based one.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

they would probably get quite angry.

151
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just didn't want a crowd of angry
Italians saying that's not traditional.

152
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

167
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ah...
-[Sandi] It's quite nice, isn't it?

201
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Today the tent is hotter than Palermo.

202
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And they are deep frying, poor things.

203
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] <i>It's about to get even hotter.</i>

204
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exclaims]

205
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] 'Cause what you want to do
in this heat is put more clothes on.

206
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't want to burn myself.

207
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Yan] Health and safety first.

208
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we are splashed with hot oil,
it's gonna really, really hurt.

209
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's do this.

210
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In you go.

211
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] This bit is the most
important bit.

212
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just hope they don't separate.

213
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Seal the edges.

214
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't seal them,
just comes straight off the form

215
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and floats to the top like a poppadom.

216
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great, it's poppadom week.

217
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why did that just ping off the mould?
I'm not impressed. Oh, God!

218
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Some of them are just floating up.

219
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, so that is one minute, 15.
That's not enough.

220
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh.

221
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Yan] I can't tell when it's done.

222
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What I do find fascinating is Stacey
and Yan are adding

223
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a little bit of cocoa powder
to the mixture. It's quite dark.

224
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] How will they know when it's fried?

225
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I tell when I'm deep frying
something by the colour.

226
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Are you all right?

227
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Yan] Oh, dear. That's not good,

228
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and this is what
it's not supposed to look like.

229
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was a shame because
that was a good-looking one.

230
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not the day, is it?

231
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. Yeah, this is-- I totally want
to do this on a really hot day.

232
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you want me to somehow block the sun?

233
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you could that would be great.

234
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna put a call in to the moon.

235
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Yan] Thank you, my darling.
-See you in a bit.

236
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] They're making bubbles.

237
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We want the bubbles
on the surface of the dough.

238
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stacey] Bubbles are really important.

239
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Some of them haven't got
as many bubbles as I would like

240
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I'm gonna do those ones again.

241
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I really don't want
to run out of time.

242
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] Right. Fillings, that's mashed-up
almond praline.

243
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] Chocolate espresso one is underway.

244
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] Lemon cheesecake.

245
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have 15 minutes.

246
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] You see, these are better.
I've got 15 minutes,

247
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I'm not gonna have time
to fill them if I don't get on.

248
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's weird, it's not as thick
as it is normally.

249
00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:35.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As soon as it hits the really hot weather
here it's getting quite liquid already.

250
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] Oh, my God!
It's all coming out the sides.

251
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[gasps] This is a disaster.
Absolute disaster.

252
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales] Stop shaking.

253
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] I think I'm one short.
I have lost a shell.

254
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have just ten minutes.

255
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps] Under pressure, immense pressure.

256
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Hi, Stacey. I'm coming in
but only briefly,

257
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and I'm moving.
-Okay.

258
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Stacey] Okay. I'm going out.
-I'll come in, you go out.

259
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

260
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
His little tube's fallen off.
What am I doing?

261
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, man.

262
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] You have got one-minute, bakers.

263
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sixty seconds to make it count,
you can do it, come on.

264
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stacey] Can't believe what I've done.

265
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The raspberries are supposed
to go at the end of these

266
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I've only gone and put them
on the other ones, haven't I?

267
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] I'm so upset.

268
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Liam] My hands always shake when it comes
to, like, the last couple of minutes.

269
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, time's up.

270
00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate sighs] It's too hot.

271
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stacey] They look a mess.

272
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

273
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>The bakers' cannoli now face</i>
<i>the judgement of Paul and Prue.</i>

274
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hi, Stacey.
-Hi.

275
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Erm, is that not meant to be
like that, then?

276
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] No. Well, no,
and I'll tell you why.

277
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's basically happened is,
I've put the raspberries

278
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
on the end of the wrong ones.
I have dipped them in the wrong thing.

279
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's formed bubbles. It has got
some bubbles on there. Tiramisu?

280
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stacey] Yeah.

281
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great flavours, tiramisu.

282
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] That cheesecake one
is absolutely beautiful,

283
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the pastry, it's a bit doughy.

284
00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a raspberry one.

285
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A bit chewy. It shouldn't be chewy.
It's underdone.

286
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The pastry dough started off brown,

287
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's very difficult to tell

288
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-looking at it when they're fried enough.
-[Stacey] Yeah.

289
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] When you were holding that one

290
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I couldn't tell what was fingers
and what was cannoli.

291
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you should rename
them "Hollywood Fingers".

292
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think-- Do you know what?
I might do. Little stumps.

293
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Great shell.

294
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Really beautiful bubbles.

295
00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Okay, let's look at this
marshmallow chocolate.

296
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, okay.

297
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Pouring out, isn't it?
-[Liam] Yeah.

298
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Probably not
the best choice for filling.

299
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Hmm. The lemony one is delicious.
Very good.

300
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's this one again?

301
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Liam] Pistachios, walnuts, ricotta.

302
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] You can really taste
all of that. Sensational.

Cheers.

304
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Look at the bubbles
on that. It's perfect.

305
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have milk chocolate,
honey and almond praline.

306
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:53.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I love the flavour.

307
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the praline in there,
particularly, is very good.

308
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Steven, that mocha one
is very unctuous, lovely.

309
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] This is Italian lemon curd.

310
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] Very sharp.

311
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm, it is sharp.

312
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The flavour of that with
the Italian lemons is delicious.

313
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's so sharp. Well done.

314
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] My biggest concern is
I don't see too many bubbles on them.

315
00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:28.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Some look quite flat
without too much activation.

316
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry itself is very, very thin.
Remind us of this one?

317
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Yan] Mint, lime and rose.

318
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nice bit of tartness.
The flavours in that are lovely.

319
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Yan] Honey and Amaretto.

320
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel laughs]
-I don't think that's meant to happen.

321
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bartender is always ready for you.

322
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Your pastry is too tender

323
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I didn't squish that hard.
It just fell to pieces.

324
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cocoa has fooled you
into thinking it's ready.

325
00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It probably could have done
with a little bit longer,

326
00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just think your shells
have let you down.

327
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] They're certainly not
quite identical, are they?

328
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, some of them are a bit shorter,
some of them are more bubbly.

329
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got quite a few bubbles on some of them.

330
00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the Martini one, is that right?

331
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] Yeah, espresso. Yeah.

332
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Not very alcoholic.

333
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am a little disappointed.
I thought there would be more.

334
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] This one?
-[Kate] Limoncello.

335
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think the alcohol is all right.

336
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Kate] This is the negroni.
-[Prue] They are very orange-y.

337
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The ricotta in that one
particularly, you can taste,

338
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-which is delicious.
-Thank you.

339
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] So, I have a lemon,
lime and ginger.

340
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
An Amaretto and almond
and a hazelnut and chocolate.

341
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've tried it with ricotta,
I just prefer the mascarpone.

342
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Right. It's gonna be fascinating
to try it with the mascarpone.

343
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's gonna be interesting to see
how this set in the shell itself.

344
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a real test.

345
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

346
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It doesn't pour all down you. It holds.

347
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, very good.

348
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is not at all sloppy.
I think you might have converted me.

349
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Awesome, thank you.

350
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:27.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The almond and Amaretto,
mmm! That is heaven.

351
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You got that slight dryness coming
through in the flavouring as well.

352
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I think you got three
very good cannolis there.

353
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] If cannoli on the streets of Sicily
tasted like these, I'd be very happy.

354
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not sure I'd be welcome
after my use of mascarpone though.

355
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] I think you should take that in

356
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

spray tan for the colour.

357
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you should take that one in.

358
00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much indeed.

359
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-[Paul] Thank you.

360
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] I was a little bit concerned,

361
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but that went a lot better
than I thought it was going to.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know that feeling, you know,
when you eat something really sharp,

364
00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it gets you right here.

365
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You cannot afford even to mess up
a little bit here now.

366
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

383
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't actually know what pizza is.
I'm joking, I'm joking.

384
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Yan] Basically, it's bread
with a bit of cheese on top.

385
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

386
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] So, Prue, why have you chosen
a pizza Margherita

387
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as the technical challenge?

388
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Well, it's one of those things
that everybody thinks is easy,

389
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and actually it's quite difficult
to get right.

390
00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The dough, it's got to stretch because you
want it to be really, really thin.

391
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have you left them with rolling pins?

392
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. We took their rolling pins away.

393
00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thought they might fling it up
and get it round.

394
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bit of throwing, press of fingers,
bit of throwing...

395
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the traditional way to do it.

396
00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got the classic Italian flag,
the white, the red and the green.

397
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a sacred thing,
a pizza Margherita to the Italians.

398
00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It really is important if you are going to
use basil to put it on at the end.

399
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tastes better raw.

than they think.

533
00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

539
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's definitely time to come out.

540
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not gonna overcook this baby.

541
00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Be nice if it was a bit more rounded.

542
00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've just taken some of the basil off,

543
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause it doesn't really look very nice
when it's been cooked.

544
00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, that's the end
of your technical challenge.

545
00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bring your pizzas up
and stick 'em behind your photo.

546
00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Be proud.

547
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] Can I put mine in the bin?

548
00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolute disaster.

549

[Noel] <i>Paul and Prue want to see</i>

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] We will start with this one
over here.

552
00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cooked on the bottom
and nice and soft in the middle.

553
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the end of the slice
to just tip over a bit.

554
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It did.

555
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm, it's got a beautiful flavour.

556
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] And the dough is well-flavoured.

557
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah, yeah.
-Bread is well flavoured.

558
00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Yeah, it's a nice pizza.
-Okay, very good.

559
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think that pizza,
it is actually a little thick.

560
00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is sort of a little bit
more like an English pizza,

561
00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
rather than an Italian pizza.

562
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] A little bit of tang,

563
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
nice tomato coming through
at the end. Not bad at all.

564
00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] So, this one, bit of a disaster.

565
00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think mainly because the baker

566
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
put the topping on the pizza
before putting it onto the peel.

567
00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's very thick,
because it's concertinaed up.

568
00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:09.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Hmm.

569
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Raw dough is not particularly nice to eat.

570
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] This one, I think
that the mozzarella

571
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
has been cut up too finely.

572
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] When you chop up
little bits of mozzarella

573
00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you sort of lose it in the passata.

574
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The whole thing is white, green, red,
the Italian flag.

575
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look.

576
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's too thick. It's underseasoned.

577
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just not very exciting to eat.

578
00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:33.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Right, this one.

579
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not absolutely perfectly round
but it looks really good.

580
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I like the basil on there as well,
the nice green basil.

581
00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I love the fact
that the edges charred a bit.

582
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flavours are there, the tomato's good.

583
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] And it's lovely and thin.

584
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Okay, moving on to another one

585
00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which looks like it's got stuck
on the peel again.

586
00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's massively underbaked.

587
00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is definitely undercooked.

588
00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But overall, you could eat most of them.

589
00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>Paul and Prue must now rank</i>

590
00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In 6th place is this one.

592
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, you got it stuck on the peel,
I take it.

593
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:12.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

594
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Noel] So, for the technical challenge
it seemed quite simple.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pizza, it's a classic Italian dish,
but it's actually quite tricky.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a couple of weeks of really struggling.

is that Liam's pizza was good.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was vying with Steven for the top spot.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You might get a saucepan in the face,
or you might get a hug.

637
00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

So for your showstopper <i>Italiano,</i>
the judges would like you to make

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
shell-shaped filled pastries

643
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As I am sure you know,
sfogliatelle means "thin leaf",

644
00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so once baked, your delicate,
multi-layered pastries

645
00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
should resemble crunchy rustling leaves.

646
00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The judges would like you to make
a batch of 24 perfectly flaky pastries.

647
00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the filling is up to you.

648
00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have four and a half hours.
On your marks...

649
00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

652
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
50 grams of sugar.
I know this recipe off by heart.

653
00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need to do really well today,
otherwise I'm in danger of going home.

654
00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quarter final, it's like my absolute goal.

655
00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sfogliatelle, it was developed
about 200 years ago in Italy by a nun.

656
00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It's layered, a bit like a filo pastry.</i>

657
00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's akin to a lobster tail.

658
00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you bite into it,
it cracks in your mouth.

659
00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Inside has to be
the most luscious filling.

660
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>We've asked the bakers to make</i>

662
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The biggest mistake
they could do with this

663
00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

664
00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they don't, they'll all just fall
to pieces in their hands.

665
00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is so, so delicate,

666
00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
even I struggled when I was in Italy
making it myself.

667
00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think this challenge is pure murder.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's just leave it to the professionals,

671
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or six insane bakers in a hot tent.

Right, my Sicilian lemons.

673
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Paul] I love the idea of the flavours.

677
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This challenge, what did you think
is the trickiest bit of it?

678
00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's getting that, that flair of leaves.

679
00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I was sort of researching
Italian chefs that were making these,

680
00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they were saying, "A, don't bother",
or "B, it's three days".

681
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Four and a half hours is all you've got.

682
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's just very complicated

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

736
00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

748
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I'm gonna present 24 sfogliatelle
whether it...

818
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It might well kill me,

819
00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they never said you had to be alive
to take the judgement.

820
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I'll wear your apron.
Anything I could do to help?

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To be honest with you,
you are the least of my problems.

827
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are sitting on an ice bath
just to stop it

828
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Such a wind-up merchant.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

843
00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

845
00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just gonna stick these in the freezer
for a sec because they've melted.

You don't want to get that from Prue.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anyone for a canapé?

848
00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you imagine if you got
that in the shop?

849
00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You would be like, "How much?

850
00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not paying for that."

851
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's just get this pain over

852
00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] I'm gonna put these
in for 15, 20 minutes.

853
00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] As the fat cooks it will
just push all the layers apart.

854
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, little babies, laminate.

855
00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all about when it goes
in the oven, how it looks.

856
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

857
00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Time? Not doing great because I've got

858
00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
16 minutes to put them
in the oven for half an hour.

859
00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the reality of this situation

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

861
00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, no lamination.
I'm gonna get screwed over.

864
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think "no lamination"
is the end of the world.

865
00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I'm not laminated
and I'm having a great time.

866
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can't look at it, they freak me out.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have ten minutes. [speaking Italian]

869

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have you got enough time to bake them?

871
00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
God, no.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

876
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

877
00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My choux puffed too much
'cause the whole thing has gone, ergh.

878
00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very depressing

-[Noel] What do you want bigger?

-[Noel] Different colour?
-[Kate] Don't they? Let's be honest.

882
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just everything but what they are.

883
00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, the filling does taste great,
I haven't got it in yet.

884
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's just see if I can get it in without
it all spilling out.

885
00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely ludicrous. It's melting.

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on. Come on.

889
00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At least yours are cooked.

890
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

891
00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry cream
is leaking out everywhere.

892
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shooting out of every orifice.

893
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is weather-related.

894
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that's a bit of a problem for me

895
00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the only reason why I did
the choux pastry in the first place

896
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
was to put the lovely crème pat inside,

897
00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so it's gone from disaster
to disaster to disaster.

898
00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

899
00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

900
00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hope you drop them.

901
00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All else fails put on some icing sugar.

The last Italian challenge.
We can all have a nice espresso Martini.

the heat, it's not my fault.

your sfogliatelle?

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rum soaked raisins, orange zest.

924
00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The orange comes
through in that one, actually.

925
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Flavour's lovely.

926
00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:21.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know that took hours
and it's a hell of an achievement.

927
00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Steven, please bring up your sfogliatelle.

928
00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Proper showstopper.

929
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Lobster tail, excellent lamination.

930
00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Style.

931
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, substance.

932
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Style box, ticked.

933
00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:57.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And substance.

934
00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue laughing]
-[Steven grunts]

935
00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chocolate, the little bit of heat
that comes from the ginger is delicious.

936
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Sicilian lemons
taste really Italian.

937
00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:11.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It goes on flaking in your mouth
because the pastry is so perfect.

938
00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:14.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] What you have done is sfogliatelle
which are authentic.

939
00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you could sell them
in any pastry shop in Italy.

940
00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Thank you.

941
00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Great lamination.

942
00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:32.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got that classic lobster tail
running all the way through.

943
00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The time that you've spent on it,
you can see the intricacy.

944
00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So this is the cherry?

945
00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sophie] Yeah.

946
00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

947
00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's got a nice bitterness to it,

948
00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which I think works inside.

949
00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that's like crisp leaves.

950
00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Chewing it you get
the passion fruit and mango.

951
00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is quite a showstopper.

952
00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I must say I'm a bit disappointed,
not only in the way they look,

953
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the sfogliatelle,

954
00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but also because this was supposed to be
a showstopper presentation,

955
00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it doesn't look
as if you're proud of them.

956
00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Lamination,
there's big problems with that.

957
00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These look as though they've been sat on.

958
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hazelnut and chocolate.

959
00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Certainly got the hazelnut.

960
00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Tahini and lemon.

961
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, it's quite pleasant.

962
00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you close your eyes
and eat it, you think that's great.

963
00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But then you open your eyes
and see it and go, "Ah".

964
00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You are not getting
much lamination.

965
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

966
00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Maple and bacon,
it's extremely Canadian.

967
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flavour's lovely.

968
00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the consistency is quite doughy.

969
00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The crème pat and the blueberry,
these ones are quite raw.

970
00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] You are obviously disappointed

971
00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and in a way,
we are a bit disappointed, too.

972
00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bit of a mess.

973
00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Total mess.

974
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stacey, please bring up your sfogliatelle.

975
00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Erm... Sfog...

976
00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Stacey] Sfoglia-teenies.
So they're for the kids.

977
00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Oh, I see.

978
00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The lamination is very poor,

979
00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and there is too much icing sugar
on there, which is unusual for you.

980
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Normally, you smash something
like this and it looks good.

981
00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's the heat, I think.

982
00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Citrus and raisin...

983
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like that filling.

984
00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's the right degree
of sweetness.

985
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's very runny for a crème pat.

986
00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were so ambitious
to do a choux paste middle.

987
00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Your nightmare's come true.

988
00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The choux bun has burst out and on the top
there you have raw dough.

989
00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I appreciate the fact
that it's extremely difficult to do,

990
00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but everyone is in the same boat,
and we have to judge accordingly.

991
00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I agree.

992
00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] And this one, I think
you have let yourself down a little bit.

993
00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it was close to, in old money,
100 degrees in the tent.

994
00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have either of you ever worked
anywhere that was hotter?

995
00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I worked in Hong Kong in July
in an unairconditioned hotel kitchen.

996
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:34.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can better that.

997
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When I was working in the bakery

998
00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:40.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the temperature was 50 degrees,
all I had on were shorts.

999
00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I was a fire juggler
I lived on the edge of a volcano...

1000
00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I got on with it.

1001
00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>So going into this, Sophie</i>
<i>and Steven both in a very good place.</i>

1002
00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Is that still the case?</i>

1003
00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] <i>Yes, that's certainly the case.</i>

1004
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:55.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Both Steven and Sophie
are very skilful with their fingers.

1005
00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Liam's was a little bit tardy
on the overall size differences,

1006
00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:01.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the lamination he managed
to get, very clever.

1007
00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, Liam, Sophie
and Steven for star baker?

1008
00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And who is in the danger zone?

1009
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] <i>Yan's struggled, and she knew that.</i>

1010
00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, she didn't achieve any lamination,
they were undercooked.

1011
00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, there was a whole heap
of things wrong with Yan's.

1012
00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yan's struggled, hasn't she, all weekend?

1013
00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She has. I think Yan's had
a terrible week.

1014
00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think Kate is there as well.
It did look hideous.

1015
00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] <i>What about Stacey?</i>

1016
00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Not worth the calories.

1017
00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My ultimate test.

1018
00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fantastically well done to everybody.

1019
00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have never seen anybody have to do

1020
00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:56.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
such a tremendously difficult challenge
in this astonishing heat.

1021
00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was really, really tough.

1022
00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:01.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is my pleasure to announce
this week's star baker.

1023
00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The star baker is the person
who brought the flavours of Italy

1024
00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
absolutely bursting into our mouths

1025
00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with the cannoli and whose sfogliatelle
was a laminate perfection.

1026
00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The star baker is Steven.

1027
