00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Love the flavour.
The bitterness that comes through,

302
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's from the aperitif which you've got
in the jelly form. It's delicious.

303
00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think it looks particularly good,
but I do like the flavours.

304
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Particularly the rhubarb.
-Hmm.

305
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because the rhubarb cuts through
the general richness of it all.

306
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can I have a slug of that?
-[David] That's for you.

307
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The excuse is, it's a good palate clearer
for the next one.

308
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] True.

309
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks, David.
-Thanks.

310
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Okay. See you.
-[laughs]

311
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I absolutely love the colour.
I think the size of them is perfect.

312
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The base don't look too bad.

313
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Nice little bits of pulled sugar.
I like that.

314
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's a shame about the crème pât.

315
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs cooking out a bit more.
It's just a bit too soft.

316
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The jelly is perfect.
-It's a shame about the crème pât.

317
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not very neat down at the bottom
on any one of them.

318
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I like the design.
I love that, and the colours.

319
00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's akin to a lemon meringue pie.
-Okay.

320
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sharpness is there,
the flavours are there,

321
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but it's a bit too soft.
-Hmm.

322
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I agree it's a bit soft,
but if you were eating it as a pudding

323
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-with a spoon, you'd be fine.
-Yeah.

324
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Nearly perfect.
-Thanks.

325
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The dome, the shine you've achieved
is fantastic.

326
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The pipework is not particularly good.

327
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's such a pity, Alice,
because that one is near perfect,

328
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and some of the others
are really all over the place.

329
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the overall look
is pretty professional.

330
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, my goodness.
-[Paul] It's held together quite nicely.

331
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry's lovely and crisp.
Nice flavour.

332
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got a lovely buttery feel to it
'cause it crumbles in the mouth

333
00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:26.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it melts beautifully.
The orange comes through.

334
00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's quite a big tartlet.
-Yeah.

335
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But they are really good.

336
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The only thing that let you down
was the piping.

337
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-But your flavours and textures,

338
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the actual base is stunning.
The flavours are gorgeous. Well done.

339
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much.

340
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am so happy with that.

341
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will take that.
I'll take my rubbish piping any day.

342
00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They liked the flavours
and that's the most important thing.

343
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] <i>They're judging</i>
<i>quite harshly today.</i>

344
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're picking people up
on lots of little issues.

345
00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Their only negative was
that my crème pât wasn't set,

346
00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I did know that.

347
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I knew that mousse hadn't
set properly. I have no idea why.

348
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Technical might really matter
this week, with only four of us.

349
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Technical for patisserie
is quite terrifying.

350
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, patisserie Technical.
That's not gonna be easy, is it?

Hello, lovelies.
It's time for your Technical Challenge,

355
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which today has been set for you
by the lovely Prue.

356
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Any words of wisdom?

357
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is very difficult to make look good.

358
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, God.
-[Prue] Good luck.

359
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

360
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. As ever, this Technical Challenge
will be judged blind.

361
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, we have to ask these two cuties
to leave the tent.

362
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Off you pop.
-Bye.

363
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Where they going?
-I believe Prue is respraying Paul's tan.

364
00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. Prue would like you to make
gâteau St-Honoré.

365
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Named after?

366
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Obviously, St Honoré.
You knew that, right?

367
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Absolutely.
-The French patron saint

368
00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of bakers and pastry chefs.

369
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was like a Prue Leith of his day,
but without the challenging necklaces.

370
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Wow.
-Mm, yeah.

371
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, unlike the classic round gâteau shape
you may be familiar with,

372
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue would like your gâteau St-Honoré
to be rectangular

373
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and comprised of two layers.

374
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] The first layer
must be puff pastry,

375
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
followed by choux buns
dipped in sweet caramel,

376
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then filled
with a silky crème chiboust.

377
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've no idea
what you just said, have you?

378
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-Repeat that for the second layer

379
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and finish with piped Chantilly cream.

380
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You have three-and-a-half hours.
-On your marks...

381
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Get set...
-Bake!

382
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, there's a lot of writing here.

383
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like I have heard of it.
I can kind of picture what it looks like.

384
00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just gonna try and not stress.

385
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know what I'm doing.

386
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I made this a long time ago
and it went wrong

387
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I never made it again.

388
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They've definitely picked a difficult one,
but then we wouldn't expect any less.

389
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This looks pretty complicated.

390
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the semifinal,
it's not meant to be easy.

391
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a gâteau St-Honoré.

392
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's difficult to make it not look a mess.

393
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything has to be right.

394
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The choux buns have to be the right size.

395
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The creams have to be the right texture.

396
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pastry has to be thin
and neatly trimmed.

397
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They have to do puff pastry,
which is going to be difficult.

398
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think it's a great challenge.

399
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's one of the most wonderful
French patisseries.

400
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, that looks beautiful.
Nice crisp caramel.

401
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mmm. The choux pastry is filled
with really satiny crème chiboust,

402
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is basically crème pâtissière

[Paul] It's crispy puff.

404
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nicely set choux buns.

405
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you've got that softness coming
from the chiboust and from the Chantilly.

406
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The combination's fantastic.

407
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is worth every single calorie, Paul.

408
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

409
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll just get on with it.

410
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Er, we're making puff pastry. Full puff.

411
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're making full puff?
We're doing full puff.

412
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, let's go in.

413
00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] So, I've not done puff pastry
for a long time.

414
00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm definitely a rough puff kind of guy.

415
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a lot to do, and there's a lot
to think about and not mess up.

416
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] Don't wanna overwork this.

417
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perhaps need to roll it out quite thin.

418
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Put the butter on the dough
so it covers the bottom two-thirds,

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and do a single turn and chill."

420
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] "Single turn and chill."

421
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gosh. Just not nailing this.

422
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My dough is quite sticky.
I don't know if I should worry about that.

423
00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't know why.

424
00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. I'm gonna put it in the fridge.

425
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I should probably make my choux.

426
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I loved that programme.

428

I've heated up the water and butter,

431
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

432
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] Does this look like
choux pastry to you?

433
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's meant to form a V shape.

434
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

435
00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is this for the choux?
-[laughs]

436
00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite... It's quite firm.

438
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[high-pitched vocalising] Chosen one.

439
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's something to do with a triangle.
I'm not getting any triangles.

440
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

441
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

442
00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't listen to him, he's gone.

443
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

444
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't know why it's so thin.

445
00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

446
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

447
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't know if they're completely even,
but there we go.

448
00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're not all the right size.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosie] It's not a beautiful choux, is it?

450
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm putting these in.

451
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm thinking ten minutes.

452
00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosie] I'm gonna give them ten minutes.

453
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if they're not puffing up,
they get pulled and I start again.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Halfway through.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Alice, how long we got left?
-[Alice] Halfway through.

460
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are listening.

461
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, right, puff pastry.
That was resting for ages.

462
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, let's see where
we're going with this now.

463
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The next one's a book turn.

464
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, a book turn, we go like this.

465
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And like this, I think.

466
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then in half again.

467
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't really know how many times
I'm meant to turn this.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'Cause if the butter comes through
then you're gonna mess up

470
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the nice layers you're trying to get.

471
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Put you back in the freezer.

472
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, shall I see the choux?

473
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-My choux are puffing up okay.
-[Sandi] They're looking nice.

474
00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you're a choux-in.

475
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Those are puffing, but not very well.

476
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[David] They're done.
-[Alice] I have some choux buns.

477
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're okay.

478
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're all very different in size,
but whatevs.

479
00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosie] They're like little bricks.

480
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I might just start again.
I'm starting again.

481
00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] Let's roll this thing.

482
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, roll the pastry
into a 28-centimetre square.

483
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's meant to be
in sheets of laminated butter.

484
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This seems like it's more in chunks.
Chunky monkey.

485
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm trying to work out
why they haven't given us many folds.

486
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Probably 'cause if the layers are too thin
then the butter will just burst through.

487
00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] We're getting butter seepage.
Nothing to see here.

488
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just gonna leave it to chill again.
Chilling just sorts everything out.

489
00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rosie] It's happened again.
My choux pastry is liquid.

490
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know why. I don't understand.
I just don't understand.

491
00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, for goodness' sake,
this is not gonna work.

492
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's failed.

493
00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Goes to the graveyard of choux buns.

494
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, my pastry's failed as well.

495
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the butter's burst through.
You can see all the butter at the top.

496
00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've gotta remake everything.

Excuse me? Hello.

499
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have one hour. Just one hour.

500
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Erm, I might just go home now.
Oh, my God.

501
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] We'll put that puff pastry in.

502
00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are in the oven.

503
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] Place a large baking tray on top
and bake.

504
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Otherwise it goes... [mimics explosion]

505
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Darling, that's not a good face.

506
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm remaking my pastry, my choux.

508
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the second choux hasn't worked either.

509
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I make choux all the time.

510
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Slow down. What's the problem?

511
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My choux was too thin, I couldn't pipe it.
It was just blobs.

512
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[exhales heavily]
-Take a breath. You've got this, okay?

513
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't think I do have this.
-Yes, you do.

514
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, what's next?

515
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] "Make the crème chiboust."
Chi-boust? Chi-bousse?

516
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Chi-boost? Chiboust.

517
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, this is the crème pât.
I need to make it into a crème chiboust.

518
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If only I had concentrated more
in French lessons,

519
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then I might know what "chiboust" means.

520
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Je ne sais pas.</i> Don't know.

521
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The crème pât's thickening very fast,
to the point where it's splitting.

522
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Think if I get a whisk, I can sort it out.

523
00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Made a crème pâtissière before.

524
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've just read about the stiff egg whites,

525
00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'm assuming it's more
mousse-like, maybe.

526
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, three leaves gelatin.

527
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm, I have decided...

528
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
erm, just to stick
with my original pastry.

529
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Because I've got so much to remake.
-[David] You can do it.

530
00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If anyone can do it, you can.

531
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These egg whites look a bit ropey,
shall we say.

532
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So, I'm just folding this in.
-That's lovely. Pillowy.

533
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Want it to be smooth
'cause it's going inside my choux.

534
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's my third attempt at the choux,
and it still looks slack.

535
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But whatever, we're piping this.
This is being piped.

536
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] Just having a quick look
at this bad boy.

537
00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, that's pretty terrible as far
as how much butter's come out of it.

538
00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No idea what this is like, but I can see
it browning quite a lot on the edge.

539
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Think that might be done.

540
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh, you bastard.

541
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Didn't lift up at the edges, did it?

542
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not a great puff.

543
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm making my crème pât again.

544
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I forgot to add the gelatin because
I am a massive, massive idiot.

545
00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've done everything
either twice or three times.

546
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How long have we got left?

547
00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you got half an hour.

548
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is it cooked through? I dunno.
I'm going with it.

549
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The choux is in. Who knows
what it's gonna do? But it's in.

550
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not over. It's not over.

551
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Next is making a caramel
and then dipping these in it.

552
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is starting to colour. It should do.
Just don't want it to burn.

553
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lots can go wrong with caramel.

554
00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah.

555
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] Hope that's not burnt.

556
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I worry that that's too dark.
Too late now.

557
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I might just make the top ones
a little lighter.

558
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, right. So, let's try that again.

559
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The choux buns are actually puffing up.

560
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The choux are puffing. Thank God.

561
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fifteen minutes.

562
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do we assemble this bad boy?

563
00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Trim the sheet of puff pastry
and cut into two rectangles."

564
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sawing wood.

565
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything's ready to go,
apart from, obviously, the caramel.

566
00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please work.

567
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:11.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pipe a wide ribbon of crème chiboust
down the middle.

568
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This looked so nice when I was making it,
now it just looks congealed.

569
00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] Fill each choux bun
with crème chiboust. Ooh.

570
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can... Ooh. You can feel it going in.

571
00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't really know
if this is going in or not.

572
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm trying to see which ones
look vaguely reasonable.

573
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I feel like--
-Okay, let me tell you.

574
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-That guy, good. That guy, good.

575
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That guy's an idiot.

576
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] I don't know how
I'm gonna fit these on.

577
00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna have to

578
00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
make mine come off the edge
as much as I can.

579
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosie] Ow-ee, they're really hot.

580
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They look like choux buns.
Not beautiful choux buns,

581
00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but they are recognisably buns of choux.
-How long have we got?

582
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have five minutes left, bakers.

583
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] Do you like my two-tone caramel?

584
00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] This looks really terrible.

585
00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] Don't fall off now.

586
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] It just says "decorate".
I don't know what else I could do.

587
00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rosie] I've lost count.
Don't know if I've done enough,

588
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or too many, or anything now.
Lost track of everything.

589
00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] That's gonna be
as good as it gets.

590
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

caramel thing going on.

591
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rosie] Need to put the prettiest ones
on top.

592

She's got less to worry about
than she's worrying about.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

to the chiboust down here.

610
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, that's split.

611
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Good caramel.

612
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice and crackly and thin.

613
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a very nice pastry.
It's not perfect, but it's okay.

614
00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Moving on to number two.

615
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know when you get
the big holes here...

616
00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
normally an indication
that you have lost a bit of butter,

617
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you can see the flake anyway,
and it is thin.

618
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Choux buns look a bit irregular in colour.

619
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Some are dark, some are light.

620
00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chiboust is a little bit like
scrambled egg, but it tastes okay.

621
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the size of those choux buns,
they're not too big.

622
00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And moving on to this one.
The Chantilly cream's over-whipped.

623
00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The pastry looks good.

624
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Feels good. It's quite solid.

625
00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd say that caramel is overdone.

626
00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It is overdone.
You can taste the burnt caramel.

627
00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It's too strong.

628
00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] This looks quite delicate,
this one.

629
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Except that the choux buns
are all upside-down.

630
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got a nice flake, nice and thin.

631
00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Nice, crisp pastry.

632
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. How's the chiboust?

633
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's pretty smooth, isn't it?
-Hmm, good.

634
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The puff's good as well.

635
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I don't complain about this at all

636
00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
except that the choux buns
are definitely upside-down.

637
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are, for sure. Okay,

638
00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
this'll be an interesting judging.

639
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:30.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] <i>Prue and Paul will now rank</i>
<i>the gâteau St-Honoré from worst to best.</i>

640
00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, in fourth position is this one.
Whose is this?

641
00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Alice, you had a few issues with the puff.

642
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is problems with the Chantilly
and the chiboust as well,

643
00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you burnt the caramel on the bottom.

644
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In third place is this one.

645
00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Steph, a little untidy.

646
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Too much caramel,
so it's become a bit lumpy,

647
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but delicious.

648
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In second place is... this one.
Whose is this?

649
00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually not bad at all.
Looks like scrambled egg, the chiboust,

650
00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and there's a little bit of sogginess
running through the puff pastry as well.

651
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which leaves... this one.
Rosie. Well done, Rosie.

652
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's absolutely perfect
except the profiteroles are upside-down.

653
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Otherwise, it's delicious.

654
00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] I'm sorry.

655
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry. I'm sorry.

656
00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs] I-- I can't believe it.

657
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That was my most stressful bake...
and I won it.

658
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Another second.
The sixth second in a Technical.

659
00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Second will get you</i>
<i>all the way to the final.</i>

660
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Might not make you win the final,
but it'll get you there.

661
00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're gonna be picky,
it's the semifinal.

662
00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're not gonna let anything go.

663
00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've just gotta pick it up again tomorrow.

664
00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's not as many left now,
so your chances get less and less.

665
00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[indistinct chatter]

666
00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So yesterday, everybody chugging along.
Then I thought Rosie,

667
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
gonna crash and burn.
She came first in the Technical.

668
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I don't know where we are.</i>

669
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] <i>Steph, who's won Star Baker</i>

670
00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>more than anybody else,</i>
<i>struggled a little bit.</i>

671
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Her Signature tasted delicious,
but the texture was all wrong.

672
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] <i>What about David?</i>

673
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] <i>He struggled in his Signature,</i>

674
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>and it came down to the look of it.</i>

675
00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, I think the steady dark horse
in this race is Alice.

676
00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] <i>Alice is steady, usually,</i>
<i>but she did do a pretty poor Technical.</i>

677
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Knowing it's the final next week,
there is no room for error now.

678
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It may be the person who fails
rather than the person who triumphs?

679
00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think putting patisserie week
in a semifinal is pretty cruel.

680
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Was that your idea?
-[laughing]

681
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Masterstroke.
-[both imitate maniacal laughter]

682
00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get that man a white cat.

683
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Morning, bakers. Welcome to your
semifinal Showstopper Challenge.

684
00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Today, the judges would like you to create

685
00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a spectacular sugar glass display case,
completely transparent.

686
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And inside, there needs to be
an edible depiction of something

687
00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that you hold precious
to you in your life.

688
00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know we all love him,
but it can't be Noel, okay?

689
00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:16.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could be me.
I could totally fit in a glass case.

690
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Totally.

691
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your glass case
can be any shape that you like,

692
00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the object inside must contain
at least one baked element.

693
00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know what I'm talking about.
Cakes, biscuits, that kind of thing.

694
00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You have four-and-a-half hours.

-Get set...
-Bake.

696
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm trying to tell myself I'm calm,

697
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and if I keep telling myself,
it might happen.

698
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is a bit surreal that this is the bake
that could get us into the final,

699
00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I'm not really thinking about that.

700
00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:45.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm thinking about whether I can do it.
So, yeah, I'm scared.

701
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What we want is
a real celebration of patisserie.

702

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

exquisite pastries.

-You'll be fine, Steph.
-[Steph] Thank you.

813

-I'm allergic to opera, sorry.
-Oh, God.

814
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look at this cake.

815
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are the tarte Tropézienne.
Do not quote my pronunciation.

816
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we're shoddy on a few,
then it's gonna have to be what it is

817
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because it's as good as it gets.

818
00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sugar glass cabinet challenge.

819
00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think this plays to the strengths
of most of them.

820
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] That's the Genoise sponge.

821
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Alice is the one that's surprised me.
She's really going for it now.

822
00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:38.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's got curd, she's got Bavarois,
she's got Genoise sponge.

823
00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This one's fine.
The raspberry one is set,

824
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's just more mousse-y
than I would've liked.

825
00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:48.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Next, we're doing the crème au beurre.
It's basically a buttercream, super-rich.

826
00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Steph's doing a straightforward opera cake
with a few macarons.

827
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] This is for my macarons.

828
00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I've not made macarons
in the competition.

829
00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've barely made them in life.

830
00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've put the choux in the oven.

831
00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rosie's got quite a lot to do

832
00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause she's making the religieuse
and the Tropézienne.

833
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All my stuff is patisserie
because it's patisserie week.

834
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm trying to do
a celebration of patisserie.

835
00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, yeah, much, much patisserie.

836
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] This is a fancy piece
of equipment.

837
00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cuts your cake perfect.

838
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] David's doing a lot of sponges.
Is that delicate enough?

839
00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Yeah, David's might just give us
a great big cake.

840
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I'm ahead of time.
How long's it been?

841
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't spin that too fast
'cause I'll take off.

842
00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is this it?
I asked for an air-conditioning unit.

843
00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna complain.

844
00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you've got three hours left.

845
00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit of a breeze.

846
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] Right, just don't panic. Right.

847
00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything needs to be in the freezer
in five minutes.

848
00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need to pour my Bavarois in.

849
00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going in with these macarons.

850
00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosie] My choux looks okay.

851
00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] I'm gonna set this
for as long as possible.

852
00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How are you? [laughs]

853
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Choux was not your friend yesterday.

854
00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, see? Look. Already perfection.

855
00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Functional choux.

856
00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Functional choux", like a lace-up brogue.

857
00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, now I need to get on
with some biscuits.

858
00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The glass box, it's gonna be supported
by a biscuit edge.

859
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, I'm making six biscuit frames.

860
00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are my windows,
sort of an old-style Parisian window.

861
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] It's spiced biscuit dough.
I wanna get these baked.

862
00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] I'm just gonna go
in the oven with this.

863
00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About 15 minutes.

864
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, I need to pull myself together.

865
00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you tell I'm starting to panic?
It's gonna be really tight.

866
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you are halfway through.

867
00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is in preparation for some isomalt.

868
00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] <i>Isomalt is a sugar substitute</i>

869
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>that doesn't caramelise</i>

870
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isomalt is just a sugar. It is just sugar.

871
00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Inverted sugar is what isomalt is.

872
00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] This stuff gets so hot.

873
00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's about 300 degrees
or something when it's melted.

874
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Yep.

876
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For this, 'cause it's hot,
or for anything really stinky.

877
00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing] "Stinky"? What would be stinky?

878
00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not talking about smellies.

879
00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Come on.
-No.

880
00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whisper. What's the smelliest thing
you've come across?

881
00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Many things smell.

882
00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anything's that gone a bit horrible.
Nasty abscesses can smell bad.

883
00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lots of things can smell bad.

884
00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Mmm.

885
00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is more interesting than the show.
We should do a spin-off.

886
00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:14.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Got all my panes,
so they're ready to fill with isomalt.

887
00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] Yeah, that's fine.

888
00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The strength of the biscuit
is such an integral part to the bake.

889
00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

890
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

That is the aim.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

blowtorching the bubbles off the back,

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] All right?

916
00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All this baking's making me
feel a bit peckish.

917
00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, that's why I got you these.
Delicious crisps.

918
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never heard of those.

919
00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They're really good.
-This is not one of your tricks again?

920
00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't be ridiculous. Go for it.
-Sure? 'Cause we're a double act.

921
00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I know and I love you.
-It's all about trust.

922
00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, go for it.

923
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

924
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bak-- [laughs]

925
00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:40.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have one hour.

926
00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've gotta have eye surgery now.
I hope you're happy.

927
00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi laughing]

928
00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm quite behind,
but, erm, I don't really know...

929
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Erm... gonna try one of these macarons.

930
00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Think they're meant to be
more chewy than that.

931
00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] Right, don't panic.

932
00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is my mirror glaze.
I need to get my cake out the freezer.

933
00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] There's less than an hour.
I'm feeling very stressy.

934
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] It's been in the freezer
for quite a while.

935
00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm starting to panic
'cause I've got an hour left.

936
00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just need this to work.

937
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're not normally this stressed.
-Can you make it work?

938
00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do you mean?
I'm always this stressed.

939
00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't normally have to calm you down.

940
00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to calm down Rosie
or I have to calm down Steph.

941
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to get David more agitated.
That's my main job.

942
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoo.

943
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Assembly time for the cake.

944
00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] I've got a beetroot prune cake
on the bottom.

945
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then I'm gonna have
a layer of parsnip,

946
00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
maple syrup cream cheese icing
to go in between those.

947
00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rosie] These are
my little tartes Tropézienne.

948
00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:33.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are a bit dry, but they're getting
massive wad of cream in there.

949
00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cream fixes everything.

950
00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] I think we're done.

951
00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] Right,
I need to make isomalt coral.

952
00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[David] This is my buttercream
for the succulents.

953
00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Happy?
-Yes, just everything's a bit busy today.

954
00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know, I've been lying down.
Is it a busy one?

955
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah, definitely.

956
00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Look how quick you are
with that business.

957
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've gotta be quick.

958
00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-If you were doing this on your own...
-I wouldn't do this on my own.

959
00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs] Why would you?
It'd be too weird.

960
00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe.

961
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm really, really behind.

962
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once I've done this, it's time
to start thinking about the glass box.

963
00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the next bit of fun.

964
00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have half an hour.
Just half an hour.

965
00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can do a lot in half an hour.
I'm in panic mode now.

966
00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The construction bit
will be the difficult bit.

967
00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the stage where you've got
to start being very delicate.

968
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you break it, gone.

969
00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a challenge.
We all like challenges, don't we?

970
00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's likely to be my downfall,
shall we say.

971
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

972
00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm assembling.
I just need to have a glass case.

973
00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] How will I do this fit?

974
00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] I'm gluing it with the isomalt.

975
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:49.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] Probably isn't the best way
to do this, but needs must.

976
00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:54.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rosie] I am not confident about it
in the slightest.

977
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[David] It's quite art deco, this design.

978
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] I'm going for rustic.

979
00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, if I'm really honest, it is me.

980
00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not perfect. How long have we got?

981
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bakers, you have...
-15 minutes left, 15 minutes.

982
00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steph] He's lying, isn't he?

983
00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:09.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, got to make chocolate soil.

984
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rosie] This is crème pât.
This is going in my little tarte.

985
00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm really, really stressed.

986
00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alice] I'm just making
a chocolate starfish.

987
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Literally just moulding it
with some coloured white chocolate.

988
00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] We'll just freestyle a little bit
with the decoration.

989
00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the elements are there.
Er, it's wonky.

990
00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] Right, which is the front?

991
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The box goes over the cake.

992
00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have one minute.
Just one minute.

993
00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] I don't know what to do.

994
00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:44.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rosie] Gonna hold this in place
and hope the caramel sets.

995
00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:48.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steph] Probably a bit clumsy,
but nearly there.

996
00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alice] I don't know if I can glue that.

997
00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, bakers, your time is up.

998
00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

999
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit of a mess, but it is done.

1000
00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>It's judgment time for</i>
<i>the bakers' showstopping sugar cabinets.</i>

1001
00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Steph, please bring up
your sugar glass case.

1002
00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:35.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's pretty clear.
It's quite like old antique glass.

1003
00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you've done a good job.

1004
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Let's have a look.

1005
00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:40.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very neat.

1006
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very dark chocolate.

1007
00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:49.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That looks very pretty.

1008
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're a very good baker, Stephanie.
-Oh.

1009
00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:04.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You really are.

1010
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sponge is more dense
than I'd have liked,

1011
00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but on the other hand,
you've got so many layers,

1012
00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if it had been very light,
it would've been difficult.

1013
00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's very patisserie in its style
by the use of the macarons.

1014
00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything you've done is very neat,
very tidy, very Steph,

1015
00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the box is good, too.

1016
00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I think you've done a good job.
Thank you.

1017
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very neat.

1018
00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I love the coloured glass.
It's quite clear.

1019
00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You can see through it.
It's a bit mottled in places.

1020
00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] That's very neat, too.
-[Paul] It is very neat.

1021
00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It has to be absolutely level,
and it's not, 'cause it bends down.

1022
00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's wonderfully light.

1023
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:04.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like a very good carrot cake.

1024
00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite spicy, as always with you.

1025
00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Blindfolded, I'd know that was yours.
-[chuckles]

1026
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Patisserie week is all about delicacy,
finesse, intricate detail,

1027
00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I think by putting sponge on sponge
on sponge on sponge,

1028
00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's slightly wayward.

1029
00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need something
more delicate, more finesse.

1030
00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] I absolutely agree.

1031
00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It would've been better if there'd been
a bit more showing off of patisserie work.

1032
00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:46.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the look of it.
Does look like old glass.

1033
00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a good concept.

1034
00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit simplistic,
considering it's a showpiece,

1035
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-it's a centrepiece, it's a showstopper.
-Yeah.

1036
00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:56.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's difficult is it's the same colour
all the way around.

1037
00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] What you've done is interesting

1038
00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause you've taken
a concept like time and family,

1039
00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's the concept
that pulls them all together

1040
00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
not the gastronomic dish.

1041
00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These are a bit boring, a bit dry.

1042
00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Dry and floury.
-Yeah, there's no flavour to it.

1043
00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The little tarte
in the middle's delicious.

1044
00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks.

1045
00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The religieuse are a little bit
off the mark as well

1046
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-'cause they're so small.
-Okay.

1047
00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] You need to pack more of a punch.

1048
00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But making that a centrepiece,
it's a tricky one, that one.

1049
00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the mix
that doesn't quite work.

1050
00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:51.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can't really see much of it,
to be honest.

1051
00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] If it'd been clear,
it would be astonishing.

1052
00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is really lovely,

1053
00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:00.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I like the boldness
that you've done a really big one.

1054
00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, lovely flavour.

1055
00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very nice, the whole fresh raspberries
in there.

1056
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] There is flavour in there.
It's not particularly strong.

1057
00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The strong part of it is the raspberry.

1058
00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The raspberry comes through beautifully.

1059
00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The weakness is the mousse
down at the bottom.

1060
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-It's not very mousse-like.

1061
00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your display is very good,

1062
00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it really shows off
what your theme was.

1063
00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you'd have asked me about an hour ago,

1064
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I would've said I was going home,
but I hope I've turned it around.

1065
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosie] <i>Yeah, it wasn't great.</i>

1066
00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just a bit gutted to be honest,
just a bit gutted. Yeah.

1067
00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:51.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is patisserie week
and I didn't really do a patisserie.

1068
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>They said it was more cake,</i>
<i>and that's what I was dreading.</i>

1069
00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Am I gonna be penalised</i>
<i>'cause that's not very patisserie?</i>

1070
00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was pretty tight
coming into the Showstopper.

1071
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do we feel they did?

1072
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's moved round a bit.

1073
00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Alice has done a great job.
That's a decent-looking entremets.

1074
00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Steph did a great job.

1075
00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She really bounced back,
actually, in the Showstopper.

1076
00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] She showed us
a lot of patisserie skills.

1077
00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:23.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And ones who you were not impressed by,

1078
00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the one that looks like a...

1079
00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks like a sandwich, doesn't it?

1080
00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's basically a stack of sponge cakes,

1081
00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:32.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and although it's technically patisserie,
it's not what we were asking for.

1082
00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] His cabinet, though, was very good.

1083
00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:38.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we have to tick the elegant column,
that's not gonna happen with Rosie's?

1084
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] No.
-[Paul] I have serious issues with this.

1085
00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because the little cakes that she made
are so dry,

1086
00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
no flavour in them whatsoever.

1087
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think picking Star Baker's
gonna be that difficult.

1088
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the hard one is
who's gonna leave us at this late stage.

1089
00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's the worst time to go out, right?
-It is, because you're nearly there.

1090
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I trust you two. We'll go away
for five hours while you talk about it?

1091
00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Yes, I think so.
-We could be a while.

1092
00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hello, bakers.
Well done for all your hard work.

1093
00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got the great job this week
of announcing the Star Baker

1094
00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the person that will be going
straight through to the final.

1095
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, the Star Baker this week is...

1096
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Alice.

1097
00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[clapping]
-[Sandi] Well done.

1098
00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You're in the final.
-[Sandi] Congratulations.

1099
00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, that means I have the horrible job.
It gets so difficult.

1100
00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Er, one of you will not be going through
to the final.

1101
00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can I just say very well done to everybody
before I announce it,

1102
00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I'm afraid the person
who will not be joining us next week is...

1103
00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rosie. I'm so sorry.

1104
00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You did so well.
-It's okay.

1105
00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You did an amazing job.
You pulled it back together.

1106
00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:16.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yesterday, you were incredible.

1107
00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done, sweetheart. I'm so sorry.

1108
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rosie] <i>I'm gutted. I am gutted.</i>

1109
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just have to be happy with everything
that I've done so far.

1110
00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Rosie. You did so well.

1111
00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul said it was just that one part
of that last bake.

1112
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:31.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rosie tried to show a lot of skills,

1113
00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>but they weren't</i>
<i>a good collection together</i>

1114
00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and she didn't do them particularly well.

1115
00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] <i>Rosie slipped up...</i>

1116
00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, Rosie.

1117
00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...which is the saddest part about it.

1118
00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But you are a bloody good baker.
