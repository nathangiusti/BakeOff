27
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

It's a bit tense but I'm just gonna do
what I need to do, just crack on.

36
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's the final and the Signature challenge
is doughnuts, one of my favourite things.

37
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's actually quite difficult
to make properly.

38
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're looking for
an aerated texture inside,

39
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
beautiful and golden brown on the outside
and flavours that pack a punch.

40
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keep it simple but keep it perfect.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The fascinating thing
about this final

42
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is that all of our bakers have won
Star Baker twice.

43
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's a totally level playing field,
there's nobody who's out front,

44
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's genuinely a fantastic competition
for a final.

45
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

49
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And when you cut into a doughnut
what are we looking for?

50
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very good question, I never had doughnut
in my life before I made this challenge.

51
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Really?
[Rahul] No.

52
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is there no equivalent in India
in cooking?

53
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. And here I have seen doughnut

54
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I feel it would just look like
a deep-fried bread, I'm not gonna eat it.

It's always the really
nerve-wracking part.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ruby] Right, it's getting there.
[Rahul] That's fine, it's there.

206
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

207
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

208
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

209
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ruby] I go for two and a half minutes

210
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The last thing you want is like raw dough.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they're raw in the middle,
it's gonna be the worst thing ever.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

217
00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

218
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] I did 'em 45 seconds. 40, 45...

219
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Is there extra stress today?

220
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pretty normal stress, stress.
You know Rahul.

221
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Sandi] Yes, sure.
-So just like a Rahul stress.

222
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, no, no, no, no. Don't do that.

223
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's got a massive air bubble.
Do I just pop it?

224
00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] Two doughnuts coming out.

225
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh, they're a bit paler than normal.
Maybe the oil's not as hot.

226
00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] Now, I think these should be done
by now.

227
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is probably more than done.
This is burnt actually.

228
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, no, no, no, no.

229
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kim-Joy] That one out.
I think these are a bit darker.

230
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's a bit misshapen, isn't he?
Don't tell them this.

231
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, no. I just get carried away,
get this over.

232
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

233
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Bakers, you have...

234
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fifteen minutes left.

235
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] I'm gonna fill these guys.

236
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just filling in my dulce de leche.

237
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm weighing because I want
the same quantity in each one.

238
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] I quite like doughnut with lots
of filling in. Is it actually filling?

239
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did I put filling in that one?

240
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've forgotten which one
I've put these into now.

241
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] Oh, that one's a heavy one.

242
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rahul] Is it actually working?

243
00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh no, no, no, no, no.
This is such a big mess.

244
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] You've got mango on
your wrist and on your collar.

245
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your wife's gonna think you've been
having an affair with a mango.

246
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I don't think I would be having
a fruity affair.

247
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing]

248
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] It's a lemon glaze.

249
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tricky thing is
getting the right thickness.

250
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] That is just white chocolate.

251
00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're going to hate it.

252
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Probably going to look like
a cake rather than a doughnut.

253
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

254
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

255
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] You've got to be kidding me.
I need to start doing the other ones.

256
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, stop it. They're a bit drippy.

257
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kim-Joy] I hope the judges will love
my decoration.

258
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] I'm going to be really pushed
for time, as usual.

259
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] Ah, my hands are way too shaky.

260
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] Not going very well.
Not going very well.

261
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ooh, come on.

262
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm done. Finalist-worthy doughnuts.

263
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] Urgh, drip, drip, drip.

264
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, your time is up. Please place your
doughnuts at the end of your stations.

265
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Final Signature done.

266
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Final Signature done.
Whatever happens happens.

267
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Happens.

268
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>It's judgement time for</i>
<i>the bakers' last Signature challenge.</i>

269
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hello, Kim-Joy.
-Hi, Kim-Joy.

270
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The ring doughnuts are very un-uniform.

271
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That doughnut there is quite dark.

272
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then this one here is quite light.

273
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So there's a little bit
of inconsistency in this.

274
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We'll start on the ring doughnut.

275
00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The shape of its pretty good,
it's nice and round.

276
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And as always with Kim-Joy
the decoration is very delicate...

277
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It is.
[Prue] ...carefully done.

278
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Nice texture inside.

279
00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Hmm, nice and light.

280
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm, very nice and lemony.

281
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It works out as a doughnut.

282
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's got a nice colour,
it's got a great texture

283
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it's got a great flavour.

284
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look at one of these.

285
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh wow, these are heavy,
you've got a lot of filling in there.

286
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] This is the one
with the almond liqueur?

287
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

288
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Lots of filling.

289
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm, very almondy.

290
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a great flavour.

291
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] It really is a lovely flavour.
-Ah.

292
00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you've got it just right
'cause quarter of a teaspoon more,

293
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
almond liqueur
and it would've been too much.

294
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Kim-Joy.
-I might I come back and eat that.

295
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're welcome.
[laughing]

296
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great designs on the top.

297
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the decoration is very clever.

298
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it's got a little bit of dripping
round the ring doughnuts.

299
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look at these.

300
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got a nice texture inside.

301
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-It's light.

302
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

303
00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because you've used the chocolate
you've got all that.

304
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] It's, it's very sticky.

305
00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'm not sure that
that's the right way to go.

306
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] The basic doughnut is excellent.
-Yeah.

307
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've just spoilt it a bit
with too sweet, too sticky topping.

308
00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's have a look at the, the filled.

309
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These are under filled.

310
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit boring.

311
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Ruby] Right, okay.
-You needed lots of that filling in there.

312
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if you did that you really would need
a lighter icing

313
00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-because how much sugar can you get?
-So much sugar, isn't it? Yeah.

314
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you, Ruby.
-Thank you very much.

315
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I don't even think I filled that one.

316
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rahul, I think the colours
are absolutely amazing.

317
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, they have such personality.

318
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Slightly over decorated for a ring
doughnut? I dunno, probably.

319
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Rahul] Probably, yeah.
-It depends what it's gonna bring

320
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to the flavour.

321
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like a doughnut you'd get
at a funeral and that makes me happy.

322
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

323
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Looks a tad on the dark side...
-[Rahul] Yes.

324
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...a bit oily.

325
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think overall
your texture is a little bit tight.

326
00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's under proved.

327
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My issue is there's far too much
buttercream on there.

328
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You do get that orange flavour
but we're tasting butter.

329
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The last thing I wanna do when I'm eating
a doughnut is to taste butter.

330
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But let's have a look at one of these.

331
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One thing I do like is the height

332
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you've got off your filled doughnuts,
they're massive.

333
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] Oh, it's too much filling.
[Prue] Oh my goodness. That is plenty.

334
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That texture's much better,
lighter than the first one.

335
00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I do like that mango filling.

336
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like a little mango bomb,
'cause it is absolutely...

337
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Stuffed.
-Thank you very much, Rahul.

338
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks, Rahul.
-Thanks a lot.

339
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you lay some of those on my gravestone
when I die?

340
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh no, don't say that.

341
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew it was too much icing.

342
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do agree with their feedback totally.

343
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dear me. It's not great but hey, hey,
what it is, it is now.

344
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wasn't the best of starts.
I never like making it easy.

345
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just gonna keep on going, keep positive
and focus on the next challenge.

346
00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They loved the flavours
and I think Prue seemed to really like it.

347
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's my last chance to win a Technical
which would be lovely,

348
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I'm not gonna put
any pressure on myself.

349
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:06.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

351
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] It is hot.

352

Hello bakers, welcome back to the tent
to your last ever Technical challenge,

354
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which today has been set for you
by the lovely Paul. Any words of advice?

355
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Make good use of your heat source.

356
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well that's pretty good advice
in any kitchen setting I would imagine.

357
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, off you two go.

358
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For your Technical challenge today,

359
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
first thing I have to tell you
is that your ovens are out of bounds

360
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and so too are your workbenches

361
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because we are going outside.

362
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please pick up your gingham-covered trays
and come with us.

363
00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rahul laughs]

364
00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

365
00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] In your own time.

366
00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ruby] This is cruel.
[Sandi] Out you come.

367
00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] Oh this is fun.

368
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Come on, Rahul.
[Ruby] Thank you.

369
00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Rahul] It's heavy.

370
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ruby] Okay. I have no idea
what is going on.

371
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] Oh, there's a fire.

372
00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] Interesting. Right.

373
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

374
00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So today, for your Technical challenge

375
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Paul would like you to bake six pitta
breads on the campfire in front of you.

376
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And he wants you to serve three dips
of baba ganoush,

377
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a smoked garlic salsa verde
and a burnt pepper salsa.

378
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Urgh.
-You have 90 minutes.

379
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-On your marks...
-Get set...

380
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bake.

381
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] <i>Like with any other</i>

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crazy.

387
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never really cooked in a fire before.

388
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why would I do that?
People would think I've gone mad.

389

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] I have no idea what I'm doing.

391
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just don't know.

392
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bear Grylls eat your heart out.

393
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So Paul, you have asked the bakers
for campfire pitta bread.

394
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] We've never done anything
like this before.

395
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This technique of baking bread
on a hot stone

396
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
has been around for thousands of years.

397
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's a great challenge
for 'em for the final.

398
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, the character of a pitta bread
is a pocket.

399
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is critical on this challenge.

400
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you make a good pitta bread, it puffs
up like a balloon when it's cooking.

401
00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] If the temperature
of the slate gets too hot

402
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it kills the yeast and it'll actually bake
a bit like a flatbread

403
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and will not get the pocket.

404
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, the other element is the three dips.

405

We've given them
lots of ingredients to play with

406
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's up to them
to come up with something

407
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that goes really well
with the pitta bread.

408
00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can taste the roasted aubergine, hmm.

409
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fantastic. I expect they never have
come across anything like this before.

410
00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're probably gonna get
a little bit hot under the collar,

411
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-because working over that stove itself...
-Maybe that.

412
00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...the temperature is going to be extreme.

413
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm actually cooking alive, I feel like.

414
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For the pitta make dough
and leave to prove.

415
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pitta would have to be pretty wet.

416
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm trying to remember when I last made
pitta bread. I can't remember.

417
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've made pitta bread before
but it was quite a while ago.

418
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Knead it till it's nice and elastic.

419
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's wholemeal flour, so I'm thinking
I still need to work it quite a bit.

420
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm trying to do the windowpane test.

421
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not working
so it definitely need a little bit more.

422
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Another minute. Oh, my God.

423
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My eyebrows are gonna be

[Noel] I've been to hell,
it's similar to this.

425
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This feels like hell.

426
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe you've died
and this is just you in hell.

427
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] Lovely. Thanks for that.

428
00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] I think this is done.

429
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ruby] Right, I'm just gonna
let it sit now.

430
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] I'll give it 30 minutes.

431
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ouch. I will leave it here
next to the fire.

432
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whilst the dough is proving
make your three dips.

433
00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To make the three dips make sure the logs
are burnt down so there is little flame.

434
00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Burnt down.

435
00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know. There is flames there.

436
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just poke it a little bit.
That's what you do, isn't it?

437
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] Need to put some coal on it,
that's a good idea.

438
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So no flame, good.

439
00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So add the vegetables to log and roast
until cooked through and blackened.

440
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

441
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So do you just add the veg whole?

442
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To the logs.

[Rahul] The fire is not turning down,
it is going up.

446
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't like what I'm doing.
I have no idea why I'm doing it.

448
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn't say how long to cook it for,
it just says blacken them.

450
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just rolling off the fire.

451
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is it supposed to sit straight
on the fire?

452
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't it?

453
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need help. Am I doing it right?

454
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't really tell you that, Rahul.

455
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Thanks.

456
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whoops.

457
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Darling, you look panicked.

458
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know what I'm doing.

459
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just hoped putting
some charcoal would help

460
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I feel like maybe
that's not a good idea.

461
00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] It's not so much fire
over that side.

462
00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I think I'm gonna put it there.

463
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

465
00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you have one hour left.

466
00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Come on, then.
-Let's go.

467
00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Ah, right in the face.

468
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

471
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then combine with
the rest of the ingredients.

472
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

combine the flesh of the aubergine

without a masher.

477
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

553
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are baked, but they are
more of a flatbread than a pitta.

555
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

561
00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

They are thinner.

562
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But it's very charred
and the za'atar's burnt.

564
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

570
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's try these dips.

571
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's not very salsa verde,
it's got za'atar in it as well, hasn't it?

572
00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hmm. That one piece just stabbed me

573
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Pepper.

574
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

575
00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's a nice blend.

576
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, it's gonna be quite tricky.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In third spot, this one.

579
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ruby, these weren't too bad but the big
problem I had was with the breads.

580
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's fine.

581
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, in second place we have this one.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rahul, if this had been a competition
about dips you might've come top, I think.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

too charred and a bit thick.

584
00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

we have this one.

585
00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

but they weren't perfect.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

they're not too bad

590
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he really means, they're quite good.

591
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

592
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I won a Technical.
Finally. It's my first one.

593

but I've had to come back against worse.

have my glass of milk and literally
put my best, put my everything into it.

it was so close.

They worked this hard, been here this long
and it's all down to this last challenge.

622

For your last ever Showstopper challenge

624
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

625
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your landscape should be a delight
for the senses, visually exciting,

626
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
texturally stunning and a taste sensation.

627
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, we don't need to remind you,
this is your last chance to shine.

Just to rub it in, yeah.

630

-It's your last chance to shine.
-[Sandi] This is it guys, yeah. Come on.

631
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have four and a half hours.

632

-On your marks...
-[Noel] Get set...

633
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Bake.

634
00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The beginning bit is when
I'm usually more stressed.

635
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, nothing big happening today,
just the final.

636
00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm extraordinarily excited.
I'm quite nervous too.

637
00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that this time the concept
is almost as important as the bake.

638
00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we're looking for a landscape
that we're not expecting

639
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that is perfectly executed.

640
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It needs to have at least
three elements in there.

641
00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it's a cake,
nice and light, full of flavour.

642
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Biscuits, a nice snap.

643
00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So all the criteria

644
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it's all happening in this one challenge.

645
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm wary about some of them
having such ambitious plans

646
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that they won't finish.

647
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's 32 degrees and rising.

648
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They really have gotta keep their heads.

649
00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have no idea who's gonna win this final.

650

651
00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:34.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I have to soak them

843
00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I just need to pipe it

846
00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

847
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So there's white chocolate

849
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need to airbrush the building,
make it look a bit mouldy.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Trying to multitask at the minute.
I've got caramel going on here.

854
00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

855
00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

857
00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

861
00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually I think I can still use it,
anyway. How much time have I got?

862
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

when I can put the choux's on.

864

868
00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Rahul, I do not know where, but he's got
a magic wand that he keeps pulling out.

922
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If Rahul wins
he probably won't believe it.

923
00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He'll probably still think he's not
good enough to have won it.

924
00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely Team Ruby all the way.

925
00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good luck whoever. Whoever, I don't know.

[Noel] <i>It's judgement time</i>
<i>for the showstopping edible landscapes. </i>

927
00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ruby, would you like to bring
your showstopper up please?

928
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yikes.

929
00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Shall I help you?
-Yes, please.

930
00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ruby, can you tell us all
about your landscape, please?

931
00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have done a magical landscape.

932
00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have a choux mountain,
filled with lemon crème pat

933
00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and there's also
a blueberry dipping sauce.

934
00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is a passionfruit cake
and a unicorn.

935
00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm very impressed you've managed to make
the choux pastry look really rocky.

936
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'd like this to have been made.

937
00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:10.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was making it out of isomalt
and I suffered a few burns at the end.

938
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Shall we try
this biscuit first?

939
00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ruby] So it's cardamom
and orange buttercream.

940
00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very nice, crisp shortbread.

941
00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hmm, it's got a nice flavour to that.
It's buttery, that's how it should be.

942
00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That's very good.

943
00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] What were these mushrooms?

944
00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It did have a mint chantilly
and there was a raspberry gel

945
00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they did look really effective
at the start, but it was just heat.

946
00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Beautiful flavour. That mint
really comes through, doesn't it?

947
00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Hmm, it is really delicious.
-Thank you.

948
00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Beautiful sponge.
[Prue] Isn't it?

949
00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the flavour with the passionfruit
goes really well together.

950
00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Ooh, that is lovely.

951
00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite bitter.

952
00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that was the caramel.

953
00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've overcooked it.

954
00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] But the crème pat's good
and some nice choux pastry.

955
00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just a pity about the caramel.

956
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that overall the idea is good,
the flavour's very tasty.

957
00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much.

958
00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rahul, please bring up your Showstopper.
Would you like a hand?

959
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, please. Thank you.

960
00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rahul, tell us about your Showstopper.

961
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So this Showstopper is my interpretation
of a rock garden.

962
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is a chocolate cake there,
within which is buttercream,

963
00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
orange flavoured

964
00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and there is a choux mound
on the top of that.

965
00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the other one is a lemon joconde

966
00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then like a pond
is basically coloured orange curd

967
00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the outside is choux pastry
filled with cream mousseline

968
00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a little touch of cardamom.

969
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then all around there is a chocolate
soil and then some small little biscuits

970
00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and like a stepping stone.

971
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, I just talk a lot.

972
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite impressive,
there's a bit of a height to it.

973
00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It does look very natural
as well, doesn't it?

974
00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It does. But I can't say
it makes my mouth water.

975
00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's the sludge
puts you off a bit.

976
00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Just remind me
what the stepping stones are made of?

977
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Orange and ginger biscuit.

978
00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dip it into the sludge.

979
00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's delicious.
-It is absolutely delicious.

980
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That biscuit melts in the mouth.

981
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the biscuit is very well judged
with the curd.

982
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The choux buns
look hideous, don't they?

983
00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So if I open my mouth wide enough,

984
00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will be getting praline, choux,
cardamom and some caramel on the top?

985
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tiny bit.

986
00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] There we go.

987
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You do get the cardamom and it is...
it's juicy inside.

988
00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is it good?
-Delicious.

989
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn't, it doesn't taste
what it looks like.

990
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it all comes into your taste buds
one after another and it's lovely.

991
00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Oh, look at that.

992
00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:45.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] This is lemon joconde and...
[Prue] Joconde.

993
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:46.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...Italian meringue buttercream.

994
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That's a lovely joconde.

995
00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's well-baked. You see how aerated
that sponge is

996
00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the overall flavour's excellent.

997
00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, let's take a look
at this chocolate cake.

998
00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

999
00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I hadn't had the joconde first,
I would say that was an exceptional cake.

1000
00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's a good cake.

1001
00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The orange
with the chocolate is delicious.

1002
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And that cake is perfectly baked.

1003
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You are so clever
at thinking things through

1004
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and your flavours are so good.

1005
00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done. Thank you.

1006
00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:23.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks a lot.

1007
00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[blows]

1008
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:35.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kim-Joy, would you like to bring your
Showstopper up please?

1009
00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you want some help?

1010
00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kim-Joy] Yes, please?
[Noel] Okay. Have you got it?

1011
00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Wow.

1012
00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, I've done the Lost City of Atlantis.

1013
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] So we've got ginger biscuit,
we've got ginger cake and the...

1014
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kim-Joy] Caramel.
[Paul] Caramel.

1015
00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kim-Joy] And the praline, yeah.
[Prue] And praline.

1016
00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well I think it's very original
and it's very colourful

1017
00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and some of the work
is really quite delicate.

1018
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:05.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd like to have seen more height
with the cake, 'cause it's quite flat.

1019
00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:17.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's really like Jamaican
sticky ginger cake.

1020
00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The ginger cake's delicious,
it's well baked.

1021
00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do question the flavour of the orange
with that ginger.

1022
00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you use zest in that?

1023
00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-[Paul] It's extract?
-So it's the oils.

1025
00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it was zest it would be
much more citrusy

1026
00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a bit more tang to it.

1027
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice caramel.

1028
00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a nice ginger biscuit.

1029
00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the problem is, I think you would've
been wise to have done a different flavour

1030
00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because the ginger cake is so gingery

1031
00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that the biscuit is a bit
of a disappointment after it.

1032
00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's a missed opportunity.

1033
00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What you've got is a biscuit,
a ginger cake and a praline,

1034
00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
blitzed it and put that down as sand.

1035
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you're missing a trick,

1036
00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you could've done
something more with this.

1037
00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It just falls a little bit flat.

1038
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, Kim-Joy.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, we came into the Showstopper
with Kim-Joy just fractionally ahead.

1043
00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think
she played it a little bit safe

1044
00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because it wasn't nearly as much
as Ruby or Rahul did.

1045
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That style of his,
it's quite rough and ready

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but because it was a landscape,
it fell into his brief.

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Ruby's passionfruit cake.

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That sponge was delicious. So light,
and the biscuit was good as well.

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But do we have an outright winner?

1051
00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We need to look at the three challenges
together and they all did very, very well.

1052
00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:04.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me, one of the bakers
made the most consistent bakes

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:54.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the amazing thing about Rahul
and why I'm so proud of him

1111
00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:58.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is that he came in unconfident
but he just kept going

1112
00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and he never reined in his ambition,

1113
00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he always tried to do a bit more
than everybody else. And it paid off.

1114
00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:09.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you'll miss when you're not with him.

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:18.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think he realises
still how good he actually is.

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:20.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

what's magic about Rahul.
