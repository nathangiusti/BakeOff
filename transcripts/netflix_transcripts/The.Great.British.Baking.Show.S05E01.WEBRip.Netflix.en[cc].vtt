59
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and indeed fruit is entirely up to you,
but it must be fresh fruit.

60
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No dried fruit allowed.

61
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Basically, what we are saying

62
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is that if it was a fruit party,
sultanas would not be on the guest list.

-Do you want to do it?

65
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both] On your marks. Get set. Bake.

66
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Plain flour.

67
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The reason why the fruity cake
challenge is such a great signature

68
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to start off the series with is because
it really tests the baker's knowledge

69
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of baking in its purest form.

70
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>How much moisture</i>
<i>is that fruit going to release?</i>

71
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>What that does is make</i>
<i>the inside of the cake quite soggy.</i>

72
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what's difficult to judge
is when it is baked properly.

73
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you stick a skewer in,
to see if the cake is done,

74
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the skewer may well come out wet
because it's hit a piece of fresh fruit

75
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you will be fooled into thinking
the cake isn't done.

76
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Paul] I think it looks great.
It looks well baked.

407
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I noticed?

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

414
00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Loads of orange flavour coming through.

415
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know, I think there is enough
citrus in there?

416
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lemon curd is lovely, but unless
you are very restrained about it

417
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it would have been overpowering.

424
00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Texture's not right in the middle

425
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-because it all got squashed.
-Okay.

426
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is a bit stodgy.

427
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit boring.

428
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Urgh, God.

429
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] I'm not getting a huge amount

430
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm getting the sponge
and I'm getting the apple.

431
00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not light as air, but it is a good sponge.

432
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I think you've got away with it,
considering that was

433
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-your second one, as well.
-I'll take that as a win.

434
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-Maybe a draw.

435
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. [laughs]

436
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

437
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the bonfire flames.
The shine of the toffee is perfect.

438
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

439
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To get that texture of apple,
which is just slightly soft

440
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then you have those gorgeous
warming spices coming through.

441
00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

448
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Looks as if
the apple has sunk a little.

449
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The bake's okay,
but I get a hint of cinnamon.

450
00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not convinced that
the whole thing together works.

451
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

-Wet in the middle.

453
00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It's been flooded with water
all the time, while it's in the oven.

454
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nothing that a lot of custard
wouldn't help.

455
00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] It's very neat. The piping's good.

456
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Oh, look at that sponge.

457
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that texture's lovely.

458
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pineapple flavour comes
walloping through.

459
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You must have dried
the pineapple a bit too?

460
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

465
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pineapple that comes through there
is delicious and that silkiness

466

that come from the Italian meringue
just works so well with that.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so they seem like an easy cake.

509
00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In fact they are very difficult to do.

510
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They must look identical and neat.

511
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Inside, soft chocolate sponge.

512
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because there is no flour in it,
there's no baking powder.

513
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're relying entirely on the egg whites
to rise the sponge.

514
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And there's peppermint buttercream,

515
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which if you put too much essence in,
tastes like toothpaste.

516
00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it must make a perfect swirl.

517
00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All together not an easy task.

518
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's delicious to eat.

519
00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very chocolaty sponge with that
flavour of peppermint but not too much.

520
00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's see what they're made of

521
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and all I can say is that
I have more difficult challenges to come.

522
00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Charming.
-[laughs]

523
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The recipe is telling me that I have to...

524
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Make a paste with cocoa, butter...

525
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One teaspoon full of vanilla extract.
Four tablespoons of water.

526
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's looking like
it should be the right consistency.

527
00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My first cake wasn't brilliant, so I
need to pull it back a bit with this one.

528
00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then the next instruction, whisk the
egg yolks with two thirds of the sugar.

529
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then mix egg yolks with the paste.

530
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Stacey] Lovely jubbly.

531
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whisk the egg whites
with the remaining sugar.

532
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is getting enough air
into the egg whites

533
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to give it a really nice light texture.

534
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kate] That will do.

535
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gently folding in.

536
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice and smooth, but still plenty of body

537
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the egg
is the only raising agent in this.

538
00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you miss that step out,
then I think you could be in trouble.

539
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whisk in the egg whites
to the remaining sugar.

540
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How you feeling after the first one?

541
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Meh. So if I come mid-table for this,

542
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-it should be all right. Going in.
-Yeah. Okay.

543
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Big breath. Big breath.
-[exhales]

544
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here it goes.

545
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It says 12 to 20, but that's pretty vague.

546
00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, I don't know. Don't know.

547
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Steven] I'm going to do 12 minutes

548
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because as soon as they lose that moisture
they'll just crack as they roll.

549
00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See you in 12.

550
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This isn't right,
Chrissy, this isn't right.

551
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I can't work out
what I'm not doing right, actually.

552
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe it's supposed to be like that?

553
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's next?
-Got to make the buttercream.

554
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's something you've done before?

555
00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm joking. [laughs]

556
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're still joking, that's good.

557
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, but joking can only get you so far.

558
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, thanks a lot.

559
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Doesn't say how much peppermint
essence to put in.

560
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Start off by doing
a quarter of a teaspoon.

561
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just put in a... [vocalises]
And then I'll see.

562
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour is not too overpowering.

563
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it needs a bit more.

564
00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Doesn't taste like toothpaste.

565
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you are halfway through
the making of your mini marvels.

566
00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sophie] I just want to get to the point
where they are quite flexible.

567
00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They don't look done at all.

568
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anytime soon.

569
00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Slightly sinking in one bit.

570
00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's me done, guys.

571
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know if I should
do it again or not?

572
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flat as a pancake, so I'm starting again.

573
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm starting again as well.

574
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing like a bit of stress.

575
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

576
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:33.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They seem a bit rubbery.

577
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want to redo my sponges.

578
00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think, I didn't fold it in
very well, maybe?

579
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That looks disgusting, doesn't it?

580
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I need to mix
it for a bit longer.

581
00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Trying not to lose the air.

582
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yep, quite happy with those.

583
00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Second time, lucky.

584
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Melt the plain and milk chocolate
together.

585
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got dark and milk chocolate in here.

586
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It will be nice.
-It's a chocolate feast.

587
00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That is pure...
-Wow.

588
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can actually feel my hips widening
as we do it.

589
00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that good?

590
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Er, well, it's a thing.
-Okay.

591
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then the white chocolate,
presumably to drizzle over.

592
00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I made a mistake.

593
00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've put white chocolates
in the milk chocolate.

594
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See if I can do something with it.

595
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See you again in 12 minutes.

596
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got half an hour left
on your mini-rolls.

597
00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here.

598
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[thud]
-He's bowled over.

599
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Spread the filling
over the cooled sponges.

600
00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got to make sure there's
even spreading of the buttercream.

601
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Make sure I get right to the edges.

602
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want a nice tight curl.

603
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. So, roll from each short end
so that it meets in the middle.

604
00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kate] Roll it like that.
Roll it the other way.

605
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then cut that in half.

606
00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And do the same with the other one.

607
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've just scored it a little bit to try
and get it nice and tight.

608
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Using the piece of paper to help me.

609
00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just making sure the roll is tight.
It is fiddly.

610
00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] It's all sticking.

611
00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Liam] I didn't realise that it would be
this much pressure.

612
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, relief.

613
00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so take a centimetre off each side
and works out at six centimetres each.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

627
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because we are allowed an exposed bottom,
I will just pour it all on.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Use the white chocolate to decorate
it in some unspecified way.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Prue] It's not perfect.

653
00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] There is white chocolate on the top

It's a shame they look the way they do.

661
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

662
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're quite small
so there should be a good swirl.

663

664
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sponge is actually not very spongy.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

that one, I think.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

689
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The white chocolate has been blobbed
on the top from about ten foot, I reckon.

690
00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The sponge has not been cooked
enough, so it's very squashed and thin.

692
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's got a good banana flavour.

1028
00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The cakes are slightly too dry.

1029
00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's unfortunate,
but that design is incredible.

1030
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] I think you could have
done more with it.

1031
00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's not detailed enough.
-Yep.

1032
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the flavour.
I think it's a little dry.

1033
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-It so nearly worked, didn't it?
-[laughs]

1034
00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:45.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That glass looks great.

1035
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just such a shame you lost it at the top.
-[Kate] Yeah.

1036
00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Texture's nice. Very moist.

1037
00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice flavour. I like it.

1038
00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] It's collapsed a bit there,
hasn't it?

1039
00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It did. It needed more time
before I iced it.

1040
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm, very nice flavour.

1041
00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a bit dry, but the chocolate,
the coffee is delicious.

1042
00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-It's a little bit basic on the outside.
-Sure.

1043
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is so exciting.

1044
00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, that's disappointing.
-We can see it.

1045
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, that's brilliant, that bit.
-[all laughing]

1046
00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Very almondy flavour.

1047
00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it comes down to the texture.
It's a little bit too dense for me.

1048
00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flo. Please bring up your illusion cake.

1049
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you saw that in the greengrocer shop,
you would think it was a watermelon.

1050
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I'm dying to see
what it looks like inside.

1051
00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

1052
00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Oh, there you go.

1053
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Look at that.
-[Noel] Wowzers.

1054
00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] That's excellent there.

1055
00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, this has got watermelon syrup

1056
00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-in here as well, hasn't it?
-Yeah.

1057
00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want some with the chocolate in.

1058
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't really get the watermelon,
but then my mouth is full of chocolate,

1059
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
what's the matter with that?
I think it's wonderful.

1060
00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Your sponge is spot on.

1061
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the colour you've got inside
and the chocolate just highlights it

1062
00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and lifts it up.

1063
00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I love you, Flo.
-I love you too, now.

1064
00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

1065
00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:30.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It's the fattest Russian Doll
I have ever seen.

1066
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Proper Siberian.
-Is that right?

1067
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-[all laughing]

1068
00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] Oh, look at that.
-[applause]

1069
00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Right, let's see
if we can cut into her.

1070
00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:49.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I find the cake a little bit plain
and a little bit dry.

1071
00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a little bit simplistic.

1072
00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I think it's a pity
about the knife.

1073
00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit dry.

1074
00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The flavour in there is beautiful.

1075
00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just think you've left it in there
a little bit too long.

1076
00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not certain that I would know
it was a handbag.

1077
00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's looks like a decorated cake
rather than a hang bag.

1078
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But what's more important is,
is it a great cake?

1079
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think it's delicious.
-Thank you.

1080
00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Certainly a bit sticky in your mouth.

1081
00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You wouldn't want to eat a lot of it
because it's so rich.

1082
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] The sponge is delicious.
What throws you is the colour.

1083
00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:42.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Overall not really overwhelmed
by the design.

1084
00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] I have to say,
the champagne bottle looks amazing.

1085
00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's really beautifully done.

1086
00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Oops.
-[chuckles]

1087
00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'll just get that before it melts.
-[all laughing]

1088
00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Surprisingly dry.
-Okay.

1089
00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The ganache is making it even drier,

1090
00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the flavour
of the chocolate's nice.

1091
00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Steven, please bring up
your illusion cake.

1092
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow.

1093
00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is stunning.

1094
00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Without a shadow of a doubt
you know exactly what that is.

1095
00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Absolutely astonishing.

1096
00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You wouldn't think that wasn't bread,
would you?

1097
00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Steven] It is a chocolate hazelnut sponge
with a peanut butter frosting.

1098
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's perfect.

1099
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The hazelnut. The peanut. The frosting.

1100
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The layers are equal. The outside.
The colour, the texture, it's all there.

1101
00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And it's not too sweet.
I think it's lovely.

1102
00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-[exhales]

1103
00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-Thank you.

1104
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done.

1105
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Liam, please bring up your illusion cake.

1106
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I have to say,
I think it looks delicious.

1107
00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:53.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It makes my mouth water.
I want to come to yours for breakfast.

1108
00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Any time.
-It just...

1109
00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just so lovely.

1110
00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1111
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean,
it really is very difficult to believe

1112
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that that's not pancakes.

1113
00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's ingenious,
but it's got to taste good as well.

1114
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a lot going on in here as well,
isn't there?

1115
00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-[Prue] Hmm.

1116
00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um... I was expecting more banana flavour.

1117
00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that's because
the blueberries overpower it.

1118
00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-But it's delicious. A mouthful is lovely.

1119
00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Okay.
-I think your banana cake is beautiful.

1120
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

hasn't it?

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a cracking good watermelon.

1128
00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Stephen didn't fail us on the showstopper.

1130

Nobody wants to be the first person
to leave, but who is in some danger?

Liam saved himself with that showstopper.
It was stunning.

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

His flavours are spectacular,
but his baking falls short.

1137
00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:37.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I have to say
none of it sounds straightforward.

1138
00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have to send somebody away, don't we?

Bakers, it is my tremendous privilege
to announce the very first star baker.

1147
00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The star baker is the person
whose showstopper

1148
00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:18.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
was honestly the best thing
since sliced bread.

1149
00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:21.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Oh, bakers. Ah, sadly I have to
deliver the bad news.

1152
00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

1156
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give us a hug. Come on.

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

done things differently

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Paul] The standard this year is so high

1166
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that unfortunately it was Peter's turn.

1167
00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I understand it was the flavours
that has put me a whisker above Peter.

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I won't be telling them anything
that they don't know.
