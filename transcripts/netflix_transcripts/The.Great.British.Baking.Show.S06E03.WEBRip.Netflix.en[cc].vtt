00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I always use a thread

309
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I'm hoping that will give me

310
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a nice, sharp, clean cut.

311
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] It doesn't squash them down,

312
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which can happen when you use a knife.

313
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although saying that, I've just realised
how wonky that one is.

314
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know how much they're gonna spread

315
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and grow and hopefully
this is a good guess.

316
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Manon] Gonna make them
a little heart shape.

317
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Pretty happy with those.

318
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although you never really know
until they've had their second prove.

319
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] Do your thing. Please be good.

320
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um, I've made a complete mess.

321
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Before I rolled my dough
I should have sprinkled this

322
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
over the fruit and I haven't.

323
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolute disaster.

324
00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is not the way to do it.

325
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's whether they stay together now.

326
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my life.

327
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As we were.

328
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] God, look at the time.

329
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bakers, you only have one hour left.

330
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, God.

331
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you doing
for the next 25 minutes?

333
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Stressing.

337
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Five more minutes? Not five more minutes?

338
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it gonna over prove? Under prove? Ah!

339

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do not want them to go... flat.

341
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] I need it to hurry up and rise.

342
00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I need to get a move on.

343
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, what shall I do?
Wait a couple more minutes? I don't know.

344
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. It's always a stressy moment.

345
00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My head's inside the prover right now.

346
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't think.

347
00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

348
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

349
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-I know. I know.

350
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jon] They look ready.

351
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know why I'm second guessing it.

352
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Makes me nervous.

353
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul's prowling around like a bear.

354
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He can mess with your head, can't he?

355
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ruby] I can't ever tell
what he's thinking.

356
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think he wants to see my buns?

359
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Are you proved already?

360
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] God, they're massive.

361
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] They're gonna get
even more massive in the oven.

362
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have you ever had it
where the middles explode upwards?

363
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, don't say that to me now.

364
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] I'm gonna put them in the oven

365
00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
if I can get them out of the proving bag.

366
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll be back in a few days.

367
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] They're not very uniform,

368
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you don't start poking dough
about once it's proved.

369
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What you doing? Prodding?

370
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just opening the swirl
up a little bit.

371
00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, chucking them in.

372
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Noel] Really?
-What do you mean "really"?

373
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is it time?
-Don't get in my head.

374
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Be well.

375
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have half an hour left.
Half an hour.

376
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, let's put the sign of the cross

377
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that's going in.

378
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Karen] Do your best.

379
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jon] Nineteen minutes.

380
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go.

381
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] They're on their way up.

382
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The yeast just has that last burst
of energy but then it dies.

383
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's dying right now.

384
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it's for a good cause.

385
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Terry] Considering the disaster
of forgetting the sugar,

386
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think they've come out okay.

387
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It might be the new way. [laughs]

388
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Briony] They've gone a little bit
too poufy in places, but they're big.

389
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] I think they're massive that's why
they're taking much time to cook.

390
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will just leave it. The more I see it,
the more I get stressed.

391
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Antony] I'm hoping it bakes.
Shall I start again?

392
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

394
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, come on, please. Please.

395
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just need it to be about 92 degrees.

396
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Ninety-one.

397
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ninety-two. I guess they're done then.

398
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, my God.
They never look like that at home.

399
00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Manon] I think I've cooked them
a little bit too much.

400
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm just worried that Paul is gonna say,
it's a bit over baked.

401
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm quite pleased with it.
I think tangzhong is amazing.

402
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This one's taking ages to bake.

[Antony] Terry behind me has said
good things take a long time.

405
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] Yeah,
but his are already out, so...

406
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

407
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is a big waiting game
but it's worth it.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bakers, you have one minute.
Just one minute.

409
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] One minute.

410
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jon] This is my little bluebirds.

411
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gold spray. So if nothing else
it will be colourful.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm happy with that.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] I think they need
a little bit longer.

414
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Terry] Considering the disaster,
they could have been,

415
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
if they taste okay, I'll be happy.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are gonna say it's messy, again.

417
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rahul] All right, let's do it.
One. Two. Three.

418
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God, it's very hot. Oh!

419
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Done-zo!

420
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] Go. Go. Go. Go.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-You're welcome.

[Sandi] Please place your Chelsea buns
at the end of your benches.

424
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Job's done.

425
00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stop, Rahul.
-Yep.

426
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't make me come over there.

427
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

[Noel] <i>The bakers Chelsea buns</i>

429
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>of Paul and Prue.</i>

430
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-They look pretty even.
-[Paul] Hmm.

431
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] Got a nice colour on em.
The tangzhong,

432
00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's gonna be interesting to see
how that affects the dough.

433
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's offered up
a very delicate dough.

434
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quite soft,
which is good for a Chelsea bun.

435
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, I think your baking is very good.

436
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the flavours.
Is there citrus in there as well?

437
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, a little bit.

438
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's the overriding flavour
that you get.

439
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's delicate and it needs to be
a little more obvious.

440
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] They're heart shaped, aren't they?
[Manon] Yes.

441
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very neat. Slightly overbaked.

442
00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:24.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] The edges definitely tough.

443
00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The flavour's fantastic.

444
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The marzipan really works with the fruit
and the apricots as well.

445
00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:31.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The dough has got a gorgeous structure.

446
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you brought it out five, seven minutes
earlier, they would have been perfect.

447
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

448
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] They're all even.

449
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Got a nice colour.
They break apart neatly.

450
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely delicious.

451
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really sticky on the outside.
Great orange. Bang of flavour.

452
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, really good.

453
00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dan...

454
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ah.
-It's perfect.

455
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.

456
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's annoyingly perfect

457
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I'll tell you why.

458
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your structures are regular,
it's beautiful and soft.

459
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your interior has a good
overwhelming orange flavour

460
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and even the decoration
sits on top beautifully.

461
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a well-made Chelsea bun that.

462
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dan, we're in love with you.

464
00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done. [laughs]

465
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] I think it looks impressive.

466
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's overbaked.

467
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It shouldn't be crispy.

468
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The structure's good.

469
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Soft but the outside is tough.

470
00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

471
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The overall impression is of dryness,

472
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is such a pity because the flavours,

473
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
once you swallow everything,

474
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is just fantastic.

475
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] One of the qualities
of peanut butter is that it's very dry.

476
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When you have a dough that's very dry

477
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
what you're getting is dry.

478
00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Stop saying dry, everyone.
Everyone, stop saying dry.

479
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[laughs]
-Thanks, Noel.

480
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] I think they look
like the ones I make.

481
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] Looks lovely.

482
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tastes great.

483
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The dough's beautiful and soft.

484
00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The sweetness is about right too.

485
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But spread the fruit more evenly

486
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so you don't get these big gaps.

487
00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you had hit the filling, it's perfect.

488
00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

489
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
They look really pretty,
but they've exploded a bit, haven't they?

490
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] I know they have, yeah.

491
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] It hasn't been folded properly
and neatly enough.

492
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, okay.

493
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely and light. Nice dough.

494
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that's delicious.

495
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yay.

496
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour is very, very good.

497
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a shame it looks the way it does.

498
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Yeah, okay. Thank you.

499
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Prue] Do you know,
I think it looks really pretty.

500
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely flavour.

501
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Good.
-Structure is lovely.

502
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is well baked.
-Oh, good.

503
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love bakewell but I've had it
a few times from you now.

504
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Next bake you do please don't put anymore.

505
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was thinking though,

506
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you say signature, isn't that something

507
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-you always take everywhere you go?
-Hmm.

508
00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, there you go.
-There you go.

509
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

510
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you have sugar in your dough?

511
00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't, but there was sugar
in the carrot mixture.

512
00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not enough.

513
00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This feels hard. It feels crusty.

514
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's not how a Chelsea bun should be.
-Right. Okay.

515
00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that flavour's very interesting

516
00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I think it fundamentally lacks that...

517
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-...stickiness.

518
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mixture in a Chelsea bun don't work.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, okay.

520
00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispers] I'll have a word with him.

521
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, have a word.

522
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Paul] Well, I do like what you've done.

523
00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's quite impressive.

524
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It looks nice and spongy.

525
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it feels slightly overbaked.

526
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's overbaked.

527
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It is?
-Hmm.

528
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It should be much softer
than that on the palate.

529
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flavour's absolutely delicious.

530
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. That's what I wanted.

531
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the decoration
but not so fine a Chelsea bun.

532
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right. I'll put a liver bird
on the next one, how's that? [chuckles]

533
00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry about
that much fruit on the top.

534
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Are you trying to match my jumper?

535
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Well, it does look a bit messy

536
00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but I must say...
-[Rahul] Yeah.

537
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:41.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...it looks delicious.

538
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pulls apart lovely.

539
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very soft and gooey,

540
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is way a Chelsea bun should be.

541
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very interesting.

542
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Such savoury spices.

543
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean there's such a contrast
to the sweet fruit

544
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I really like that.

545
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's baked to perfection.

546
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the mango chutney is stunning.

547
00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very clever, Rahul.

548
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's a very good Chelsea bun.
-Thank you.

549
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don't need to apologise. You're great.

550
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just me being me.
I just feel so scared all the time

551

553
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God, look, pheasants.

554
00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Two-- Two male pheasants?

555
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a little bit baffled to be honest.

556
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

is, like, a strong point of mine

557
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

558
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hollywood Handshake. It's the second one.
Its old hat.

559
00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

560
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's got to be my best challenge yet.

561
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

562
00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's more baking in me, yet I think.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

for the Technical.

570
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prue got a look in when it came to setting
this week's Technical challenge.

571
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is a Hollywood Hurdle. Any advice?

572
00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] There's not much time
to complete this challenge

573
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so use your time wisely.

574
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] So the judges are looking
for eight naan breads.

579
00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They must be uniform in size
and brushed with garlic ghee.

580
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have one hour.

582
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:36.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

583
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dan] Right. Naan breads.

584
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing.

585
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] One hour. Not long.

586
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If nothing else, it'll be over quickly.

587
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jon] I love naan breads.

588
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've baked them a few times
but I've never done one without yeast.

[Kim-Joy] I have grilled bread before.

594
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't remember what I grilled

595
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Paul, why have we got naan

596
00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for our Technical Bake?

597
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm hoping to catch them out with this.

598
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a naan bread using baking powder.

599
00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Traditionally it would be yeast.

600
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But they'll have to use
their baking knowledge

601
00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because the kneading and resting
won't take as long

602
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as it would with a yeasted dough.

603
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] What can go wrong, Paul?

604
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With a dough that's quite wet
it's gonna be quite tricky

605
00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
'cause you're getting them
all the same size.

606
00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then they've got to grill them.

607
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They've got to heat that tray up properly.

608
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If they put a cold naan under the grill,

609
00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
gonna be spending at least five minutes,
maybe longer,

610
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the whole naan will dry out
and be like a cracker.

611
00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If they're too thick,
they're not gonna bake.

612
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely flavour.

613
00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I never thought you could do that
with a grill.

614
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

615
00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Absolutely.

616
00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

make the dough.

617
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

That's it.

618
00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

619
00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I've made naan bread the same as this,
no yeast.

625
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You just have to, like,
believe your instinct.

626
00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dan] I have almost zero instinct
on this one.

627
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, this is very wet, isn't it?

628
00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Briony] I hate kneading wet dough.

629
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Normally cheat and put it in the mixer

630
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but there ain't no mixer.

631
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Considering I was kneading dough
a few hours ago

632
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as well, this is quite hard work.

633
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Antony] Should be a little wet.

634
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just enough to bring it together

635
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'cause naan breads are very soft.

636
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ruby] Ah. The more I work it,

637
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it just does not seem to be
getting any smoother.

638
00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't really know what to do
with not yeasted dough. [laughs]

639
00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Feeling quite relaxed at the minute.

640
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, having decent comments
from the Signature challenge

641
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
puts you in good stead.

642
00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it's coming together now.
Couple more of these.

643
00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm gonna stop with my kneading.

644
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you gonna stop? I'm gonna stop.

645
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

646
00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There you go.

647
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Ah!

648
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rest the dough.
For how long? I do not know.

649
00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Probably about four minutes
on this challenge.

650
00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna be leaving it to rest
for about 20 minutes

651
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

652
00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Briony] Look at the state of it.
I don't even know what I'm doing.

653
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is there anything I can do for you?

-Could you?

656
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Noel] The cat has got a filthy mouth.

658
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Briony] That is a potty mouthed cat.

659
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Antony] A lot of people
say it's unhealthy,

661
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but every Indian will overdose

662
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
on this stuff
'cause it oils their joints. [laughs]

[Sandi] Onto the garlic.

665
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love garlic.

666
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To be honest, I'd put garlic
in my breakfast if I could, you know.

667
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Gotta love your garlic.

668
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've just taken the dough out.

669
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It feels quite wet but I think
it's meant to be a little bit wet.

670
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

673
00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Close enough.

674
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have you had many Indian takeaways?
'Cause I surprisingly haven't.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

676
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going for pitta bread shape.

677
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Classic teardrop shape for me naan.

678
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like a sort of baggy skull.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

682
00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So now...

684
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Heat the grill pan under the grill.

685
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lay the dough on the hot grill pan
and bake.

686
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Jon] I'd fry them at home,

687
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

He gets the grill.

694
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm gonna brush before and after,
'cause I think that's what I'd do.

695
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

697
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

have to go four in at a time.

699
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I don't know if that's a bad idea
and they're just gonna, like, explode.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

701
00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't really know how long these things
need to bake for.

702
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If it's burning, it's done.

703
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If it's not burnt, you might be lucky.

704
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm having a little bit of a trial
on this first one.

705
00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want relatively crispy outside
with a nice, soft, doughy inside.

706
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Absolutely no idea. I'm gonna come back
to them in two minutes.

707
00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it should just be about
four or five minutes each.

708
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

711
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

714
00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A bit too crispy for my taste,
but let's turn them over.

just a couple of seconds.

717
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kim-Joy] They're not
very brown underneath.

718
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, bakers, you have 15 minutes left.
Just 15 minutes.

719
00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:36.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

they look totally different,

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I ain't got time to mess around.
They'll have to come out.

723

725
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

781
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

785
00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

that you've got a good colour.

792
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Paul] A bit inconsistent in shape.
[Prue] And size.

795
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Paul] Look at the size of them. Wow.

800
00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flavour's good.

801
00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, these got a nice colour.
They're nice and light.

802
00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Prue] That's undercooked on one side.

803
00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's a pity, that, 'cause its nice bread,
isn't it?

804
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just more like a thick pitta.

805
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kim-Joy] Now looking at these,

806
00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the inconsistency in the baking...

807
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, dear. Look at that.

808

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Right, last one.

810
00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

812
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

814
00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:45.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

815
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

819
00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

823
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

824
00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:29.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a shotgun wedding, isn't it?

1250
00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean there are an awful lot
of kittens already.

1251
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:20.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1252
00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sandi] Thats their friends.

1253
00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] Oh, they're friends.
They're their friends.

1254
00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think the bread looks incredible.

1255
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a lovely bit of plait work as well

1256
00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:29.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I think the cats are amazing.

1257
00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:31.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It really is charming.

1258
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Right, let's have a look.

1259
00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] That looks lovely.

1260
00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Quite like a hot cross bun, isn't it?
-It is, yeah.

1261
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kind of liked a little more fruit in it.

1262
00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] And it's bit tight.
So it's a little bit cake like.

1263
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Another half an hour proving
that would have been perfect.

1264
00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tastes good though.

1265
00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And it's certainly celebratory.
-[Paul] Thank you

1266
00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you
-[Prue] Thank you

1267
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] We wanted
a highly decorative korovai

1268
00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and that's it.
-That's it.

1269
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] It really is a showstopper.

1270
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The detail of the swans

1271
00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the decorations
are just absolutely lovely.

1272
00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I hope it tastes
as good as it looks.

1273
00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Oh, look at that.

1274
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I like that texture. It's like panettone.

1275
00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's fantastic.

1276
00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can see the swirls of the dough.

1277
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The fruit in there is delicious
and that orange tang.

1278
00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're a little genius, Rahul.

1279
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1280
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you.
-Well done, Rahul.

1281
00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

1282
00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's simple and effective.

1283
00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The colour of the bakes are consistent.

1284
00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dan, you must have spent a long time
on the decorations

1285
00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and they are absolutely exquisite.

1286
00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And a lovely texture.

1287
00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beautifully baked.

1288
00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It really is. The structure that
you've managed to achieve

1289
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is very brioche like.

1290
00:48:58.760 --> 00:48:59.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it needs something else.

1291
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It needs fruit in there.

1292
00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour is not strong enough.

1293
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:03.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. [sighs]

1294
00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The attention to detail on the decoration
is spectacular.

1295
00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Particularly when you look at the hearts,
the plaiting is very, very good.

1296
00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Lots of filling.

1297
00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love the almond flavour.

1298
00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perfection.

1299
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've made a lot of couronnes in my time

1300
00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:29.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the bake that laces its way
through the fruit

1301
00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is to be applauded.

1302
00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:31.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1303
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That is absolutely stunning.
I could eat the whole thing.

1304
00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my goodness.

1305
00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:35.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] Thank you.

1306
00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[clapping]

1307
00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great job, Ruby.

1308
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:46.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] It's certainly colourful
but it does look a bit clumsy.

1309
00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] I think what you've done is,

1310
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you've put two very heavy breads

1311
00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
on top of a bread that's warm.

1312
00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The whole thing's sunk in.

1313
00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. I'm not happy
with it at all, to be honest.

1314
00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] And it's a bit heavy
where it's squashed together.

1315
00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've got too much fruit in there.

1316
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The flavour of it is fantastic.

1317
00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:03.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, thank you for that.

1318
00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just think the texture, the look,
the whole thing is an issue.

1319
00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Bad luck, Jon. Not perfect.
-Thank you, Jon.

1320
00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks.

1321
00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My goodness.

1322
00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

1323
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the fact that
they're muted colours.

1324
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-It's lovely.

1325
00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] I think the decoration's
incredible. It's intricate.

1326
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do look at the colour of the bread
and wonder what it's like inside.

1327
00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So do I. I have to say.
-[Prue laughs]

1328
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all laughing]

1329
00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:35.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Prue] The bread's a bit
doughy in the middle.

1330
00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've had to give it
that strong colour to try and bake it

1331
00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because it's underproved.

1332
00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's so disappointing
because it looks so amazing.

1333
00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It show stops from the outside.

1334
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bit of a stopper in the inside.

1335
00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No problem.

1336
00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

1337
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Antony] Just to add to the drama.

1338
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hoping these lovebirds
go down the zip line.

1339
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:01.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all] Ah!

1340
00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[clapping]

1341
00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] It's simple but effective.

1342
00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I worry about the colour of that

1343
00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:08.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it could be down to the chocolate.

1344
00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:09.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And there are not very many decorations.

1345
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Antony] Yeah, I did have a problem
with time management, unfortunately.

1346
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I couldn't
get all my décor on the cake.

1347
00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:19.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a bit heavy.

1348
00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, not the word.

1349
00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:22.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] If it's not proved enough

1350
00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then it's overbaked,
and you end up with a stodge.

1351
00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not your best, Antony.

1352
00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It's not my best.
-[Paul] Thank you, Antony.

1353
00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cheers, guys. Thank you so much.

1354
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still smiling.

1355
00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:33.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still smiling.

1356
00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] The decoration's amazing.

1357
00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's almost you concentrated on that
and lost the bread.

1358
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All the work that you did you can't see.

1359
00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And actually parts of the bread's
been ripped off.

1360
00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Prue] Did it get stuck on the tin?

1361
00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:51.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It did yes. Yeah.

1362
00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The whole thing

1363
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is not baked. It's massively under proved.

1364
00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

1365
00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But my goodness, the flavour is lovely.

1366
00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's very citrusy and sweet. Delicious.

1367
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Paul] How long was the first prove?

1368
00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thirty minutes.
-And the second one?

1369
00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fifteen.

1370
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fifteen? And then you baked it?

1371
00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:07.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

1372
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's where your problem is.

1373
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It should have been at least two hours.

1374
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The idea's sound enough but unfortunately
not very well executed.

1375
00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's fair play.

1376
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I love the Fabergé egg on the top,

1377
00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:24.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and this lattice is lovely.

1378
00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I hope it tastes as good as it looks.

1379
00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] You've managed
to utilise the dead dough

1380
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
together with the bread
and it works as a package.

1381
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So well done.

1382
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, let's have a look.

1383
00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:40.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The orange flower water is too strong.
It's like bath bubbles.

1384
00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, no.

1385
00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:42.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know what? You're lacking salt.

1386
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I think it's effected the texture
of the loaf as well.

1387
00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:46.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The design is impeccable

1388
00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I think everything inside is wrong.

1389
00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's okay. Thank you.
-Thank you.

1390
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The slightly Leaning Tower of Pisa.
-[Briony] It is. Yeah.

1391
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks very basic.

1392
00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you know what?

1393
00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I love the way you've embedded
the towers in the dough.

1394
00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you.

1395
00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Noel] Aw!

1396
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bye, Prince.

1397
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's dead now.

1398
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, happy ending for Rapunzel.

1399
00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think for a celebration korovai,

1400
00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it really needs more flavour
or fruit or something.

1401
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Paul] It's definitely underproved.
-Okay.

1402
00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's so tight. You needed

1403
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
about another half hour, maybe longer.

1404
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[exhales]

1405
00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Noel] That was quite a tricky
showstopper, wasn't it?

1406
00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Paul] A lot of them were underbaked
and underproved,

1407
00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:50.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is sad,
because five hours is a long time.

1408
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I think there's a couple of people
in line for Star Baker.

1409
00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I think Dan.
-[Sandi] He's our steady man, isn't he?

1410
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He is.
-And Rahul.

1411
00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Rahul.
-Who thinks he can't do anything

1412
00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but he's a really, really good baker.

1413
00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never met anyone like Rahul.

1414
00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-He's like an enigma.

1415
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:07.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sandi] Well, Jon certainly did not have
a good showstopper.

1416
00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Strange was he did so well
with the Technical, he came second.

1417
00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:11.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean likewise,
when you're looking at Terry,

1418
00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
who won the Technical,

1419
00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:15.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he was doing quite well
and his Showstopper was terrible.

1420
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I cannot stop thinking
about the flavours of Ruby's.

1421
00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yet again, it seems to me,
she's saved herself.

1422
00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She was in serious trouble
coming into today

1423
00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but to smash it out the park again
with that showstopper.

1424
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You said perfection.

1425
00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know.

1426
00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But unfortunately,
it leaves a couple of people

1427
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:32.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
who really let themselves down today.

1428
00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One was Briony. Overall, I think Briony

1429
00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
struggled over the three challenges.

1430
00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:39.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Certainly, Antony. Flavours didn't work.
Texture wasn't good.

1431
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The zip line was good.
-Yes.

1432
00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The zip line was good.

1433
00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I think there's not enough
with the bread really.

1434
00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No?
-No.

1435
00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, bakers,
what a bread fuelled weekend.

1436
00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well done for surviving.

1437
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:06.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got the great job of announcing
this week's Star Baker.

1438
00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:09.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's someone that the judges' thought
was fantastic throughout.

1439
00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:13.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And someone who showed a lot of swagger
in the showstopper.

1440
00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The Star Baker this week is...

1441
00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:18.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rahul.

1442
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[cheering]

1443
00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:23.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well done.
-I'm gonna kill him.

1444
00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:28.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, that means I get the horrible job.

1445
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm afraid we do have to say goodbye

1446
00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:33.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to somebody and that person is...

1447
00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:38.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on. Just say it.

1448
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Antony.

1449
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so sorry.

1450
00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, sorry, sweetheart.

1451
00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Antony] <i>Too soon. Leaving too soon </i>

1452
00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I don't think I'll stop smiling
'cause you know what?

1453
00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:53.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is for me,
the best opportunity ever.

1454
00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Come on, ladies. Come on.
-Come on, bring it in.

1455
00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Antony] <i>I've met</i>
<i>some of the most amazing people,</i>

1456
00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:02.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I'm smiling 'cause, you know what,
this isn't sad. [chuckles]

1457
00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These are just happy tears

1458
00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm leaving but still happy tears.

1459
00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
